__label__0 99 999 pure crap and the other 001 was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe nope the dialogue was legendarily bad the action sucked and there was no sex the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i ve ever seen on film and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis the only names in this movie and marina sirtis looked really really bad i ve seen high school plays more capably produced this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on heads should roll at sci fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air 
__label__1 idiotic hack crooks a babe a safe a plan and a baby add them all up and you get the best comedy you ve never heard of even with some a list star power at least a minus okay b plus this movie got very little publicity but that does not diminish its genius terrific writing solid delivery and a believable group of characters some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the end this is not some watered down nutty professor comedy these are low life bad guys they speak low life bad guy language and they do low life bad guy things but they do it for your amusement and entertainment and they do that well one of the best comedies i ve ever seen 
__label__1 h g wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour at the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species natural biology on one side and marxism market economy on the other side were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race first of all the non caucasian with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages then within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy the alcoholics the mentally disabled all those who were genetically disabled etc that was not hitler that was h g wells and that was not after the first world war that was more than ten years before and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human race left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth would see the differentiation of the human race into two species the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them the film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election no parliament no really democratic institution only peace imposed by military conquest and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors and in that future world all absolutely all human beings are caucasians wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036 amazing wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets frightening and that was produced in 1936 all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism fascism japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h g wells we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute democratic social selection or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days it would be unfair to go beyond this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals the fear that the future would only be somber bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
__label__1 while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feel good happy story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids won t understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the go to guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music 
__label__0 i had a really hard time making it through this move it was extermly slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life this movie seemed to flow to slow and i kept on wondering when it was going to end i am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what i was looking for it seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you as for me i felt i wasted 2 hours when i could of been doing something else 
__label__0 this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don t care what the critics say it s bad i think the problem is with kundera s novel it s not that it s unfilmable it s just that like 99 of his work it s pretentious and overdrawn he seems to be enamored with himself his characters come off as navel gazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works even his socialist realist poetry that was truly awful i just don t understand what the fuss is about characteristics like the self absorption in his novels make for infuriating reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified maybe i just missed something but i don t think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd no way is this movie that essential 
__label__1 friz freleng s rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic inducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country s military rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured don t badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts 
__label__1 night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film and the 2004 remake of dawn of the dead only this time with the homeless the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out why they treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie so now it s up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them this is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac dr dre song california love overall a good episode 8 10
__label__0 want to watch a scary horror film then steer clear of this one there s not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable however there is enough scotch single malt if you can manage it if the previous comments weren t enough to keep you from watching this film sober allow me to assist nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose things go downhill from there and wackiness ensues i actually read the book adaptation which was published and released only in the uk miles better than the film and the book was dreadful at least some pretense is made towards suspense and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author s rhymes with gas not to say that the film is completely without merit rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film and jonathan demme found that he s really better suited to direct yes there is an mst3k episode featuring this flick but it is of course edited quite a bit without the obligatory flashing of the breasts not even the healing power of scotch can save you please just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts i can not in all good conscience recommend this film to the sober film going public 
__label__1 just read the original story which is written by pu in 18th century strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty 
__label__0 this movie is awful i haven t laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time leno should ve stuck to stand up and late night tv the cars in the movie were cool but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie i ve ever seen it s pathetic the acting is horrible and the plot could ve been written by a 4 year old don t get me wrong jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie 
__label__0 i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art don t be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i don t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed the description on the back of the box doesn t even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then i ve lost all faith in humanity and don t even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations or that the cops didn t even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans :(
__label__0 i m a big fan of troma but i can t figure out why they bought the rights to this movie it s so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesn t know he s stuck with annoying tourists well they didn t seem to bother him in the movie just me the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan i like bad movie s but it was just boring 
__label__0 by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth instalment the official title of this film was rambo first blood part ii but it is more commonly known simply as rambo it starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in first blood although this is never made too explicit he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer colonel trautman for a secret mission rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american pows are still being held captive by the communist regime he is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a fact finding mission what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by trautman who is portrayed as brave honourable and incorruptible but by the organiser of the mission a military bureaucrat named murdock murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the american and vietnamese governments partly because it will make his own life easier unfortunately for murdock rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in hellish conditions of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies including a beautiful vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their russian allies most of the evil commies of course end up dead although i was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67 at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire vietnamese army the tone of this film is very different from the first in first blood rambo was unquestionably a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability in rambo he is a bona fide all american hero a few years earlier the director george pan cosmatos had made the cassandra crossing a biased piece of left wing anti american propaganda cosmatos however was nothing if not versatile and rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right wing pro american propaganda the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad first blood had its faults but it also had its virtues its stance that the anti war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing it is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war rambo re fights the war single handed and this time the right side wins take that charlie cong by this point no doubt the film s admirers and there seem to be plenty more than 2 000 voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that i am a liberal commie loving pinko far from it in fact i have always despised communism as a pernicious ideology what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including ideological disputes is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible it makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of south east asia or why not everyone in the region was pro american for all its anti communism the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the world s problems to capitalism or imperialism or revisionism or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to compared to rambo the green berets was a masterly piece of political analysis 3 10
__label__1 hey now i can t claim to have seen all of the films of jesse jesus franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that i have seen i d say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points this woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience and she seems to have this problem with dreaming the catch to what s real and what s not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn t she seems to exist in a state of deja vu i won t say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere the ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point my copy was from the anchor bay euro trash collection and i say give me more euro trash i can t get enough of that crap but it s good crap 
__label__0 this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything 
__label__0 up until the last few minutes of the movie i would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars however the ending is so terrible and hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80 of the movie the plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles the captain gene hackman is all for launching while his first officer denzel washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first the problem is to launch both the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys hackman is determined to launch and washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched cool however here comes the part that just doesn t ring true after they are back on land and go before a review board washington and hackman who d just spent half the movie trying to kill each other shake hands and are all buddy buddy huh too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me 
__label__1 this was an excellent 2 part episode although i had never been seen the older ones i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal extra terrestial of course but not paranormal this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans in a futuristic time would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible being that it s a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith especially if its also going to entertain american audiences but who care about what yanks say we rock doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 first being so harmless to scary from fun to serious from light to darkness i hope many old fans will one day soon say the old doctor who has returned 10 out of 10
__label__0 a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub genre the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set pieces that we ve all seen a hundred times before has great potential as an insomnia treatment 
__label__0 this low grade universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release which is just as well since the end result was not anything particularly special if decently atmospheric at that for starters the plot is pretty weak even though in a way it anticipates the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood 1973 albeit without any of that film s campy gusto what we have here in fact is a penniless sculptor martin kosleck whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat who upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic alan napier s vitriolic pen one time too many decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river however while contemplating just that action he is anticipated by rondo hatton s escaped killer dubbed the creeper and naturally enough saves the poor guy s life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude although it is supposedly set in the art circles of new york all we really see at work is kosleck and commercial painter robert lowery who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl joan shawlee over and over in banal poses how is that for art who conveniently enough is engaged to a rival art critic virginia grey of napier s before long the latter is discovered with his spine broken and lowery is suspected but then investigating detective bill goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of lowery s work i did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be in the meantime kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting hatton s uniquely craggy and recognizable visage which needless to say attracts the attention of the constantly visiting grey we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column much to the chagrin of both artist and model bafflingly although the creeper is fully aware of how grey looks thanks to her aforementioned haunting of kosleck s flea bitten pad he bumps off shawlee who had by then become goodwin s girl in lowery s apartment and overhearing kosleck talking to you guessed it grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police sends the slow witted giant off his deep end even down to destroying his own now completed stony image curiously enough although this was hatton s penultimate film his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet introducing

__label__0 and that is the only reason i posses this dvd now i haven t seen the first nemesis film but i did check the info out of it and i here by say what why because in the first film alex was male but then again the first one was set in the future so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time who knows at least it wasn t addressed in the film in any way here s a quick summary of the plot alex still a baby then or how ever you want as it was is in the future escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80 s africa there mommy gets killed and alex sue price grows up in a african tribe then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg so there does sound familiar doesn t it terminator isn t the only film being ripped here predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie the vincent price one gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from lets see what else okay the film was quite standard small budget flick but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90 s film it would have looked okay for a 80 s flick how ever biggest problem is the plot things just happen and the viewer is barely interested nemesis 2 isn t the crappiest piece of cinema i ve had pleasure to watch but it does come damn close i won t say a thing about acting because let s be honest here did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here oh well at least i did find sue price hot in that amazonian warrior way a real movie rating 2 10 there isn t a lot of pros about the over all quality and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense a camp movie rating 4 10 i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film so it does have small merits in it 
__label__1 ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from according to jake speed they are based on real people living out the adventures they write about and publish this movie is quality family entertainment moderate amounts of violence and skimpy clothes at the worst the language is is also not a problem and the jokes are funny at all levels this is a austin powers look at indian jones without the over the top antics of michael myers i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range 
__label__0 the storyplot was okay by itself but the film felt very bubbly and fake it also had the worst ending they were probably going for a surprise ending but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was all other teen movies are better than this one 
__label__1 this film along with westfront 1918 are my favorite pabst directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks such as pandora s box it s probably because both are very similar to the neo realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s this style film called for using non actors just typical folks in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films in this case the film is about french and german coal miners so appropriately the people in the roles seem like miners not actors the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco german border instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine despite there being greater unemployment in germany this language differences illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions resulting in a we vs they mentality later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing risking their own lives they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen considering history though the film s impact was minimal at best it s a real shame as like this one westfront 1918 jáaccuse gance and all quiet on the western front milestone had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion so from a historical point of view it s an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing

__label__1 this film deals with the irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man s life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences watching the film i got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates do it again and it sadly would still fit contemporary events but te remake wouldn t be nearly as good a magnificent performance by victor mclaglen for which he deservedly got an oscar and a fine ensemble cast that includes most if not all the actors with brogues in hollywood at the time most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out a very good film well worth watching highly recommended

__label__1 this is one of three 80 s movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva a movie horribly overlook due to salva s legal sexual problems another would be cameron s closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated not great but not nearly as bad as the reviews i ve seen paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think i mean 10 years after i ve seen it and i still give it some pause whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether 
__label__1 riding giantsthis documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well made and acclaimed surfer films dana brown s endless summer its follow up endless summer ii by bruce brown dana s son and step into liquid imax i saw the first not the others while the surfing footage is spectacular i valued most the film maker s historic perspective he takes us back to the sport s origins almost a hundred years ago and shows how it evolved to its present form this includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers how surfboard designs changed over time which beaches in hawaii and california were most frequented by the world class surfers and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them the athletes lived for months at a time on beaches surfed from dawn to dusk camped on rudimentary bunks fished for food and went back out on their boards the next day what a euphoric way to spend your youthful days we see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start what was the biggest boost to the sport believe it or not it was the movie gidget although i suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the beachboys surfing songs like surfer girl and surfing usa the surfing magazine and encyclopedia of surfing who knew there was such a tome are mentioned for their contributions we also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport their families and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s one such story is how 40 year old laird hamilton considered today s greatest surfer bonded with an earlier leading surfer introduced him to his single mom who he married before becoming his step dad a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story have i whetted your appetite wonderful have a great ride 
__label__0  though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of blood there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing acting editing and script writing jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i ve ever seen his descent into the maelström of madness is achingly self aware and clumsy oh look at him twitch oh look at him drink strong spirits oh look at him raise his brow and cock his head at a jaunty angle oh look at his unwashed greasy dark hair oh listen to his affectedly husky voice he must be a tortured artist writer genius oh yes out comes the poet shirt it s another boy who thinks he s byron or poe oh for the love of did someone give this guy a manual on how to act good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere the defunct little plastic toy prize in a discontinued brand of bargain bin cereal okay that was a stupid line but that s only because london s performance has melted my brain with its awfulness katherine heigl is cute and very briar rose but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film she delivered her lines like she was being held up in fact her whole performance was very wooden her poses as stiff as her lines who knows perhaps she was just reacting to and trying to neutralise jeremy london s flailing excesses but if that s the case she takes it too far notable is arie verveen as poe while his character s role is confused he delivers the best performance of the piece he quite simply looks right but it s more than that he has some sort of depth i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two dimensional quality of the rest of the characters huh maybe it s just because i like poe and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen whatever he had an interest factor otherwise missing the rest of the characters are a faceless blur there are all the usual caricatures the perky blonde best friend who s a bit of a floozy the smitten local cop who s a bit of a dork the protective older man who perhaps has too much un fatherly interest in our heroine the scheming old witch etc etc yawn yawn as with the distinct lack of blood for a horror movie issue none of the themes that they mention and that london s character mentions so scathingly in his attack on poe s writing are followed through on as another reviewer said there was potential here murder incest genuinely shocking stuff but instead they skirt away from the issues and cut away from the violence a raised candlestick swinging through the air closing in on it s victim then cut to black this is fine in a noirish traditional horror indeed it s expected and is fondly received when it happens it s a dear convention especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup but in descendant it just comes across as clumsy or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller the horror of palingenesis delusion madness or a simple and fun slasher movie it tries to be both or neither something new and exciting but either way it fails dismally the only horror element of this entire movie is it s epic dullness i think the editor if there was one at all must have been drunk when s he chopped this thing up there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes scenes that appeared to be out of order but that could have just been the poor script likewise the director cinematographer there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning but just ended up looking silly again fine in a noir but this was trying to be something else the whole thing perhaps may have been funny in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned omg how did this get made if i had been in the mood for some trash bagging unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch with the lights down low with the express intention of scaring myself silly this is a very poor film and i m afraid i can t recommend it to people not even for laughs please please don t waste your time or money on this either borrow a real horror thriller film or find yourself a copy of poe s fantastical tales either way you ll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish 
__label__1 i haven t seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a life changing event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days 
__label__1 reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting i even found a site which claimed that bette davis success was probably due to her luck but ms davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart fog over frisco and on human bondage characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different arlene in the former is a beautiful glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than mildred in the latter which is a pale uneducated and impudent cockney waitress needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm but even that is not all the point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play the latter role which seemed to most actresses as undesirable career destroying role was the one she fought for ferociously for months and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing the film which tells about a medical student phillip carey leslie howard which falls unhappily in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers bette davis has a few week points but many more strong ones the story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes for example it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place well there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved nevertheless the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiner s music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters faces in fact the film is amalgamated by phillip s walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two tone repetition every detail is well thought max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in phillip s life which is consistently used through the film and a beautiful scene in which we see sally s face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes i ve ever seen exactly due to francis dee s breathtaking beauty ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind as well as steiner s captivating music camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing but my strongest objection is that events are presented too two dimensionally which induce viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her but they curiously finished portrayed as likable characters after all mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him which he just refuses to hear it is phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem he is enslaved to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life of course selfish and impudent mildred after discovering voluntary phillip s bondage to her did its own share to make his life hell even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen it is less than clear why would she burn phillip s money maugham intended different in his novel after all she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne for modern standards the film is a bit outdated but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark 
__label__0 i cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made there are about four good looking shots the director should think about switching to still photography and that s it a strong cast is utterly wasted scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new please spare yourself this movie 
__label__0 i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20 something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we re supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywood s concept of young america permissive detached promiscuous conceited 
__label__1 although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars frank sinatra gene kelly kathryn grayson and director george sidney a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to sneeze at and in conjunction the line up makes anchors aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws sinatra and kelly are clarence doolittle and joseph brady respectively two navy men as the film begins they re just pulling in to the los angeles area for some much needed leave brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named lola doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears appropriately enough and seeks advice on women from brady in private publicly scriptwriter isobel lennart and sidney have all of the navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other brady promises to help get doolittle hooked up but primarily because doolittle won t leave him alone otherwise a kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the navy he won t give the police any information about who he is or where he lives brady helps and he and doolittle end up taking the boy back home when the boy s guardian susan abbott grayson finally shows up doolittle goes gaga for her brady tries to convince him to forget about her brady just wants to get back to lola but they keep getting coaxed back to abbott s home and eventually something of a love triangle forms things become more complicated when brady lies about doolittle knowing a famous musician jose iturbi who is in residence at a film studio and claims that doolittle has set up an audition for abbott who is a singer and actress in front of iturbi because of the story the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the navy premise obviously broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings opera what abbott s character excels at liberace like popular classical what iturbi did and mexican music because abbott frequents a mexican restaurant in a mexican section of l a the combination doesn t work as well as it could plenty of the songs are good and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence worse there are a couple showcases for iturbi who was apparently a big star at the time that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time i just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music robert altman s kansas city 1996 but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film anchors aweigh takes a similar tactic yes this is a musical but there s a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material there are also some plot problems it s not very well established why brady is so against doolittle s pursuit of abbott we can guess that brady thinks doolittle shouldn t become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid and who seems relatively proper and traditional but on the other hand brady can tell that doolittle doesn t have the same womanizing disposition that brady admits of himself abbott seems like a good fit for doolittle and furthermore lennart works hard to establish that brady just wants to get doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting lola it seems that brady s character should be quickly pawning doolittle off on any candidate whether she s a good fit or not this might seem like a minor detail but it s actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot the story also seems a bit drawn out length is a problem anchors aweigh clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes should have been cut down by at least a half hour the above surely sounds like i m complaining about the film too much to justify an 8 i just wanted to stress what i see as flaws because the conventional wisdom on anchors aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws sinatra kelly and grayson are certainly charismatic separately and together they turn in good interesting performances sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29 30 while shooting he plays an unusually naïve virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later and different than his public image as a crooner for kelly this was his breakthrough film and rightfully so his choreography is varied and impressive as is his acting grayson is charming her performance is sophisticatedly understated and she s simply gorgeous all of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing and there s even a very interesting element that probably only arises because sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous kelly dance with jerry the mouse of tom and jerry fame in an extended fantasy sequence this is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you re a fan of fantasy the fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film matched in excellence to the dance with jerry the mouse is a long song and dance number featuring kelly and grayson where brady is imagining abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony as uneven and flawed as the film is it is largely successful and entertaining to watch fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn t miss anchors aweigh and neither should sinatra fans who ll get quite a kick out of his character 
__label__0 well i m probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i ve seen in a long time we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended yeah ok with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film however the film then continues on for a whole other hour and in this remaining time its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers oh yea and the age old money is the root of all evil blah blah blah just because you know your making an epic film doesn t mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn t even cared about through most of the film oh wait and the film isn t the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery even if they are starving at the time of this idea it still doesn t make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography the land is shot beautifully oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say one last thing i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface also a better film than this of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian the rest are just americans being silly oh and please ms rainer that was a really nice one note performance not if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands oh i would the good earth is one epic waste of time if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets mainly because it wasn t written by a monkey 
__label__1 i kind of consider myself as the 1 fan of hidden frontier seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys well not counting conventions of course i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001 and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self made studio areakt pictures which operates out of the back room of his house while not as fancy as say the tos based series new voyages which sometimes gets some of the actors writers from the original series like walter koenig aka mr chekov rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called enterprise the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek s first openly gay character corey aster who was introduced in the second season and his search to find a soul mate somewhere later in the series he meets jorian zen the excelsior s trill helm officer in the recent story lines with these two characters warning major spoiler do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point zen is joined to an exiled symbiont causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster though the future is uncertain seeing as the most recent episode beachhead was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night i think that this relationship will endure but only time will tell gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason and this is what has made this series as popular as it is as the previous comment stated i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10 but it will have to suffice although next season will be the last keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek the next generation i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode 
__label__1 john candy s performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever it s been my favourite movie since it came out i spent 5 years searching for it that s how good it is if you disagree well that s your opinion enjoy the movie 
__label__1 this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10 
__label__0 i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it from what i remember it s main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man some people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life i will pay u 1 to take this film off my hands oh wait i already gave it away to a friend 
__label__0 although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film and more than once after that the plot development is disjointed and slow the verbal diarrhoea of the main character s only friend is practically insufferable the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying it is typical of ventura pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters however this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from caricias or caresses where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film in amor idiota we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn t support that i won t give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his unwavering attention even though i watched the whole thing i wasn t made to care even for a moment about either of them if you can sit through all this prejudice ignorance betrayal bad dialogue flimsy philosophy etc the camera work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the dogma group the makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst i ve seen cayetana guillen cuervo in any of her movies while in person she is actually attractive i suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then pons has achieved his objective the barrage of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance true that i heard much of the male audience squirm in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes save yourselves and watch something else 
__label__0 this is a story of a jewish dysfunctional family the parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house the father murray abromowitz moves with his children to california and moves around beverly hills so that his children can get the best education possible things really become funny when marisa tomei murray s niece comes to lives with the group the film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood jessica walter costars as a woman who wants murray to move in with her since she wants a companion carl reiner and rita moreno come in towards the end they play murray s brother and sister in law respectively they re also the parents of tomei in front of the children reiner lets loose reminding murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along the film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around beverly hills in their car i guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self esteem 
__label__1 the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march a very good film indeed hollywood s love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once 
__label__0 this is just a bad movie with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek hero fighting almost like jackie chan battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger music almost like in say conan etc almost but in the end it s just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it maybe apart of john rhys davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before mentioned crouching tiger i am really ashamed of poor old john he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else 
__label__0 this is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the united states we are still working on it too however despite the fact this is true it s still a movie and this is a movie site i realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors but wow the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis but even he couldn t make up for all the actors including the one playing him as a young man absolutely atrocious acting granted the script was terribly cliché but even then you have got to get some decent actors i wouldn t recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category read some books about the true story of the u s s mason because they give these men the respect they deserve 
__label__1 a long time ago i watched this movie from the middle on cable i then had a crush on mary moronov i saw her again in eating raoul i was convinced that she s the hottest woman on screen i maybe biased about this movie 9 out of 10 this s the only movie i own on original tape 
__label__1 may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids don t really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner may s husband says he doesn t feel well blames it on his daughter s cooking and irritably says he wants to go home he dies that night may now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her days she is depressed and unmotivated she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mother s arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she lets loose with anger over her mother s lack of nurturing may seems disarmed and surprised yet she also doesn t seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i m your mother and i love you what does really say i ve heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are needy though they show it very differently paula has been involved with a friend of her son s darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son nicky but supposedly doesn t live in the home with his wife may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of may s rationalization that what she is doing is okay at a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may s face as she endures the one time ghastly liaison eventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways sympathies will be divided at one point during paula s writing group may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn t like her having any friends so she didn t have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see may s actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother it is a well done film with more complexities than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions it is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeing one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable 
__label__1 i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 75 80 of this film was hilarious it s mostly because of brad pitt s performance spot on the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all respects i m not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever brutal honest gritty all good words to describe this movie i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early s violence isn t explained it is explained but they thankfully don t have to go into graphic detail to get their point across overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie underrated 
__label__0 koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter in the early ninety s he tried his hand on movies as well but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football wife a tv presenter and program maker i actually did see this in an almost empty theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters clouseau i so regret spending money on it it looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way some people think it s so bad it s funny i am not one of them i just found it an incredible waste of time and money 
__label__1 i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost s image in my mind the next day and the day after that i ve watched it 3 4 times and each time i appreciate it even more the settings are gorgeous the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects the marsh long shots and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss the main hero is so likable and good natured that he is easily sympathized with to the person who complained that there wasn t enough spark in this film i d say that it s because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person it is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life spoilers discussion i especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost he describes the woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what harm had she done to him the other man says you can t go back alone and lends the hero his dog the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief with it s bounding through the house and even into the locked room the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out the woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house this is all in the very beginning another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence watching the funeral as the camera pans to the right the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones the older man won t even look at it but the kids are all yelling and taunting it crreeepy usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific locales or people as has been mentioned the ghost s malevolence and wrath are frightening and i feel it s attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house or perhaps he was marked no matter what by saving the gypsy girl the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really fills the role well i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film and it is reassuring to see others feel the same i can see how people don t quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man whew i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling aaww yeah any other films to recommend thanks

__label__1 i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like however this being said he s made a lot of films and i ve seen just a few in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in the thin red line nolte has a a full range of acting talents when it s necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors when he just emotes through facial hand and body gestures without saying anything having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors by and large have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in had chaplin lived in our times who knows he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen however the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid even with all its surprises of course on the outset it appears preposterous however it is also not impossible consider these for starters a spy at the heart of the third reich he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe america s most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard look at amazon for more details consider history undercover piercing the reich american spies inside nazi germany dvd i saw this here http store aetv com html product index jhtml id 75054 seems to be a history channel production so is the story ridiculous far fetched yes impossible no back to the plot nolte s character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts was it a type of passivity that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part that s a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp but it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin always fantastic is very good in a small role i was really shocked by the ending of the film no i won t spoil it and it made me feel terrible about the choice did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages hard to say but it really jolts nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things it s very entertaining and provoking what great movies should be a bit long but worth it by the way the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers arvo part

__label__1 this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called pvt snafu all of us have imaginations along with fears and what have you and that s what happens here as pvt snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy that s still being done today we lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven t learned this cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan amazing the writer the famous dr suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever nothing hilarious here but it wasn t meant to be you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time
__label__1 this is an amazing film to watch or show young people aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you ll rarely find in other films it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa but without all the romantic fluff the white french people in cameroon are fascinating because they don t even seem to regard the natives as people the whites are all the bosses and they expect black servitude without question however unlike real servants you only once hear any of the whites say thank you and no other regard is given these people again and again it s like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered the central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother aimée and her servant protée although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the white woman never considers protée or the existence of his feelings a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has protée lace up her dress and it s obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this apart from this relationship while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage also interesting is the relationship between protée and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film while they are very close at times he s more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children there is one bizarre white character who seems at times to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing one moment he s doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them something the other whites would never have done and the next he s trying to beat up protée i could only guess as to what motivated him perhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a communist agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites who knows in fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life the context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more the film appeared to begin in the early 1980s since she s wearing a walkman style headset and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about 1960 more or less but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the 1970s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s before the country experienced political change apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea and i also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride but overall it just feels like something is missing there just isn t any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel 
__label__1 just got through watching this version of samhain and even though i still like it it s nothing like the rough cut version i have if you check the message board you ll see an apology from the director for this cut down version 79 minutes and he says he had nothing to do with this r rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending christian really doesn t need to distant himself that much because the basic gore elements still stand up even though highly trimmed down this is a damn shame because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years it still has the porn stars and the inbreds and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen i m just glad i have that rough cut because to me it s a jewel for any gorehounds library christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods and hopefully his next project will be better produced the idiots had a near classic in their hands and screwed it up for everybody samhain may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever and too bad gorehounds didn t get to see what the director intended just so you know what you missed this is my review based upon the work print of samhain the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops there is absolutely no music soundtrack and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog because i think they are meant to be looped in later however most of the movie does have audio with sound affects and when an effect or scene is missing a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed it s exactly as it says a rough cut but the only uncut version of samhain you are ever likely to see reason because the gore is extremely graphic much more than even an nc 17 would allow yes there are a few porn stars but they are just there for the killing and to add a little sugar and spice the story is pretty standard american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods an area that is heavy on folklore involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain or as we call it halloween spooky the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants this is a great gore scene as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff with her crying for help all he sees is her head arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up she has been completely sliced in two this is what i would call extreme gore with entrails blood and severed limbs all over the place we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks except the effects look much more realistic i m going to just skip the story because it s your standard stalk and kill plot the next gore scene is something to behold as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location tcm 2 stuff and bound to a table this geek then cuts all of his limbs off off camera with a cue to insert a scene and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit turning slowly over a fire and the torso has a hard on if you can believe that yes very bad taste gross gruesome you find the right word and it will probably fit too then later jenna jameson her beautiful body and all is cut from neck to crotch and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee and her blood drains into a pot yummy a real turn on huh but the best gore scene happens inside the house and i have to admit this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen this guy doesn t matter who is caught from behind from a geek and cut open at the ass hole the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails intestines and what the hell ever else there is right from his asshole this goes on forever as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor this is so extreme so over the top that i found myself laughing all to hell obviously you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd imo along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes so what to think of all of this well first of all even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation it makes this rough cut a rare jewel for gorehounds yes it s a little difficult at first with no soundtrack a few scenes to still be inserted and credits that have missing names all over the place but that s what makes this so unique and i wouldn t trade it for anything right now extreme gore yes yes extreme extreme gore this makes haute tension look like a disney movie 
__label__0 this was shown as part of the 59th edinburgh international festival though for reasons best left to the powers that be a lot seems to have been made of the fact that it s the first thai language film made with thai actors crew but directed by a westerner needn t have bothered to be honest as this film is dull dull dull why hint at something why shroud an idea in mystery why subtly invoke a feeling when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs obvious shots and over the top scenes nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés no hinting no guessing it s all up on screen no need to use our imaginations wonder when the scary bit is coming no you wont cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating rising to a crescendo of ominously hell i m making up words to describe how bad this is wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary why tax yourself it s really is a snake and yes it s really is biting his crotch and there s blood splattering everywhere it s a strange uneasy film for several reasons it s supposed to be a horror film but it s not scary the jolts are signposted obvious it might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of thailand yet the director has a sleazy lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens maybe it was casting himself as the virginity taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head or maybe the whole thing was just pants uninspired insipid repetitive hackneyed all candidates for best description but dull seems most appropriate and honest it s all been seen before probably better often with more thought rarely with less imagination or flare sorry thumbs down on every count truly dire

__label__0 warning spoilers galore tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho oh that s right some idiot already did that i rest my case movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation proving he s not that smart from the outset marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason interior of ship a bustle with genetic experiments on apes must we travel 1 300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments the special effects team decrees it marky s chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci fi cinema the time warp marky then demonstrates the space station s mind boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep space rescue mission into a worm hole for an expendable test chimp with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies before anyone can say pointless remake marky has surfed the worm hole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it weren t for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees surprise it s apes doing the chasing or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirty three years ago since marky mark did not get to show his pecs take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap he was characterless michael clarke duncan s gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character helena bonham carter aka irritating chimp activist at a loss without a shakespearean script did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout paul giamatti the orangutan slave trader secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes re imagining the apes of roth while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke tim roth as chimpanzee thade chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was his character lacked a behavioral arc thade is mad when we first meet him and he s pretty much at the same level of mad at film s end nice twist the original pota 1968 featured a leading character charlton heston s taylor who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets yet as that film progressed taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind s worth as their sole champion the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky mark s leo or roth s thade no but there s lots of running the slogans cry take back the planet but it s the apes planet in this movie humans and apes crash landed here together the humans having degenerated to cavepeople allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor the apes deserved to inherit the planet along comes marky mark in true anthropocentric arrogance taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators simply because they re there taking it back is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining a planet where men evolved from apes and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was ben hur michelangelo moses to cast him as the mute dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience s expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans it s like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him burton tries to elevate marky to humanity s icon but he comes off as a chittering deviant in the original film the apes deem taylor a deviant yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity that irony again it was apt that a man who elevated scene chewing to an acting technique heston should play the father of this film s primo scene chewer thaddeus roth as roth s ape dad charlton utters his own immortal lines turned against the humans this time damn them damn them all to hell the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end while thaddeus is giving marky an ass beating lesson a pod descends from on high with marky s chimpnaut in it apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering let s teach these monkeys about evolution firstly they re not monkeys you ape secondly it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point not evolution and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy not evolution giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warren s half nekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants no matter that he was humankind s last underpanted hope in the end cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating it s a madhouse a madhouse 
__label__1 either or i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie i have re visited it many times and it always holds up a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it norman jewison a fellow canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is i have often wondered at the paucity of cher s acting roles whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in mask i found the comedic strokes broad at times a hair salon called cinderella but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera all extravagant gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat the brooklyn scenes are magical this is a brooklyn under moonlight romanticized and dramatic just like opera all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone s taste by a long shot i loved the ending everyone brought together like a greek chorus every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking 8 out of 10 
__label__1 it s a lovely movie it deeply reflects the chinese underground bands current lives if you chinese culture traditionaled rock n roll music there you go i will highly recommend this one but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been showed in mainland i sorta doubt it d:D
__label__1 okay this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars but i ve voted for 10 to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo s who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big time hollywood productions performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive with notable turns by bill paxton james karen vivian schilling and brion james martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe lamp and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim but overall it s got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments definitely worth seeing so judge for yourself 
__label__0 as a spiritualist and non christian i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers i thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from atheists and jews and who are all these street people he s interviewing who don t know the back of their arm from their head where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970 personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti christ told me so please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth not your beating off the drums 
__label__0 let s cut to the chase this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the american pie teat period the whole plot and that shouldn t imply that there s a whole lot to go around serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes if you re a tween guy and you re too squeamish to purchase actual pornography then this is the movie for you otherwise the movie doesn t have much to offer at all the acting is sub par the character development is virtually non existent and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity binge drinking and pranks none of which are particularly memorable go buy real porn if that s what you want to see and if not go watch a good movie animal house kids or even the original american pie are all great cinematic works and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity it s not how much it s how you use it 
__label__0 i never finished this movie for a reason it was dreadful and thats just the acting i wasn t even sure what the film was about tbh it didn t make a lot of sense and the violence was awful i mean ususally i like some nude in a film lol but it was just sick because of what was happening all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone or even consider it n 
__label__1 some movies you just know you re going to love from the first few seconds this is one of those movies tracing it s roots back to double indemnity and the postman always rings twice in the 40 s this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90 s nick cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets entangled in a husband wife murder plot and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of red rock west lots of twists and turns great performances by cage hopper and walsh an hypnotic slide guitar musical backdrop and seamless directing make this a real joy favorite line when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get away car shakes his head and says f in story of my life 
__label__1 hello this little film is interesting especially for an artist film maker or music creator or a visual artist for one can feel and examine david s touch style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity you can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots the pans and the sound elements even as simple film this creation is multy layer for example there are some sounds that drone all along while others appear though subtle at certain points to support certain shots one can see also several types of pans some go up and down in a gentle back forth way there is diagonal pan zooms also go back and forth sometimes the lightning and the composition disposition of elements in the space is as usual and obviously work of a painer artist this can be felt even in this crappy room this is to say one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look view and composing the scene then comes the forcelines of the visuals like digonales parallels etc the light s degradées and the colours although without too much research for textures as in big productions are fine too this is an artist s sketch of a sort all this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the david s touch feel to it as with any true artist 
__label__0 some not so spoily spoilers aheadwhy do people when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room how often do you knock on a stranger s door and when they don t immediately answer you open the door walk in shout a few hello s and then start going through their stuff if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer what would you do quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements run quietly of course to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure i could be talking about almost any thriller that s come out in the last few years but since this is the the return page obviously i m talking about the return i saw it free because i work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the scary movies i thought this one was tolerable aside from the well worn clichés sarah michelle gellar is really drab and looks kind of huh through most of the film the details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it s almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn t enough explanation as it moved on and so i was almost lost until the last 2 3 of it if you re a die hard thriller fan it s worth seeing at least once if there s nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie eh i guess it s worth a matinée ticket if you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can t wait wait 
__label__1 8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc the hennessy clan mother cate katey sagal daughters bridget kaley cuoco and kerry amy davidson and son rory martin spanjers look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul john ritter the family patriarch cate s parents james garner and suzanne pleshette lend a hand i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series just shoot me but all and all this show is pretty good this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80 s and 90 s that used to be on abc 
__label__1 i finally watched these episodes in 2008 and i had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of gov bush or they are those weird eerie people that pay attention to things boo scary bush s frat bros invading the white house dressed as arabs wielding rifles bush accidentally executing someone no wait he did sort of do that as gov this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time but must now be considered as brilliant if spooky prescience 
__label__1 a very unique sci fi animated film and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be better or worse this french film is quite interesting to watch the technique part is innovatory like waking life i recently watched it took me quite a long time to get used to the black white style but eventually i love it the sketchlike images are really fancy the contracted future world is a symbol of human race s final destination which i adore it very much the whole plot is fine for a sci fi not so intriguing but it s ok like some hollywood s products a giant conspiracy about human s eternity a little bit cliché and the twisted ending is not so convincing some development is just too plain and insipid and the whole movie is too long so i think i m just in love with the style this film shows others are not so good about the eternity of life i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don t want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking but that s also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one s life and make the world colorful and lively

__label__1 magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades like any really fine film it s a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming i can t believe this film is so difficult to find i d buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet 
__label__1 i caught this movie about 8 years ago and have never had it of my mind surely someone out there will release it on video or hey why not dvd the ford coupe is the star if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away 
__label__1 although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie i am ashamed to say i rather like it not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham video so it is most definitely worth a viewing 0 79 a night in my local store watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster s costume the fact that the hero looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following evil wizard type bloke at last we meet kor kor thrilling isn t it amazing i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety among other such interesting and engaging suggestions of what goes on in the actual film none of them actually happen no i m not joking there really isn t a raging sea or a ferocious bird it s just trying to make you interested classic in my opinion this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value 
__label__1 good luck finding this film to even watch it s not yet released on tape or dvd i saw on release in the early 70 s was lucky enough to catch it via american cinematheque s preservation efforts and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years no reason to repeat rwint s accurate comments here as a come out director soon after the soaring success of five easy pieces jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re cutting but it s also a memorable icon for it s time the all very intense clashes of late 60 s college sports student movements sexual revolution and more why see this film it was probably a ground breaker in some scenes the frisky male bonding in the after game showers karen black s scene with tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard but it s the first use of a word i hadn t witnessed in film before and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall there are probably others i m omitting look for a nice surprise of a young cindy williams in one of her first films a thin david ogend stiers mike warren fresh out of his powder blue ucla uniform and readying for a dark blue tv uniform robert towne actor and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves now any connection between harry gittes last name robert towne and a certain character in chinatown and the two jakes it gets a 7 based on karen black you ll see why 
__label__0 i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade 9 if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know they ve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan he s the man in charge my name s steve paige and i m really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah they re brand new but they re all in their 30 s while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars again the concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think they re all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionally this movie doesn t really document very much either i mean it s basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage it s not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular it s a methodically planned out event so in the end it s rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either 
__label__1 i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users some are saying it s his worst movie ever what haven t any of you seen cradle 2 the grave my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on duh what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action of course not black mask is awesome wall to wall action throughout nearly it s entire running time it s also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people too get slaughtered most of li s other martial arts films are nursery school when compared to black mask there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever and that made me a happy camper again if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons black mask is probably my favorite of his movies though beware of the horrendous dubbing 
__label__0 although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching you better skip this one i watched this one on television so i didn t have to plunk down cash for it lucky me the plot develops slowly very slowly although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end it is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like lt waters would disobey direct orders and even if he would if the rest of his platoon would they know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our lt so let s do what he says despite the direct orders remember still there are some nice scenes in this movie they somewhat save a village where the total population is being massacred by the rebels well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed the strange part of it that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind they rather go on foot maybe because the roads are unsafe but there was no explanation for it anyway i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves only near the end they loose a few comrades and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more can you believe that they fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves and they have rounds and round of ammo never run out of it grenades and claymore mines an m60 machine gun and even an rpg where do they get this stuff carrying it around or what they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days really who think up this crap i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating if not skip this one it saves you time 
__label__1 i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynch s twin peaks a show which i adore the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show probably not through its own fault as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got the acting is excellent and this show has some of the best characters good and evil in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time there is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic but this is rectified as the season progressed well worth a watch definitely something out of the ordinary 
__label__0 this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose cannon if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker this one would have sprung from that it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960 s poor script writing and filming the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver the rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated my advice don t watch it 
__label__0 i don t know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site i m a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief but even if i wasn t the poor acting very poor casting sean astin as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the guy s completely generic and sub standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance sadly it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe you ll like this movie but if you re a vonnegut fan or not completely insane don t see it please 
__label__0 in fact it never was i m not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy what a vacuous shambles none of these people come close to a cary grant spencer tracy katherine hepburn etc and anyway today s audience isn t as receptive to this facile muck writing is trivial the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious the chemistry between the leading characters is non existent it s interesting that julia roberts seems to think she s a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of hollywood whenever that may be it s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride 
__label__0 my favorite memory of this show and the band was when i got together with a bunch of my friends which are nbb haters and had a big bonfire and we took a cd of their songs and the dvd of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing ding dong the witch is dead that was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol god this show sucks i hate it so much get rid of the crappy car you guys really suck you really ruined the whole channel no offence or anything but you guys need to get a life i mean really who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that can t even sing you guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something except roselina she s really pretty but still you guys reak 
__label__0 this movie is an embarrassment to film making i can t believe it was even listed as a comedy not funny not only was the script atrocious but the casting people should be shot gail o grady is just a great actress but beyond that 99 of the rest of the cast ouch pretty much everyone else wow it is hard to even wow here is the number one rule about comedy don t try to be funny there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy none of them were used in this film canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film making in canada i realize this is technically a us film but look at the director actors location etc i just saw this on bravo they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film again there are a lot of great films out there that can t get airtime and they show this crap 
__label__1 maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility she will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation and thus beneath the vicey exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with and then i woke up it is also book ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i ve ever seen but don t let any of that put you off 
__label__0 oh dear lord this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like the actor who played scarecrow was amazing i will say that but this plot was awful it made no sense it had way too much gore and an unnecessary and revolting sex scene at the beginning i do believe the director was trying to be shocking or whatnot but it just came out awful to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot the actors besides scarecrow we re awful and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who in conclusion this movie made me sick if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do 
__label__0 the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters the different story lines don t feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times it may sound weak and cliché but it s true you re way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin it s more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is i m sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn t give us the viewers much pleasure for a comedy it simply isn t funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren t good actors not even when they play themselves their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene s feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times the movie had quite some potential i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when i first heard that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter my first reaction was brilliant the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters the movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still i must certainly wouldn t recommend this movie watching this movie felt like a waste of time still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on tv on a rainy afternoon it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential 4 10
__label__1 huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classic it s immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80 s infinitely better than the american pie s that plague us now there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of 84 three o clock high and the cheesy yet gripping doesn t seem possible river s edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it s the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with it i love you riff randell 10 10
__label__1 i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see it s great 
__label__0 put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1 to 10 star scale bill cosby and ray romano have been at the top in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually with their television series yet each has had no success in big screen offerings this has also been true for other tv personalities perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10 minute skit or at most the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half hour program this film however doesn t have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv snl or anywhere else on a screen or stage its origination date is listed as 2002 but release date to dvd only is shown as 2004 it also was filmed not long before rodney dangerfield s death so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs i d never heard of it but found it when turning on my set and frankly became fascinated by it some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10 plan 9 from outer space is the best example and the bruce jenner village people opus can t stop the music is another unfortunately this flick falls short even there even if rodney s earlier work as well as some of his fellow cast members fell short of citizen kane or casablanca there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest unfortunately this presentation doesn t seem to possess even a minute or two s worth of such material 
__label__0 have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before that happened to me with the young graduates the cover of the video box if you can find the video is extremely deceiving i d swear that the two women on the cover aren t even in the film anyway i was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or it is simply pointless junk i m heavily leaning toward the latter but i guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie hmm plot a plot let s see there must be a plot around here somewhere nope i can t find it it s pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago one of the female students has a crush on her teacher the teacher has a frigid wife whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg so he is receptive to the girl s advances there s a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing our cat booboo was transfixed by the dancing high school kids she watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor it s nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic 1 10
__label__1 i did not have too much interest in watching the flock andrew lau co directed the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called niels mueller i had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study so they fired him and hired another director this usually does not work well let s remember the invasion but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected it s not a great film but it s an interesting and entertaining thriller the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well also the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible richard gere and claire danes bring competent performances now let s go to the negative points one element which really bothered me there was a moment in which it irritated me was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more attitude and style that tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary plus i think the film should have been more ambitious in spite of that i recommend the flock as a good thriller it s not memorable at all but it s entertaining 
__label__1 embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release it s a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit wild the other brother is the typical older child craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up it s a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie 
__label__0 lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii then he quipped the less said about that the better indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter it was a film to be taken seriously like other good original films filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front there is absolutely nothing scary about it it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning okay i ll cede ferdy mayne too lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things check out that ending with him and stirba lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania the story isn t really worth examining here and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise sybil danning is here and yes she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again one reviewer said 17 times i counted ten but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point i gave the film three stars but it really deserves a zero the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms danning s contributions yuck 
__label__1 what a brilliant film i will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter at a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way cry freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid it is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko i may be wrong but although it is biko s story it is told in the perspective of woods so woods is an important character in conveying biko s story to the world cry freedom visually looks amazing with the show stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot george fenton s music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes it was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes the script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the police s attack of the south african citizens or biko s death the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch but is compensated by how it is shot performed and written and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well the performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn t a single bad performance regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in denzel washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as biko and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington s and the two men s chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note penelope wilton is lovely as donald s wife wendy and she is a great actress anyway out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me one was timothy west who relishes his role as captain dewet the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo role as kruger lord richard attenborough s direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual overall a truly wonderful film ambitious and long it is but never ceases to be compelling powerful and achingly moving a definite winner from lord richard attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise 10 10 bethany cox
__label__1  the shop around the corner is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan it s filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart they re the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs in fact the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn t make anymore the makers of you ve got mail claim their film to be a remake but that s just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise anyway if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940 s you ll find the shop around the corner to be nothing short of wonderful just as good with repeat viewings enjoy 
__label__1 i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much too much some have said i have 27 copies on video and i love them all equally i also love anyone else who loves it i love you my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band i hope to call it the knobs love me liz 
__label__0 ok how s this for original this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house what happens that night will surprise only those who haven t seen a movie or television show before after a string of murders in which the victims look like they re bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks there are also a few second tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now as a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of matlock i will give credit where it s due the closing scene is clever and amusing if you re still awake 
__label__0 i ve seen plenty of sci fi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 my first one was sabretooth which actually is one of the more entertaining sci fi channel features in my opinion their quality varies some of them are average but decent sabretooth dragon fighter never cry werewolf swamp devil some are laughably bad and then there are some that are truly terrible raptor planet lies in the latter raptor planet a loose sequel to the 2004 sci fi channel original raptor island is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet are some of the worst looking effects i ve seen in a low budget film the gore effects are even unconvincing the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason i forget why travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs that s right folks the dinosaurs are aliens dinosaurs in outer space what s next sharks in space the rest of the plot is simple the human cast are picked off and eaten by now we ve come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released but this is the first killer dinosaur movie i ve seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks there are a few chuckles in it though there s one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur brought to life by stock footage from the original film that seconds later becomes a giant raptor also a bit of trivia this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie while raptor island wasn t a good film to begin with its a masterpiece compared to its sequel believe me when i say this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired it s darn near unwatchable 
__label__1 this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style that could be termed zany beauty vidor s direction is light but sure handed the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the star watching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a knee jerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude 
__label__1 if you are looking for a sonic boom special effects monster click the back button on your browser deathtrap was written by ira levin sliver the stepford wives rosemary s baby it s a stage play adapted for the screen 95 of the movie takes place in the gorgeous home of playwright sidney bruhl michael caine he s the author of a fabulously successful broadway play but his last 4 efforts have flopped horribly an aspiring playwright clifford anderson christopher reeve who attended a play writing workshop given by sydney has sent him a copy of the play he has written sydney tells his wife myra dyan cannon the play is fabulous a sure fire hit but is it good enough to die for time will tell clever dialog and numerous twists and turns in the plot keep this movie entertaining from beginning to end the whole cast seems to have a good time it s reminiscent of another fun michael caine mystery sleuth worth watching 
__label__1 unfortunately for myself i stumbled onto this show late in it s lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline but most of all the great actors i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget moynahan was the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez from carlito s way rise to power and erika christensen swimfan i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime i m viewing it on abc s website from the beginning 
__label__1 i thought it was an original story very nicely told i think all you people are expecting too much i mean it s just a made for television movie what are you expecting some great wonderful dramtic piece i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie and that s my opinion 
__label__1 the whole point of making this film one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera was to make it more accessible to the masses and it succeeded admirably in doing so the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals a young loren handsome della marra and a slinky ms maxwell who make the story much more believable giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be altogether an enchanting introduction to one of verdi s great works i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera a form with which i was then not well acquainted i still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals luciano della marra was a standout as radames and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films 
__label__1 you re using the imdb you ve given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films it s something you enjoy doing and it s all because of this fifty seconds one world ends another begins how can it not be given a ten i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight exactly how could the first film ever made be better for the record the long still opening shot is great showmanship a superb innovation perfectly suited to the situation and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch all this within fifty seconds the word genius is often overused this is genius 
__label__1 many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first well maybe it isn t to you however how does your child react to it well mine loved it more than the first disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids for example bambi s mother getting shot this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings if you want to be snobby about what should be disney s standards based on the past skip this movie if you have a sweet little girl or soft hearted little boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your small children this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares i m happy with a movie that pleases my kid doesn t need to impress the parents all the time 
__label__0 i m a huge randolph scott fan but this film is a dud the whole thing has a canned fake soundstage feel to it with truly awful rear screen projection it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters the directing is pedestrian and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it i ve seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage productions before but this is not one of them all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott boetticher films all the more randolph scott is tanned trim and shines that million dollar smile throughout he s always a pleasure even in the worst of his films aside from scott the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms wymore in errol flynn s movie rocky mountian in man behind the gun she is just as beautiful and you can tell she s a good actress but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful i ve only seen phil carey in operation pacific and he plays the exact same character here an arrogant pain in the butt you want to beat into unconsciousness i guess it proves he s a good actor he made me hate him there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film in my opinion although there are many elements to knock i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbers but that s not why we go to see randolph scott movies right there are definitely worse scott films out there and this one certainly isn t unbearable but it also certainly couldn t be deemed anything beyond mediocre 
__label__0 this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor connery s charisma and screen presence are the film s only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous 2 10 avoid it 
__label__1 one of the best amitabh comeback movies i liked this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan the songs were awesome and totally as we call it masti type an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david dhawan s potboilers with a timely appearance by mrs madhuri nene dixit it was a total riot towards the end it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile although some may consider it a typical bollywood masala movie i would watch it any day i am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure bollywood 
__label__0 even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn t join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone s 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right 
__label__0 skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone skullduggery simply isn t a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can t make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching a muddled disorganised movie an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued this was a very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and that s just not the right idea we re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn t do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless 
__label__1 this is a brilliant sci fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots but whatever the cause i have always found this difference fascinating the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been assassinated as the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future american society the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy including furniture a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment at the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discuss it could ruin the film for you however the film has a great plot and acting and is super exciting to watch plus it features edward g robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to heston though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great sci fi film that is allegorical and profound 
__label__1 one of the most heart warming foreign films i ve ever seen the young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her doggie the old man the king of masks and liang the living boddhisatva spoiler the deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing loved the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story this is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version 
__label__1 i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was funny sexy painful and warm andie macdowell s performance was nuanced and vulnerable for once the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life imelda stalinson who has been a mvp in so many british films does a great job in this there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writing the film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track 
__label__0 the film must have been shot in a day there are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red pointer even the scenery s green light that blends with the actors the plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest inspiration at least as a thriller genre movie everything that got to do with poe in the movie has a shallow and childish approach the film is full of clise and no thrilling if you want to watch a funny b movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it as i did but there s no way to take this film seriously 
__label__1 the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie this is a great movie there is no special agency involved in the plot this is the clue this is a private plot built as a private enterprise this is a self destructive and a self organized plot as a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot private self organized self destructive with no trace at the end anyone can be behind the plot a smart director with some money all can be done just by delegation the director must be just trigger if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered all the actors performances are well done with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney 
__label__0 this movie was boring yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that the characters are too stereotyped there is no real story but short episodes with freaky side characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in hungary a mystery why they took the roles this is not a new hope for the hungarian film it was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique they could have tried much more harder than this 2 out of 10
__label__0 not as bad as you ve heard there are actually some funny parts and affleck and applegate have fairly good chemistry applegate in particular is appealing and likable as affleck s love interest james gandolfini and catherine o hara are consummate professionals they re pretty good in just about everything in the end surviving is not the worst holiday movie you ll ever see unfortunately it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced the attempts at dark humor come off as dour affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed his character s cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and o hara s more muted believable performances even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies you never fully buy into the set up of affleck renting this family for x mas there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness the x mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor a son being discovered looking at naked provocative pictures of his mother that not only isn t funny or believable but disturbing to make matters worse the colors in this film are muddy almost noirish the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds paycheck gigli jersey girl and this for affleck it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be 
__label__1 a comedy gem lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing uncontrollably the characters are recognisable and the dialogue well observed i know people like this the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an ealing comedy it s a quirky little film with lots of detail it certainly takes a number of viewings i ve watched it a few times i ve been showing all my friends and notice something new each time a bit of dialogue something visual that i hadn t picked up on before i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i m not going to because overall this is a great fun feel good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy it is a film which will find it s friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack 
__label__0 i have nothing against a fast paced fright flick but this stephen king derived nonsense is too freshly scrubbed too bright and modern the plot about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a sleepwalker sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf and who feeds on the blood of female virgins begs for a more mysterious ambiguous treatment this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice kridge as the boy s mother kridge from ghost story never broke out of the filler female mold and it s a huge loss that she hasn t been used more her performance is creepy and intense and gives hint that sleepwalkers might ve been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction it s too over the top and commercially driven with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama stephen king pops up in a cameo as do real life directors john landis and tobe hooper 1 2 from 
__label__0 richard dreyfuss is indeed in this flick but in a rather small part he is not the obsessed filmmaker he s the group s business manager accountant even the box describes the film inaccurately there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke as advertised unless one uses the term erotic quite loosely i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character i might have however had i realized that the famous 60 s anthem leonard cohen s suzanne was an artistic influence other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of james joyce s ulysses and an interesting visual reference to the end of ingmar bergman s the seventh seal i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like last year at marianbad and un chien andalou if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe there are many superior films ranging from bye bye brasil to cecil b demented 
__label__0 i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie granted it s shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during character s interacting it s nearly difficult to distinguish who s lines are who s granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they could ve obtained voice actors which could ve added a bit more drama to these classic literary lines it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 although perhaps that s based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still it s absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 1 10
__label__0 i view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and i can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst i have seen this year if not ever however i have not actually seen quest of the delta knights yet this movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because i had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip i couldn t walk out do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle the four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by jerry bruckheimer 
__label__0 i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle re enactment but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l h bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there s a reasonably good supporting cast i enjoyed it 
__label__1 as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted as an 11 year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream i thought hmmmm if girls like them they must be crap my only records until then were haley mills the everly brothers ricky nelson soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song which i later learned was love me do and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then when i heard the meet the beatles album of my older brother i was hooked for life having read the definitive book of their beginnings by davis i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use it did touch on the use of methadrine dexadrine 
__label__1 i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie this movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen the movie follows the exploits of a rap group nwh ni rs with hats it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it s tragic break up following the group is documentary maker nina blackburn the movie is on a shoestring budget but it does not seem to matter this is a very well made well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent the main strength of this movie is the writing there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie it is unreal spoilerthere are takeoffs on actual rappers like mc slammer vanilla sherbert ice cold tone def tastey taste and songs booty juice grab your dick etc rusty condieff has made an excellent film in the movie he plays rapper ice cold the movie does not quit it is funny from the beginning to the end the movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie like tone def telling a record producer when you take the bus you get there and the producer responding that s deep the group portraying n w h has some sort of natural chemistry to them they work so well together and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film what really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is many rap groups had problems with violence with censors and like nwa the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics i like this movie because it is offensive there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way the movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap the funniest being of spike lee where they came up with this dialogue i cannot imagine the movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor as i said before the writing is just excellent i am not surprised that this movie met such limited release it is an intelligent controversial and even thought provoking film this is too much for mainstream despite the fact it is hilarious and nearly flawless in it s production there are no major stars but a lot of familiar faces including marc lawrence who plays tone def watch this movie at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it 
__label__1 hard to imagine this film is based on a true story and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring daniel day lewis is a chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing christy is not despised by the normals his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes one important factor of christy s success is his mother s support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make christy s dream come true so lucky for christy and hugh o conor is also excellent as young christy what a performance for a child the love story of christy is very well done trustful christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr eileen cole surprisingly played by fiona shaw i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the loathsome aunt petunia so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is paranoiac and offensive i do have sympathy for him love is a two edged sword happiness and agony are just next to each other btw jim sheridan s works are all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die trying god knows why he chose to direct that crap really a career taint for him what a pity 
__label__1 it was once suggested by pauline kael never a fan that cassavetes thought not like a director but like an actor what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further to me it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation like orson welles cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles but far more important as a true artist as opposed to a technician or rhetorician this is like a cross between italian passion though cassavetes was actually greek and scandinavian introversion never before have inner demons been so exposed physically it s about the mystery of becoming performing and acting like a haunted skip james record it s got the echoes of ghosts all around rowlands breakdowns which are stupefying and almost operatic surprising coming from cassavetes are accompanied by a jumpy unsettling piano who is this dead girl the metaphysical possibilities are endless and it s amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film just the overt display of intelligence there is also a brief bit of voice over at the beginning but then he always was intelligent he just never flapped it around for easy praise this is not adaptation here the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates there s so much going on the pure joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman the horror when she beats herself up the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone you can see some roots of this in a star is born and almodovar borrowed from it for all about my mother i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening you can shoot me but i think the alcoholism despite its urgency in many of the scenes is a relatively small point about the film it s a living breathing thing and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time like taste of cherry we are reminded that you must never forget this is only a play yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line is it great drama how will the audience take it is she being reflexive or does she just not care her character s breakdowns are incorporated into the performances and ultimately the film in such a way that it s like witnessing a female james dean 10 10
__label__0 maybe i m really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman that s me schultz lordy lordy what i would give to see the light firstly that phil silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled you ll never get rich 1955 59 could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt bilko it is very hard to picture any other actor comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant s stripes such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like clayton more the lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle croc s block one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950 s tv screen to the 1990 s movie going public is our collective memory without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apart so as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let s consider some other points right here today the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years furthermore i ve enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko 96 co stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others alumni of nbc s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing but a bilko re make it just didn t click perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked em but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me so we ve already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what s next howse about somebody doing hal roach s world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday ames and tv s 1st cartoon series crusader rabbit remember where you heard it first poodle schnitz 
__label__1 has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other s lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and can t get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including you ve got mail the recent update of shop they re not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch s rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of 
__label__1 rudy does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to dolemite this entry is filled with the requisite rudy ray moore raunch humor and martial arts rudy eludes a crazy red neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where rudy dives down a steep hill see it for laughs and for a brain blasting hit of blaxploitation magic 
__label__0 this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia recieves nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when surprise she isn t what she appears to be the story is fairly predictible and chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying kidman is actualy rather good in this role making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting grade c
__label__0 bingo is the game bullshit is the name rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown up hodgepodge of half baked conspiracy theories puritan prudery and new age gibberish the bulk of the story is set at viciente a cristian resort in the peruvian jungle think tolkien s rivendell meets star trek s planet baku inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow minded cult of love and peace thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design the rainbow colored visualization of the mysterious all healing energy is particularly hideous the celestine prophecies looks and feels like a discarded 1980s twilight zone episode factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound i can t believe hector elizondo agreed to be a part of this maybe it was made without his consent bowfinger style may the lord have mercy on the director the screenwriter the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book 
__label__0 if movies like ghoulies rip off gremlins then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghoulies these barely animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies which involve basically groteque characters sex dreams oh joy but what that has to do with anything is anybody s guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica they show this down in the 8th circle of hell one suspects there s no real plot just goblins kill and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience 
__label__1 de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé who also adapted this story for the screen some really top class acting not only by van huêt but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must see especially if you liked spoorloos the vanishing s original screen adaptation 
__label__0 i m glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read allende s book and get the full story pros the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently to the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good jobs cons this is the worst acting job i ve ever seen from jeremy irons i kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth and i hate the terribly english way he says transito winona ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end i m very curious now whether this movie is typical of bille august s work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent smilla s sense of snow 
__label__1 this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola but less of the magic of veronica voss the political musings have point to them we see the shortages after the war how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day to day life delicious moment when fassbinder playing a grifter tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla who remarks that burning books don t provide much warmth she really wants firewood there s some clumsiness in the first hour the scene in maria s room with the black soldier interrupted by hermann s appearance should go quicker the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi i cringed it was so bad but as the story develops and the years go by i was drawn more and more into this glossy cold world 
__label__1 one of the best musicals ever made this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent rather than for what people might expect the lighting and set are unique giving it a very interesting effect this has a special name that i cannot think of the dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used the movie is well paced beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish a real joy is the music such an array of first rate songs from beginning to end that are perfectly performed and orchestrated also the music is very original and very memorable and i think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties it certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals that might have only two or three not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it 
__label__1 before the devil knows you re dead starts off promisingly setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in rashomon style at around the hour mark sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually morphs into a multi faceted family drama exploring the full realm of human emotions relations as the story comes to its chilling climax as is the case with lumet he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star studded cast without any notion of over acting or hyperbole philip seymour hoffman in one of his best roles is a complex mysterious and interesting character and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke who plays his brother hank that s not to say that hawke is not bad in fact he is quite above adequate in a troubled role that suits his style marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this albert finney s character andy and hank s father is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserved a bit more screen time amy ryan also performs her job adequately before the devil knows you re dead is not an exceptional movie but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the apparent twilight of an illustrious career many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here not least of which involves the use of his characters infused with a killer script no pun intended smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score before the devil knows you re dead is a must see a truly underrated gem 8 10 3 stars out of 4 should just enter my top 250 at 248 highly recommended 
__label__0 another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930 s resurrected by the magic of dvd starring stock universal player lionel atwill often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket one kills the victims stockbrokers involved in a scam and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proved innocent because he could not have spoken to witnesses of course where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness wouldn t they both be deaf oh well atwill does a pretty good job here faking being deaf and mute unfortunately no one else here can really act worth a darn 
__label__0 after leaving tv s popular the andy griffith show don knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matinée pleasing comedy vehicles unfortunately the reluctant astronaut filmed on the cheap as were most of knotts movies is much worse than his others don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to astronaut training camp but not as a candidate for space travel they want him as their new janitor some may say the weak satire capitalizes on americans then fresh fever for the new age of technology but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied it gets off to a good start with an ok set up and nostalgic locations but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic from 
__label__0 this show is possibly the biggest ugliest most generic steam pile i ve seen in children s programming that s actually become successful the lead character johnny while i understand he s supposed to represent an ordinary kid isn t likable or even tolerable the jokes are lame overdone i e the whoa didn t see that coming gag come on that wasn t even funny the first time it s not even cute and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration and lastly it s just plain ugly to look at while kids aren t especially critical of artistic talent they still prefer eye candy i can t stand watching the show because in a way the art style is just gross hideous in fact just plain crummy i just can t stand that this is getting so much airtime while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldn t be getting my hopes up on it coming back i really miss the old cartoons bring back dexter s laboratory the powerpuff girls anything but this crap i guess it s just wishful thinking though simply put i advise you don t waste your time on this show i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids too and this doesn t cut it

__label__0 i sat glued to the screen riveted yawning yet keeping an attentive eye i waited for the next awful special effect or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force so i could learn how not to make a movie it seems when they set out to make this movie the crew watched every single other action science fiction shoot em up good vs evil movie ever made and saw cool things and said hey we can do that for example the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking is the one car the protagonist an attractive brunette born of bile is thrown on to the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it the special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie but what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility and lack of reason for so many elements for example the antagonist a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important vip nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck you know they are already dead then the guy protecting the vip says under no circumstances do you leave this truck do you understand me he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion then for no apparent reason defying logic convention and common sense the dumb ass vip gets out of the truck a lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn t make sense transparent acting distanced me from the movie as well as bad camera work and things that just make you go wow that s incredibly cheesy shiri appleby saved the movie from a 1 because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience sex appeal 
__label__1 i ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so let s focus on the movie and the message i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10 i like pop rock music i m 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didn t recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any self promotion i watch movies to be entertained i don t care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain me i watched this movie for the message the world s greatest epidemic is low self esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don t give up message so yeh it was a bit predictable great message though should be more of them this movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal 
__label__0 this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it s got george lucas behind it and it has the words star and wars in its title that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit this is a travesty first things first the story anakin s evolution there is none apart from a little make up around the eyes and a little yelling there is none he becomes young stupid cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence how good he was at almost everything he did planning fighting you name it the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith unacceptable the fight scenes used too many digital doubles everyone s flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make believe doll house count dooku emperor palpatine anakin obi wan almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around in one specific fight scene obi wan and anakin in the climactic battle they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart i realize the fights are choreographed but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust the writing was awful all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines but that just wasn t enough i can t say enough bad things about this film too much special effects plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe and absolutely no insights into any of the characters this is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered we know the rough picture of everything all lucas did was colour it in we knew anakin lost his limbs we knew luke and leia are brother and sister we knew luke is anakin s son we knew obi wan and yoda go to exile we knew everything nothing new is offered in this film if that s all the fans wanted then that s fine lucas couldn t have gone wrong but when anakin finally becomes darth vader and he asks after padme and hears she is dead he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams nooooooooooooooooooooo that scene screamed b movie all the way and i was half expecting darth vader to go danger will robinson danger at any time that is what this is a b movie disguised by a huge budget and a ultra loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth 
__label__0 the strange people living in a town go about their lives there s the licker a guy who licks everything a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways offbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color the monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel like a troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time not always but enough for it not to be fun though i didn t see the cleansing coming worth a shot if you ve nothing else to watch and you re waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix 
__label__0 if you haven t seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don t waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money spoilers i can t decide which was worse the movie itself or baldwin s hairstyle ellen pompeo s acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers give me a break there s only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than ocean s 12 s which was as meaningless and over the top as this one 
__label__1 standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carter s bland character sparkle whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by curis mayfield must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values i m guessing all in all its worth a gander 
__label__1 kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film the grittiness lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there i was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film ie newspapers letters etc it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn t feel the urge to fast forward once personally i thought all the principles did a tremendous job it was great to see bosworth and kudrow in such difficult roles it made me want to cry at times val kilmer didn t surprise me his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe overall this is a brilliant film not to be missed

__label__1 this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i don t know why they called it return to boggy creek as if it s a sequel this movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid yes it s very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8 12 y o group which it targeted it s harmless g rated kiddie fare and at least you don t have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it strictly for the 8 12 y o set older kids will get bored and think it lame 
__label__0  i just viewed this movie last night and i don t think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stick in the back of my mind the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie i think of a few good men which is a good thing now every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson i will think of tinseltown which is a very bad thing i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman i thought that it at least wouldn t be bad you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling indiana where exactly but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie wrong this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes the characters are paper thin you almost care about none of the characters and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them okay the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves so they figure so does the audience they don t even think about character development except for trying to tie there story back to gilligan s island the plot is unoriginal two guys live in a storage center where one of them stores a bed and there are about twenty other people living there too the rest of the story is contrived and stupid have you seen national lampoon s favorite deadly sins the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who can t find a good story to make a tv movie about so he creates one now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age and take away the comedy and you have this movie the actors try kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie she is still hot but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos as for everyone else i don t think it was the actors fault because they have bad materialgo watch the national lampoon s movie but stay away from this movie 
__label__0 i have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first it was awful i actually didn t watch the end of it it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one all soaps are crap the actors were poor and storyline was bad the person who rated it 10 10 has no idea what he is on about the script was awful 2 people was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no he says if you do that i will hurt you hahahahaha if comedy is your thing watch away please do not watch this film because it s crap summary poor acting bad fights bad script don t watch of course this is in my opinion 
__label__0 i can t quite say that jerry springer ringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film i ve ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe i m not supposed to care about them maybe i m supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isn t the humor is not outrageous it s innocuous it s predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter s boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springer s show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay s obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springer s pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bed sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on 12 000 a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much he d give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work you d think he d have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesn t even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that

__label__1 picking up right after the moscow showdown of supremacy this is bourne s greatest adventure and his final climax throughout the tight 115 min runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid paris marocco and ultimately new york damon is every inch of the hard trained killer robert ludlum imagined he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now and it s the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable and it s exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar opposites of himself that s so breathtaking in this third bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it ultimatum delivers such an high octane performance that you ll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull offs just look out for two great car chases and a fight scene as realistic as bond vs shaw back in 63 director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get a true pay off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy thriller standard 
__label__1 a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy vulnerable loving mother who may or may not be what she seems the story is very tongue in cheek and the dialog skillfully understated hints of humor and intrigue neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well the supporting cast is stellar the downside this film needs your full attention almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body she s worth your time even if you don t understand the denouement 
__label__1 i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now i must really love it right well not really i was a surfer earlier in my life and i loved the sport to this day i am fascinated by good surfing riding giants has plenty of that and thus i am a sucker for the thing but i definitely have some bones to pick with it peralta you listening first the movie has too little faith in its subject matter the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined very very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic cut and pace method it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california not a single wave is ridden start to finish almost the entire section on mavericks one third of the movie is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop but he goes way too far mavericks is not just a bad acid trip waves are actually ridden there even with great performances it would have been good to see some of them if peralta thinks this is a grand sport and i am sure he does then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much at times the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii which i still cannot understand even if i run it on slow motion on dvd the image is too fast to be decipherable it must be a couple of frames in length at the max second have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors version on dvd these guys sound like two over the top valley girls the same sentiment shows up in the main production every thing is always so goddamn amazing etc one character in particular is just plain obnoxious sam george the editor of surfer magazine who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say he is a super drag on the movie there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie i mean just to get the old movie shots they have and also all of the interviews the movie is a great story and i think it is generally captivating entertainment thematically it is well laid out with the three parts centering around greg noll jeff clark and laird hamilton respectively there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal in the directors narration they say it is a new type of 3d technology and it really works the three principle characters shine both in their interviews and in the water as an athlete laird hamilton is a revelation he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball and too the story of his meeting his father is a gem it really touched me it is just that the movie could have been so much more the very last part of the movie when the credits roll gives a hint of what it could have been there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish though you may like it if you are fan of the modern frenetic school of rock anyway there s my two cents 
__label__1 half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in finland these stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard this indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time the film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key the film improves so stick with it two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief the last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving while the various scenes of family life take place in finland the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90 minute drama 
__label__0 a chemical spill is turning people into zombies it s up to two doctor s to survive the epidemic it s an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word crap wouldn t fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is but i don t know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in summation this movie sucks balls don t watch it my grade f
__label__0 if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide avoid it like the plague a steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn t begin to describe how bad this movie is there is only one funny scene the memory eraser scene but even that rates only 001 on the laughometer out of 1000 whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives 
__label__0 no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in trouble it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really isn t anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a point boring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette aren t enough to save this film 
__label__1 do you like really inventive comedy or do you love the wedding crashers if the answer is the latter stop reading now i can t believe this movie is not higher rated basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin powers there are so many inventive moments in this gagorama from crudity leon playing with himself on the porch the ex boyfriend tricked into eating oh well to inspired lunacy clown sex the broadway routine the voice over meadows is great as the childish but very sweet natured leon some great lines don t blame the wang freaky deaky sex world too many why this movie wasn t huge is a mystery great comedy 
__label__1 the performances in this movie were fantastic the dialogue was great jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as kid collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel far superior to the grifters which was a good movie this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction film noir roots from which the story came i recommend this movie to all film noir fans 
__label__0 if this is supposed to be the black experience let me out at either the front or back door a mama s boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it s all down hill for him angela bassett the one shining grace in this film plays his over protective religious mother despite her anger at how his life has turned by the middle of the picture she really decides to accept this she allows his friends to come in and suddenly it s all right to use the profanity as long as it s not in front of the children this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap you knew where this film was heading i literally laughed out loud when at the end when bassett is accompanying her son s body for burial she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24 he had become a man what man he had been a convicted criminal wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity and scorned society that scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher the east coast west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained all we see are guns blazing a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music the african american community should take umbrage at their very being who was this classless fat slob who portrayed biggie he made rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison i know it was the streets of bedford stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment 
__label__1 deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesn t make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you can t catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching 
__label__0 i have to admit that over her dead body actually wasn t as bad as i was expecting my mom wanted to see it so i rented it i figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes but actually this wasn t too bad i was just expecting this horrific movie but it seems like the writers meant no harm but the casting of eva longoria parker sorry she seems a little off set for the movie i think i may have found it to be a little better without her just she does annoy me but paul rudd and lake bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable but you have to admit there was no point to this movie it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing the movie could ve been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast henry just lost his bride to be kate who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day but when his sister takes him to a psychic ashley henry falls for her but kate is haunting her from beyond the grave kate is jealous and doesn t want henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that ashley doesn t get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles believe me with kate s voice that s scary over her dead body is an alright movie not sure if it s worth the money but i d give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious eva longoria just doesn t have enough star power to make the film work no offense to those who love her she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen not to mention the character of ashley she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls or her gay friend dan just again not really likable just with some re writing and proper attention this film could have been better but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling 4 10
__label__0  through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze a not particularly talented director has helmed a not particularly good movie yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits if for nothing more than to see what happens next a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame after capturing her even though she came willingly and threatening her into having sex another event she was also willing to do he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past he then decides to kill her huh but is foiled and dies instead the girl s mind snaps or something like that and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement alright the writing sucks it s long winded loaded with ten cent words and there is way too much of it the acting sucks what a minute what acting the filming sucks home video is bad enough but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult and the budget is a joke get it budget that was the punchline and yet there was a charm to the thing back in the 70 s these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them not in this day and age though if you want to watch this kind of violent sexually exploitive trash don t lie some of us do then this is all your gonna get nowadays some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene torture with fecal material fun with axes anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu it s not good and it won t be remembered but not since the heyday of joe d amato have people made movies like this 4 10
__label__0 the only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three the story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave but for any wave at all j c sean pertwee is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend chloe catherine zeta jones just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the bone yard the trouble is there are no waves until the very end of the film so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings the acting is mostly mediocre sean pertwee has a few comical moments but mostly his acting was mundane ewan mcgregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch probably the funniest performance was turned in by peter gunn as terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag catherine zeta jones was sexy as usual but her character didn t really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability there is really not much here on which to comment i rated it a 3 10 it s a real beach bummer 
__label__0 i had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was positioned as some cross between an aids related story and some kind of ghost blithe spirit tale this film can t always make it s mind up what it wants to be simon and mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship simon is able to have anonymous though safe sex on the side when he wants mark is hiv and he and simon don t seem to have a sex life anymore when mark dies simon who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor not that his behavior before mark s death was much different but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings unfortunately simon is such a selfish sob it s impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it s too late to care mark on the other hand follows in demi moore s footsteps from ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the tv show bewitched but that doesn t last long once simon s emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings the finale with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened grief stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isn t intentionally funny 
__label__0 this is almost the worst film you will ever see 2012 doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars belief but you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie 
__label__1 well this is an ivan reitman film with the rare exception ivan likes to entertain his films generally aren t deep but they are often entertaining enough my super ex girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so grand and i love her portrayals i like luke wilson too and rainn wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isn t very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before it s a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a headache and don t want to strain your brain it s escapist fun and there s nothing wrong with that when you strip away the super girl stuff you re left with a story about relationships and relationships gone bad it s a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love not all of them take being dumped as well as they could a slice of life with a twist 
__label__0 i have seen bad movies before but this one takes the worst movie of a lifetime award by far anthony hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one anywhere i will never see another movie with him in it directing it etc etc i can t believe the other actors actresses that i liked in this picture that stooped so low to be a part of this disaster there must be some great drugs out there for anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film is beyond me save your money on this one huge flop from beginning to end shame on you mr hopkins also shame on christian slater i can t believe you put your reputations on the line for this one 
__label__0 a spoiler what three words can guarantee you a terrible film cheap canadian production the brain fits those words perfectly terrible script idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every bad movie fan the horror is hilarious the post production team looks like it gave up what makes the brain admirable is in the second half it actually tries to be good can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke it s around christmas time a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever the day later a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis if a cop s head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it who would you believe what begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when the brain tries to be serious a child cannot be frightened by the scary moments the brain is too funny a concept to try and be gritty the psychological research institute is larger than major manufacturing plants our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen viewer discretion advised heavily 
__label__0 ok the box looks promising whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting then you pop this baby in the dvd player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes supposed to be a comedy and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending this movie has the following elements a battered and abused next door neighbor a boring legal trial racisim talk of lynchings and death and arson hilarious huh no please if you never listen to anyone s reviews please do here you cannot even force yourself to watch this crap crap i said it crap whoever put there name on this should indeed sue 
__label__1 after just having watched the deer hunter which is a masterpiece the movie jacknife had big shoes to fill it has same themes as the deer hunter the devastating effects on a person after the vietnam war robert de niro is in this film as in the deer hunter and is very good here as is kathy baker but this movie belongs to ed harris who gives a powerful emotional and impactful performance the movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play that was not that big a deal and doesn t really diminish the film i actually really liked this movie it s not an epic like the deer hunter they are about similar era and have similar themes but they are two very different films i thought the deer hunter was great and i also think this movie was great it s the acting in this one that makes it so great for me jacknife is a 10 10
__label__0 how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy i never did see the reason for a remake not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough what s the purpose of this film but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch i mean he s a great comedic actor but him as the grinch it just didn t make any sense to me his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable the whole story of the grinch and cindy lou who was over done and wasn t needed they actually just destroyed the story period all the who s in whoville are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly but cindy lou who is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that he s not going to get as good of a christmas as the other who s he kicks her out and decides that he doesn t want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the who s what his version of christmas is all about but soon he realizes that the who s may know that it s a little bit more than what is the materialized version of christmas how the grinch stole christmas wasn t needed and was a bit over the top i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version at least in my opinion the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done not to mention that how the grinch stole christmas was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmas 1 10

__label__0 this tv production of 1970 starring susannah york and george c scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt jane eyre to the screen and how much can go wrong in doing so it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence but even if the editing were better the film would not be the script is bad the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte brontë s novel at all the problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out this is the case with all the short adaptations but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone the spirit the atmosphere and the concept of the novel this jane eyre for example completely leaves out gateshead and begins with jane s arrival at lowood while this is perfectly all right since some scenes must by necessity be left out it is not understandable that instead of using the time gained so to speak and thoroughly portraying jane s friendship with helen the influence helen has for jane s development the lecture in christian stoicism that she teaches her the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill treatment of helen which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel but here miss scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward who deliberately wants to drive helen to a premature death and this is about all which happens at lowood if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in lowood have on jane in the novel one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in jane s life and this is the problem throughout this adaptation it rushes from scene to scene very often without transition and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel the dialogues are an odd mixture of made up lines and lines from the novel very clumsily patched together and the scenes between jane and rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel but the scriptwriter not only did brontë s language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral set up with just one sentence when rochester and jane go to see rochester s wife after the would be wedding rochester says yet i once loved her his wife as i love you now the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved and that his effort to seek a true life partner is if not sanctified by god s and man s law yet understandable and forgivable but this one sentence completely undermines brontë s whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely blonde blue eyed and full mouthed susannah york as the novel s plain heroine in addition ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it played by her the novel s shy reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly poised graceful and mature woman completely sure of herself and her deserts i do not say that susannah york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not brontë s jane eyre to cast george c scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70 to compliment the maturity of the leading actors all passion desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding the emotional climax of the novel has become a calm rational conversation between two middle aged persons at the end of which rochester falls asleep when jane returns to him in the last scene he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old people s home by his favourite granddaughter the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st john of all people ian bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for jane s love is so touching that one gets the impression that bannen was modelling his st john on the rochester of the novel but good though bannen is his st john is just as far from the novel as york s jane and scott s rochester the only redeeming features of this very disappointing jane eyre are the locations and the score and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of jane eyre 
__label__0 i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger and i thought he was great but this movie was really bad i don t know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula with style looks attraction and the evil underneath that or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension then this is a movie for you otherwise don t see it i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid and i think that sums up the whole thing or maybe you like this film because of it s place in dracula cinema history perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today cause as movie it isn t that appealing it doesn t pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it the scenery looks like cheap theatre and i don t say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies cause i can love old film as well as new 
__label__1  the grudge is a remake of shimizu s own series of popular japanese horror films shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride he uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives at the end all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience the same way a comedy is to make people laugh this movie succeeded with flying colors i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one it probably doesn t play as well in your living room 
__label__0 what a great actor to have in such an awful story the film and its production however is quite good even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol no matter see one cathedral you ve seen em all sort of the story however is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything should he so wish with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy a teenager and finally as a man so much so in fact that he exacts vengeance at will literally over time he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot just by thinking about it the trouble with the narrative however is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi religious claptrap to produce a hodge podge theory about it all mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works and i m afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing his very best scene however is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp witty and deadly dialog delivered as only burton could a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better though beginning with lino ventura whom i last saw in garde a vu 1981 as inspector brunel harry andrews as assistant commissioner the much under rated lee remick as dr zonfeld derek jacobi as a publisher towney and a few other well known character actors i liked the way the story was presented as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar richard burton the writer with the killer disposition up till that point it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick still it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would be murderer then they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes if you want a clue about what that is think samson and delilah 1949 from the illustrious cecil b de mille and how samson got the bad guys in the end and the very last scene is just plain stupid why because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar s rampaging could have been stopped absolutely shame actually because this could have been a lot better story and movie i guess burton really needed the money if you re burton fan then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above otherwise don t bother 
__label__0 having just seen this on tmc it s fresh in my mind it s obvious that while the stooges are featured stars they don t really run the show first they re broken into 2 groups moe as shorty and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants so there s not a whole lot of full team work the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability there s another group of musical stooges that are unfunny unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish the music is tiresome they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses the dorky western wear is silly and there s an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera by the way this is obviously after curley s first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role i loved everything these guys ever did including all the non curley stuff but this little dogie is pretty lousy 
__label__1 i hadn t laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was definetely fresh and witty if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i don t want to ruin the movie for you but i m sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place that s why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men it could easily be a 7 rated movie 
__label__1 have just seen the australian premiere of shower xizhao at the sydney film festival the program notes said it was a perfect delight deftly made touching amusing dramatic and poignantly meaningful i couldn t agree more i just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and i look forward to seeing more chinese films planned to be shown in sydney in the coming months 
__label__1 i waited until the 4th of july to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day in 1924 d w griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm 1921 he d been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution dar who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn t a trace of patrick henry anywhere we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague carol dempster a leading lady for griffith for many years complicating matters is the fact that nancy s father hates nathan well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan s arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy s dad paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire comparisons with birth of a nation 1915 are inevitable the montague family might just as well be the cameron s from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army in this case the redcoats storming a trench packed with patriots the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man s land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isn t scope g w billy bitzer s camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is dare i say it sincerity the brutality of capt butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen don t expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance 1916 in one scene butler s second in command capt hare louis wolhiem gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on hare s face as he obviously has a good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912 a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d w knowing the reputation of his famous family said i am not hiring stage actors to which lionel replied and i am nothing of the kind sir he makes a very good and quite believable villain louis wolhiem appeared with lionel s older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr jekyll and mr hyde both 1920 and later in the tempest 1927 as capt hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and i was scared to death he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually waned speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere s ride he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce to arms the regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground i am amazed griffith did not do another take so is america a classic yes don t wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime 
__label__1 this movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson in japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio in the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her but is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be 
__label__1  this is not a love song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal i believe that heaton is in love with spike but spike is too naive to see this i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences heaton shows great intimacy towards spike with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike s name on the top of his letters one thing i ve noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they haven t even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven t recognised it when they use phrases like who is heaton what s he doing with a retard like spike this person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark spike shows noticeable signs of having a d d although i don t think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory term i really enjoyed this film although it is not for the faint hearted the film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isn t much but dialogue between the two anti heroes unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away 
__label__1 being the first feature film with robert de niro although not released for years later this is worth the watch de niro s role isn t huge yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today 
__label__1 a classy film pulled in 2 directions to its advantage it is directed by wes craven on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club his latest invention a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later the actor scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine lucci and barbara steele s portrait in black sunday were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film 
__label__0 this has an interesting albeit somewhat fanciful sci fi plot but it s wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects rae dawn chong is appealing despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent 
__label__0 well i do like the gore in this movie it is genuingly unsetteling anyone that s been to the dentist will know why the story really isn t that bad corbin bersen s character s motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies i ve seen worse acting directing script etc but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not i tried to watch the sequel but it was exactly exactly the same thing as this movie just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist then this is the movie for you 
__label__0 ladies and gentlemen please don t get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tag this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film in shining there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive foolish attempt made to create chilling horror everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do there is not much to be said of a bald colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes 
__label__1 every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just won t give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak laurence harvey version the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can t speak russian i m sure funny how people miss the point the no goodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mind blowing 
__label__0 why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers that point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie i think sports movies fall into two categories well made movies about the human spirit and competitions and by the sword honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be a touching drama for trying to be your best in life an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick in the end it didn t do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it for the record i also am a fencing instructor and now i am officially as bad as the rest but putting bad fencing in a movie doesn t make it bad automatically i mean look at star wars episodes 4 6 good movies bad fencing i liked those movies but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort don t be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing this is just a bad movie in the end this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells when i see a movie and am forced to think man i wish i was watching the mighty ducks i know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back 
__label__0 the lowest score possible is one star that s a shame really i m going to lobby imdb for a zero stars option to give this film even a single star is giving way too much am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper s head at the station and the acting or should i say the lack thereof apparently talent wasn t a factor when the casting director came to town my little sister s elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been oh wait no no it s already as bad as it can get 
__label__1 this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever and may be one of the best movies ever it s got a great plot that functions like a puzzle with lots of intrigue and suspense this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions with people hiding their identities and their natures the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality s and desires the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film when this happens the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective we actually care when people are killed in this film this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain at the same time this is also a fun movie it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film there is bad dubbing the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic all this just adds to the greatness of the film and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic everything goes by so fast because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is the lighting and composition are spectacular at times the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it s confines he doesn t rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level it s art it s trash it s emotionally moving and it s fun it has a true sense of morality but doesn t allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not 
__label__0 yes this movie is a real thief it stole some shiny oscars from avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to boost the acceptance support for the wars u s is still fighting today i do not really want to go here into politics but come on this is more clear than the summer sky hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding no real plot at all i really feel myself in the 50 s of hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like the same propaganda movies were produced that time only with the exception that those were black and white even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the u s wars are cool genre you surely have much better movies to choose from 
__label__1 there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except as jesse says it s the berries all of page one s commentators wrote eloquently as almost so as the dialog is in this movie this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actors actresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lost i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens the church s pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev maclean did in his church that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches no holy rollering in my church it was a big church with many different programs to keep its congregation busy the most inspiring perhaps was the music department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems too the sunday evening congregation was almost entirely younger people are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night how i wish it still was watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the open space beauties of montana yet aren t there also missile silos there too fly fishing or any other activity which draws family members closer together for a happy life and deep understanding of one another becomes a blessing although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it speakeasies and prostitutes are counter balanced by the simple gatherings of old fashioned community picnics as this movie contains in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer this is the third film i ve seen in which tom skeritt plays a father all different styles and brilliantly acted brad pitt mostly an undiscovered talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the cast members deserved many awards little stories superbly told will get 10 of 10 from me over any movie with violence foul language ugliness and action i am thinking particularly of crash and most of arnold s movies what a savior for peace this movie is 
__label__1 way back in 1955 the british made a comedy called simon and laura with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall to this day it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and more particularly about how television sitcoms become so popular it was and is an excellent example also of self referential cinema so also soapdish a film i d never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well as you know however i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv in fact it s been a while since i laughed so heartily so if you like satire i d recommend you see it the main actors sally field kevin kline robert downey and cathy moriarty quite simply do an excellent job revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is as i watched it i kept thinking to myself just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life that is if actors ever do have a real life as you probably know peter sellers for example was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters so that nobody really knew the real person so as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finch is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter lori played by elizabeth shue and in an emotional moment repeats the fictional lines she d used on a prior episode of her daytime soap when confronting her fictional daughter in that show are you confused well it s not all like that but the dialog is stunning for originality comedy bitchiness anger depravity duplicity and even love the story well there are many stories in this film all interwoven and which all come together at the end of course but not like a robert altman film okay and not all of them are resolved finally life s not like that anyway right the pace is almost frenetic and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it you won t regret the time usage the rest of the cast all perform well although i ve never taken much to whoopi goldberg perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and for my money the latter steals so many scenes from others she gets my vote as the outstanding player i kid you not she gives the term bitch an entirely new face 
__label__1 i watch romantic comedies with some hesitation for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting typically in a romantic comedy there is a girl and there is a guy both fall in love then have troubles and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever but this movie is a different story it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately there is a widowed guy dan there is a girl marie dan meets marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime after sometime marie has to leave dan develops something for her and when this something starts to turn meaningful we get a twist marie is the girlfriend of his brother unheeded of the circumstances dan flirts with marie and realizes that he loves her and even marie loves him but their love would not just be possible how it is made possible forms the rest of the story steve carell performs well juliette binoche is good as marie and every other stuff is done well it is a good movie watch it 
__label__0 the secret is this movie blows sorry but it just did spoiler in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream beth played admirably by dorie barton joins several friends on a spring break trip the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation then the deaths begin first one then another then another of the friends is murdered leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results one note dorie barton is the poor man s reese witherspoon she looks like reese acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police lineup maybe that s how they cast her anyhoo decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing 
__label__1 it s a bit easy that s about it the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d but that s forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it s the same for every platform game like banjo kazooie and donkey kong 64 i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 and since then i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times 
__label__1 i read somewhere in a fairly panning review that this is something of a live action mecha anime and i think they re on the right lines i first watched this movie when i was very young and i ve been dying to see it again and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back i don t think this is to be taken too seriously it s just a bit of good old 80 s almost a tv movie fun it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future although this point isn t stressed too much what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn t sound generic no clichés no predictable lines all in all just good fun maybe time hasn t been kind to this little movie but still i can find appreciation for it in me it s by no means perfect but it s entertaining and doesn t try to be anything other than that let the nerds and comic store guys worry about technicalities who cares see it for yourself and make your own decision no one else s opinion matters 
__label__1 i first saw the film when it landed on us cable a year after it came out it blew my little head away i was only 16 and it was the first new wave music i d heard having been a strictly folky classical kid growing up the music mesmerized me as did hazel o connor s amazing look and charismatic vocal performances and phil daniels tough but soft cockney manager just stole my heart but i think my favorite character was jonathan pryce s drugged out sax player he was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic he just begged for sympathy favorite scenes the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the train okay so the movie isn t the rose but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80 s exploding with rebellious youth looking for a way out of the dole queue i went to britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere i found when i was there if you get a chance to see it it is a great movie with some wonderful performances and the music will blow you away 
__label__1 as a long time fan of peter o donnell s greatest creation i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modesty s life only alluded to in the novels as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography yes the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows but does it spoil the viewer s enjoyment in this case i think not instead we are introduced to one of the world s greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities in regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor lob for me they were totally credible alexandra staden described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine brought to the screen modesty s poise and coolness her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canon ok so we all know this film was produced to stake miramax s claim to the modesty blaise character it was made quickly and cheaply but i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories 
__label__1 beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature forbidden lie 2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouri s book forbidden love and that was a best seller an onion peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie is the very best in editorialised reality tv cleverly edited and colourful broinowski s storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke i disagree with variety that it s overlong instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others just recorded testimonials on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired so i watched it twice this oscar worthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri s friends and fans clearly these friends are now turned the funniest on camera line belonging to khouri s qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat no nonsense colloquialisms i think it s a load of sh t personally we need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers any perennial lie spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie there s some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian who instead presses her con artist repeatedly for corroboration since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication khouri has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name she absconded supposedly because a she s either terrified of her sly more italian sounding than greek husband or b because she needed her passport visas to clear her name unlikely a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no not jordan according to a closing card khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge instead the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen once they caught on there was plenty counter derision and catcalls earlier stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn t know how to take khouri s evolving contradictions the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first key to how a lifelong liar operates in half truths khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr old with rather disarming charm and surprisingly worked out biceps gradually we re introduced to less and less adulating aussie journos publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri s honour killing accusations hook line and sinker later we see their more rueful reactions quite self controlled and matter of fact if some perhaps a little bitter it was jordanian anti honour killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri s fallacies because its pot stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change honour killings do happen in jordan it s just their prevalence that s at odds with khouri s book plus 72 other facts in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakingly checked objections the publishing houses across 4 continents who d jumped at the chance to publish first time author khouri never tried to check any facts leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract they too were fair game so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes later still we re shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouri s bio as well for one thing she s not only not a 35yr old virgin her defence is that she merely didn t disabuse people of their assumptions but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers sometimes she s just too fast talking in her american accent she also seems too comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don t need any western paternalism from me but when even cultural cues don t jibe in addition to khouri s facts you ve got to start questioning your source at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account in person in jordan the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to amman where one fact after another falls eventually broinowski forces her con artist to admit the decade discrepancy in her story and it s after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera secret because in it khouri s american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he s an actor we never find out how anna uncovered it so this becomes the filmmaker s triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment her on camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt fbi documents and khouri s most shocking initial crime anna broinowski watch list her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players cross commenting on footage to kill two birds making her audiences want to drink from the same well again in fact despite her deceptively demure approach she made me re confirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their norma khouri investigation broinowski made me look 10 10 
__label__1 marjorie a splendid and riveting performance by farrah fawcett narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by vicious serial rapist joe superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by james russo however joe steals her wallet and finds out where marjorie lives he pays her a visit one fateful day after subjecting marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse marjorie manages to turn the tables on joe and locks him in the fireplace what is marjorie going to do with joe director robert m young and screenwriter william mastrosimone concoct a harsh gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity joe perceives women strictly as objects while marjorie only sees joe as an animal however this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make joe out to be simply a vile one dimensional creep instead he s a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid joe s climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant fawcett and russo are both outstanding in the leads they receive fine support from diana scarwid as the passive terry alfre woodard as the sensible patricia and sandy martin as sympathetic policewoman officer sudow both curtis clark s agile cinematography and j a c redford s shivery skin crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension a real powerhouse 
__label__1 i truly enjoyed this film the acting was terrific as was the plot jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for the only part of this flick i would change was the ending the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel there were some interesting religious messages in this film jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature or shark if you prefer represented the anti chirst there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that end of the world feel i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature i know many people won t get the references to christianity but if you watch close you ll get it 
__label__1 in what must be one of the most blood freezing movies ever a transvestite is murdering people in new york and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff michael caine plays a most thought provoking character while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo keith gordon who later starred in christine is probably the most interesting character in the movie but you can t really understand this movie without seeing it and after seeing it you may never know just whom you can trust also starring nancy allen and dennis franz 
__label__1 there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl but by spielmann and other directors as well this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie hundstage is no exception this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing but real people instead so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern sudern complaining their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is according to many especially made for complaining as a way of life a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens moreover they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure giving activities trying to stay in touch with their human selves yet in vain the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality abnormality of its images only another typical feature of seidl and other austrian directors is his showing of disturbingly sexual images these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband the sexual scenes in the bath the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment etc in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris new york or madrid the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation albeit in different circumstances in the end i believe seidl s film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation seidl has achieved his goal 
__label__1 i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie which is why i left it unwatched for so long but i was very pleasantly surprised far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car boat chases it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails with nothing being overstated or over rationalized it s likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that less time and effort was spent on finding ever stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching hell the biggest gun battle takes place off screen and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise that adds to the suspense who s winning who s dying alexandra staden might not be as drop dead gorgeous as monica vitti but few are and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that s needed to make the character work and the shape of her face her hair and her tall slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic strip graphics nikolaj coaster waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad guy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch even likable and i doubt i d consider taking on many brutal psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies i can t think of a single one of hollywood s former waiters who could have pulled the role off that well fortunately blaise baddies always die in the end no spoilers there that s a really good thing because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes 
__label__1  i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain this is an excell film it should have been re rated to pg 13 but anyways prince s first film and greatest the follow up sucked but i haven t seen for years so here s what i can remember about it the kid prince has to juggle with winning over the love of his life apollonia herself keeping his band together the revolution as themselves and the tension in his family but his rival band the time as themselves is ruining his life like morris himself is trying to steal apollonia from the kid just like saturday night fever flashdance and 8 mile really good rent it laugh and cry and if you luv it buy it 
__label__1 first off this really is my favorite film ever i don t need to give anyone a description because every a hole does that i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having boom stick showing badly edited 80 s metal horror masterpiece the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy jason type of deal for himself damn i wish that could ve went down like that the soundtrack s banging the acting s good check this mofo out and any die hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime midgetorgy i can be found at yahoo 
__label__1 sure star wars a movie i have seen at least fifty times beats all the others in special effects but this film has every thing else it has horror non graphical romance robots witty repartee intelligence surprisingly good special effects and drama i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print and i was amazed at how well it held up today i thought the old 40 s style electronics would look hokey but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne ann francis in here mostly short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me of course we all know that the great bird of the galaxy probably modeled much of star trek from this movie no one has yet to beat robby the robot in terms of personality sorry r2d2 and c3po this movie overall is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles 
__label__0 i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self i don t wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny what is wrong with these people i m not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat i watched this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that its painful most bad films are funny because they are crap the animal is just disgusting watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we don t need you i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize 
__label__1 i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun and the song saying goodbye always moves me what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and great talent why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting moving and funny is it that mr henson is just so very missed 
__label__1 a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i m tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i m tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i m tired of the same old stuff in movies 
__label__1 as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
__label__1 the history of the fbi as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks interwoven with his personal life story stewart and miles as his wife are pretty good as is hamilton as an earnest agent the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved it s like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who s who cast of gangsters some of the episodes are too long some too short and some just look out of place stewart s daughter s school sequence overall it goes on way too long nevertheless it s worth a look for its handsome production values 
__label__1 i just saw the movie on tv i really enjoyed it i like a good mystery and this one had me guessing up to the end sean connery did a good job i would recomend it to a friend 
__label__0 the supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop standard stalk and slash picture yet well acted and directed thus making it oddly interesting and watchable though the violence isn t for the squeamish especially the director s cut which was originally given an nc 17 rating 1 2 out of 
__label__0 i m still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film for content that s supposed to be so rebellious and controversial the things that maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets rebel everybody i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn t get set off apparently a huge fight up on the football fields is a fight that consists of two people characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random a football jock who maddox was fighting and who subsequently got a staple on the face is all smiles and apologies the next day the fact that it doesn t come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudo glitch soundtrack 
__label__1 this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay ulee s gold nice and straightforward writing that was nominated for the independent spirit award looking at ruby s day to day life what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby ashley judd sisters won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity she explores jobs friendships boy friends sex a typical young adult search the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance i appreciate this type of movie because it does not carry the hollywood baggage although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody s fool staring paul newman the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man i like that the story is very nicely told and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story the only thing i am not sure about is the title i am sure that there are not that many bugs and flies in paradise as there are in florida as i am allergic to mosquitos florida is no paradise to me i itch all over thinking about florida i turn into a complete red boil i recommend this movie favorite scenes ruby and her friend rochelle bridges played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city florida indeed the sand is very white i have been there favorite quotes necessity has always been a good excuse all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now who is going to be and when and why 
__label__1 i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise i didn t cared much about tom cruise s acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character they merge and then speak and its beautiful however i must say this movie doesn t come under the average flick of weekend which you pick at random and watch gleefully it carries strong sentiments and characters so don t wash this one down with your beer and pop corns it certainly needs more than that 
__label__1 why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime conan is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better the brutal violence cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen this is not similar to bakshi s usual frenetic style it s quite a departure for bakshi and in my opinion his best work i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves 
__label__0 1st the good news the 3 d is spectacularly well done and they don t go for the gotcha gimmicks the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story buzz aldrin and now the meat of the matter it s about flies for krissakes flies with big googy human eyes true but flies nonetheless remember when i likened the underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches that wasn t intended as praise and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally this one s got even less empathy going for it baby maggots ugh in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as space chimps also about critters in space go rent apollo 13 and see a 9 rated movie about the real space program rip 
__label__0 i am a lover of b movies give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing then there was hammerhead which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others first there was the science of creating the shark man which the movie barely touched on in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effects back to the science i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and i m sorry to say pretty bad acting not even william forsythe hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker 
__label__1 it s a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn t done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himself then she seeks revenge and the rest you better see it from the movie i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics but one way or another it s the story of lady death 
__label__0 this show was absolutely terrible for one george isn t funny and his kids are snobby little brats he also treats his mother with no respect as a hispanic i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed plus the dysfunctional family thing s been done to death for once i want to see something original what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air but sadly we re going to have to stomach this until they jump the shark in my opinion they already did 
__label__0 you know what kind of movie you re getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair in what seems to be a bakery truck only to have the prison vehicle collide with and i m not making this up a genetic engineering tanker truck the goo which spurts forth melts him and fuses his dna with the snow creating our protagonist the killer snowman my favorite portion of the movie however is an over the shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven potholder gloves mmmmm schlock 
__label__0 the worst thing about crush is not that it s acted pretty bad or that the plot is virtually non existent and it s not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better no the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come but in the end it s too little too late if you are a fan of violin music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40 women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage then by all means don t miss it i myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie and as a result i had a pretty horrible time the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it the verdict 4 10 guilty of wasting my time 
__label__0 there s only one thing i need to say about this movie the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra s character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie the story is horrible the acting is terrible c mon it s shaq and i d rather see capra in free willy equally horrible twice before ever seeing this movie 
__label__1 why aren t more films especially american more like meatball machine this is my first official on line review and i am charged with electrical ecstasy after having chosen meatball machine as my first endeavor this is a review so i ll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion i mean this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo so what if it s not all original i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance meatball machine is as elaborate in it s story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore thank you jesus for japanese cinema simply put the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end this time at 31 my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood humans become flesh eating cyborgs there s more fight scenes great music great point of view shots decent acting by the woman cyborg at least better than her male counterpart the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times oh and did i forget to mention it s a love story wow i hate love stories but this takes the cake i can t wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces sadly i took time to write this review because i m afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine lastly my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless normally she says something like why are you watching that junk this time she had nothing to say i was glad this is not junk this isn t just splatter splatter for the sake of splatter is also great this is art my friends art chacho
__label__0 i m easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable i ve even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that i ve seen that i can honestly say was bad and this was it it s been a while since i ve seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this it s honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend 
__label__0 i viewed this movie in dvd format my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani while fun to watch i feel she didn t live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance the other two actors i wasn t very familiar with so i can t compare their performance however they were fairly enjoyable also the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion the story line while some could say slightly compelling lacked direction i feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film but otherwise leave it alone 
__label__0  a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn t care who he has to kill to get it the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life if this sounds ridiculous it is the whole idea that this izod wearing dune buggy driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly his friend may be good with a gun but he s up against a group of trained killers the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob there s also a sub plot about how the friend s father was killed years ago by the mob boss but there s little made of it and it doesn t help the movie any at all the mob boss mister scarface is played by jack palance i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck i ve seen some pretty good italian crime cop flicks recently but mister scarface isn t one of them check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead 
__label__1 i saw this film first on my way home from paris to newark aboard air france in august 1996 the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece it s the kind of film that people should be making i still think daniel auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around in this french film he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men daniel s life and ours changes forever with the down syndrome man he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that s what life should be all about the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it s one of my favorite movies it s enough to bring a tear to your eye 
__label__0 had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix i d have a couple of hours of my life back i m frankly suspicious when i see that a film s director also wrote it in this case according to the credits the same guy was writter and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there were a few interesting moments e g judy tenuta s scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy ism which led me to rate this two stars rather than one those moments however were few and far between and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i d seen the whole thing nope though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later the spinning camera technique was overused and essentially pointless i found myself talking to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommended 
__label__0 i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after he d been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facility which has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space thus begins the part of the movie that s pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then there s a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around you d think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we re treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director s girlfriend anyone the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that s it that s the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel 
__label__0 since the 70s writer producer director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction fantasy and horror b movies some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad trancers 1985 was one of those rare gems a terminator style tale of time travel and action trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth a future cop given the task of tracking down bad guy whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the trancers of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop him in this 1991 sequel jack is still living in 1985 having destroyed whistler he has settled down and married leena helen hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie but for jack things don t stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of whistler s brother e d wardo who is trying to build a trancer army trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was the story is difficult to pick up if you haven t seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one liners and a script that feels like it was written on the fly about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci fi and horror movies jeffrey combs barbara crampton richard lynch martine beswicke unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an off day whilst filming trancers ii and performances are mediocre at best the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing i can t imagine them being any good 
__label__0 east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective with frank sinatra in the role of the cop and william windom is the boy it s a progressive film for china i guess but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy he cruises the park without fear he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer and that in fact happens then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture made to squat for a period of time handcuffed slapped this is what the gay man wants and implicitly the gay man is challenging the cop s self image as a manly man the story s about the gay man s life which include flashbacks are tolerable but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works the movie becomes unbearable it becomes a cry of pity for china s gays who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society sorry i can t relate 
__label__1 this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isn t on any of her collections the reason why is probably because it doesn t have a happy ending unlike all her other films its also not a musical although she does belt out one song called the world owes me a living the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white the version i have is in colour and on vhs i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic unlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful the film is good for its age and the story hasn t dated at all i m surprised no one has tried to do a remake at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five although don t be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it especially when jerry gary cooper steals a necklace and hides it in shirley s teddy bear the tension and slow build up to his actions while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room is very well directed gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good in all this is a good film from the early 30 s accept it for its age 
__label__0 okay the story makes no sense the characters lack any dimensionally the best dialogue is ad libs about the low quality of movie the cinematography is dismal and only editing saves a bit of the muddle but sam peckinpah directed the film somehow his direction is not enough for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work this movie is a disappointment even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah james caan robert duvall burt young bo hopkins arthur hill and even gig young bring to their work watch the great peckinpah films skip this mess 
__label__1 my favorite jackie chan movie will always be drunken master 1978 followed by this film from 1985 police story in it chan plays a hong kong super cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the man s girlfriend brigitte lin so that she can turn state s evidence as the story goes on the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay like drunken master police story has many of the signature stunts and over the top martial arts action choreography that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall in his role as director chan exceeds in excellence giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of drunken master at heart police story is just that a police story a gritty cop thriller that would be oft copied over the years to come 10 10
__label__0 kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer but the comedy is scatter shot its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso i kept asking what am i watching i watched it from start to finish and i still don t know what the hell happened its a shame since there are some great action scenes some amusing jokes and the occasional moment but nothing none of it ever comes together i d take a pass 
__label__0 a major disappointment this was one of the best uk crime drama detective shows from the 90 s which developed the fascinating title character played by scotland s robbie coltrane however this one off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus coltrane isn t really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems uninvolved almost bored the ex soldier s story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltrane s family life seems lightweight perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two hour show they would have written this with much more depth as is skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90 s which is far far superior 
__label__0 ok its not the best film i ve ever seen but at the same time i ve been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it 
__label__1 if ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone disabled or not to persevere despite the odds and make it even when make it as an expression proper can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth my left foot is it it s a hard film to watch at times seeing the less placid aspects of christy brown s personality emerge in two key scenes one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction and at a dinner table when the woman who s reached out to him made him able to communicate effectively now has announced at a key moment the inauguration of brown s art she is about to marry another man is tough very very tough more so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how via screams shrieks and profanities aimed at hurting himself however this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account but that of a man overcoming his severe disability becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world daniel day lewis won an oscar for his powerful unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious christy brown and brenda fricker did so as well for her supporting role as brown s solid mother 
__label__1 in my line of work i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film when i can i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs once in a while though there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible the short film b r o k e n directed by alex ferrari is a genuine surprise and worth a second look clocking in at a scant 20 minutes b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home when she awakes she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book these nasty guys and girls are larger than life they are all guns and knives there is no way out the kicker here is that despite being a low budget film it doesn t play like one from the very beginning the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot edited and produced by professionals it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers the film is sharp and cool it looks good and it feels like something big the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer duncan were well chosen as two of the few speaking roles in the film it is up to them to carry the film no special effects no matter how good would have saved this film from bad acting thankfully polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent but it hardly shows the downside to b r o k e n is that it s only 20 minutes long the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle watching it i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop but it comes off as unsatisfying i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film my rating 8 out of 10 
__label__0 i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently in my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sour the story a u s soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u s has sent out to troops for christmas he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while we learn that he doesn t have a family back home the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company the family comes to love him and vice versa the soldier also becomes in love with the family s daughter the woman that sent the christmas card there s only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that she s in love with it s also a long distance relationship the boyfriend is very different from the soldier he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors the woman prefers the latter throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the woman s boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what s best for her daughter spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common they happen to spend a lot of time together she gradually becomes attracted to his persona then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back now she s so confused she s in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but she s become so fond of the soldier soon enough the boyfriend who doesn t know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts his plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family he wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along this doesn t sound too thrilling for the woman however the soldier feels bad about what he s done and doesn t want to make things worse so he decides to leave town despite the dad s urging him to stay and be with his daughter it all comes to a head when at the christmas eve service with church we find out that the soldier hasn t left yet the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he broken hearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film he s basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong things i don t like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with church and participates in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough so the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself therefore i don t recommend this film to anyone 
__label__1 greetings again from the darkness what a relief a thriller that actually is thrilling new it girl rachel mcadams wedding crashers and the notebook dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven scream movies and a nightmare on elm street craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane what makes this one work is the realism of the first 15 20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone she is a natural when she meets cillian murphy the scarecrow in batman begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight watching the two yuppie types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching film making the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue as with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we can t help but cringe a bit the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger cillian s injury and the fx at the hotel the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under utilized but overall this is an above average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale 
__label__0 what s up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a lawyer s office where everyone works by candlelight don t waste your time in fact don t waste your time with anything altman makes it s all a pretentious waste of film 
__label__0  ninteen eighty four is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self centred the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places however despite the film s cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story 
__label__1 for quite a long time in my life i either did not like this film or i liked this film but not as much as many more i watched it recently at a sleepover funnily enough and i liked it more than i had done since i was under 6 or something i now appreciate it more as i do with a few other disney classics that i have watched recently including sleeping beauty and pinnochio or however you spell it i now very much appreciate the animation the clever disney plot turns the humour from the mice the emotions expressed and the plot the animation is very well done often it seems you are wherever the other characters are watching them the animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds including the town which is shown twice briefly disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way injecting clever plot turns such as the mice making the clothes and the key part usually i do not like disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story but with this i am not overly bothered i feel they made necessary changes to make this a good disney film often i do not think disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films you know the story already cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters she goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper this is a film very much to be watched with other people immediate family is not good enough to enjoy this i recommend you watch it with friends and immediate family if you like i recommend this to people who like disney at least a little bit people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice enjoy :) :)
__label__0 well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kira s sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies it just doesn t look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end kira s new lover is a killer whoa how shocking why don t we nominate this movie for oscar award i can t imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r rated mine is imported from uk rated 18 conclusion put it down and walk away so yon won t end up with being a moron like me score 2 10

__label__1 i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big art house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal cause celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court what s potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what s revealed in the sex or nudity the director actor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it s always more so an intellectual expression than very lust like but the daring of the attempt at a pure metafilm while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country i e usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heated up politically at least that s part of sjoman s aim here like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w r if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hot cold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialist wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and trains sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film there s even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this there s a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey i m the director playing the director bit at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lena s father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes it s impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary film within a film and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasi guru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesn t feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer if i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isn t entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner film of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clichés borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavy handed narration from his starlet of sorts and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldn t be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage i d even go as far as to say it s influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant garde or meta film making if it s not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w r or last tango it s close behind 
__label__1 from a modern sensibility it s sometimes hard to watch older films it s annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man especially such a shallow and inconstant man he s obviously a player i wouldn t trust him to stay true to her who doesn t want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby ick even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after he s supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him i wanted her to stand up to him not pathetically chase after him his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me apart from that subplot i did like the movie how can you not like sailors dancing with each other you can tell they were from san francisco d the rehearsal dance was great watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the correct steps was great the last dance scene face the music with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful and i really enjoyed we saw the sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song anyway the plot was a bit weak like most musicals imo and the songs were ok but the dancing was worth watching the film for i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set it s also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land ;D
__label__1 i went and saw rivers and tides again today it s the second time in two days and yes i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy s works this morning when i threw the coins i received 29 the abysmal water goldsworthy has an affinity with water hence the title i received the 5th line changing which moved to 7 the army to blake art was a war anyway i knew i had to see the film again i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy s comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film he d rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack so i was aware of that as i watched this second time yesterday i thought that i d vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art his understanding of water time stone change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar some of his work words are zen like his knowledge anyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the bay area be a trend setter go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film you ve heard about from the hinter lands it s called rivers and tides

__label__1 this is my all time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like i m putting all my eggs in one basket and let s face the music and dance if i remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart sorry for the sentimental cr p but i m woman so get over it all in all this film gets an 8 10 from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome 
__label__1 this movie is an awesome non stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy bumbling heroes buffoonish supporting characters made up dolls for heroines nasty villains wisecracks rocking soundtrack choreography and a little dose of action amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop heroines are mere rouge smothered props as usual the conmen have no heroines paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward he played a similar don in khoobsurat too asrani shines in a brief role he does a retake on his famous angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer act in sholay govinda is impeccable as usual as a wisecracking good humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results amitabh bachchan believe it or not pales in comparison with him but still ab is fine madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song makhna she dances like wind viju shah s music is awesome check out kisi disco mein jaayen makhna and the title track do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely just enjoy yourself 
__label__1 i recently saw i q and even though i m not a romantic comedy type of gal i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch so many movies in my opinion lack honesty you know that feeling when you re watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it s taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love nothing is what it seems i would recommend this for a sunday morning 7 10
__label__0 about 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should ve been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up very rare we d sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next gross out or offensive remark s after about 35 minutes we both got up and left everything we d read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasn t a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool it s the only other movie i ve ever walked out on and i have no regrets i m sick of trying to go see comedies in america 
__label__0 i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist where the exorcist was subtle and creepy stigmata was blunt clumsy and way too formulaic this is one of the most visually beautiful films i ve seen in a while but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable my interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to the exorcist and my visit to the official web site increased that interest the web site had many tales of actual stigmata throughout history however scene by scene the movie is so obsessed by its quest for genuineness that it becomes comical at first then outright hard to watch toward the end i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would be heroine cuts hair and evidently flirts with priests the plot a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ the stigmata and is baffled and upset about the ordeal a priest is sent straight from the vatican to investigate the case is frankie possessed by satan or a vessel for jesus christ the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends

__label__1 i ve just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it s certainly made for a curious afternoon s entertainment bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form the deleted scenes especially those with mcdowall link events together quite neatly what is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered clearly the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue which would have been great except that half the cast weren t around to do it some for better reasons than others and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it some of the lip synching is pretty poor and david tomlinson s voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson there s actually a hint of german in it i think however good to hear the full versions of all the songs although step in the right direction is still absent and the moments of magic in this film still shine through and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos but what s that got to do with my knob 
__label__0 for a comedic writer woody allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development there are a few entertaining moments but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls will ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery amanda peet did well but again didn t have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie the movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried radha mitchell did it if you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don t really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion then you ll love this movie 
__label__0 note to self just because a film is foreign obscure and stars catherine zeta jones doesn t mean it s any good such is the case with blue juice a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem to a dumb american anyway an even more unlikely place to find surfers cornwall england you might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing quirky little comedy if only the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable the easiest way to describe it is as a sort of 90 s british version of grease without the dancing but even that makes it sound better than it is no the best way to take it is as a little slice of life set in a small town catherine zeta jones plays chloe a young woman living with a surfing instructor jc sean pertwee you remember him pertwee is actually the film s star and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this in this case it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer and a fat nerdy guy who in a needlessly extended scene gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him i can t honestly say everything that goes on in blue juice is predictable since it s set in a place and reflects customs and manners i m not very familiar with but there s certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters the comedy though is very predictable and tired one can sense the set ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue in american form of course before the actors do the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed she wants him to grow up he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being he s afraid of losing face with his gang she thinks he prefers them to her you get the idea as i struggled to stay focused on blue juice toward the end i felt as the saying goes that this was an hour and half of my life i d never get back 
__label__0 just in time to capitalize on the long awaited movie version of dreamgirls is the dvd release of this semi forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the supremes as its inspiration released five years before the broadway opening of dreamgirls and partially set in the same period it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up and coming girl group and that s where the resemblance basically ends written by joel schumacher well before he became a big league director of mainstream studio product batman forever the phantom of the opera this movie seems grittier on the surface true to form however schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichés and eye rolling one liners with little affinity for staging musical numbers sam o steen a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director helms the production like a low budget tv movie with a frustratingly episodic structure the story follows three harlem sisters sexy sister self righteous delores and sweet sparkle as they sing in the church choir meet smooth talking but well intentioned boys stix and levi and then find their first taste of success as a singing group first as a sweater wearing quintet called the hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as sister and the sisters but naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer satin struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick up for satin stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some jewish mobsters for financial help delores just gets plain fed up and poor little sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants a big plus is that r b great curtis mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs some catchy and one look into your heart a real winner the solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances lonette mckee s valiant attempt to make sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham fisted plot turns including a sad billie holliday like turn at the mike before they hit it big on primetime tv philip michael thomas and dorian harewood portray stix and levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility the best work comes from mary alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls patient mother and a pre fame irene cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene the dvd just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice over by dj casey kasem and a bonus cd of five of the film s songs performed not by the original cast but by aretha franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack it s not a terrible movie just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as dreamgirls 
__label__0 feh this movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so the dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living people pusses both the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been better maybe because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing but this doesn t come to pass even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter no mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing the priest merely makes the girl s spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her as she d crushed his spine like peanut brittle at which point i was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the dead girl ewwww the robitussen sucking spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and that s it no real horror no real creepiness which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on over the top cheesy face make up no screaming mimis i was very disappointed 
__label__1 polish film maker walerian borowczyk s la bête french 1975 aka the beast is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too this film tells everything that s generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images the images may look wild perverse sick or exciting but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned sex desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it they interest and temptate us so powerfully and by our nature that they are considered scary unacceptable and something too wild to be true a sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a french countryside to meet her soon to become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind all are very exciting and each others parents and relatives wait impatiently to see the new people arriving to their families the innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful french mansion with all its humans and animals and a mysterious la bête that turns out to be something that the characters nor most of the film s audience could have never imagined to be real and in front of them the film is about the same theme as canadian david cronenberg s debyt feature shivers 1975 which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory parasites spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act furiously and violently in their lust for pleasure and fulfilment of instincts human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal a beast be it a lust for blood revenge or sex and carnal pleasure humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us the film opens greatly and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there not the close ups of organs as could be so easily claimed the horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat in heat that s much stronger than his will as he doesn t have any control at that point anymore the power of the instinct makes an animal a beast after the memorable beginning the characters get introduced and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their blossom to the adults and elders that all represent their own part of the lifespan creating the face of human life on screen a film doesn t necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race including the urban and countryside inhabitants and both sexes the mansion makes the protagonist girl s sexuality wake as she saws the horses coupling and acting like she obviously has never thought of for the first time she sees something unique and something that excites and feels almost vital for her and her body like getting water when you re very thirsty the transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her with his mother and camera and a letter boyfriend even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades man s stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated the film s last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk as the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the undressed form of ourselves having lived in the woods without other people beasts near him the dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the film s overall straight and honest attitude and the images are so easy to be judged as perverse and pornographic without a courage to go deeper into them character reactions and thoughts behind what we see the images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the dream s more human character and borowczyk forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a normal sexual act between a man and a female which is a beautiful thing and expression of love another human need also the numerous and cleverly blackly humorous love making scenes inside the mansion between the young mother and the black servant get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant for example and there s no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least doesn t become any more pleasant by the interruption borowczyk has managed to paint his images so beautiful and sensitive that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art he uses dialogue only when it s necessary otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful death is also there as flesh dies sooner or later after years of life and instincts it dies the ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and revealing ending too another blackly humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for they visited the mansion of truth about flesh us and them the film reminds me of french writer georges bataille s story of the eye with its same themes about eroticism death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh the book is well written and fantastic as well as this film and naturally both have been blamed for their too explicit content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments borowczyk s film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film the sun shines through the trees and to everyplace where humans live and the beauty of it is always there but so is the ugliness that originates by the inhabitants of the world to every innocent white sheep there s a selfish evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep present inside every human soul it is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active the fulfilment of some of our instincts is not a bad thing and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad they can be satisfied without exploitation violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it human is not more than an animal with intelligence intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment borowczyk s film is a masterpiece unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with ageless theme and also an example of how much can be achieved expressed and given by a film maker who is also only a human 
__label__1 this movie is simply wonderful it s got it all laughter sorrow beauty poetry truth all in a simple yet intense story like life you won t get distracted for a second 10 10p s somebody tell hollywood you need a good story to make a good movie and there are so many good stories out there 
__label__0 i love these actors but they were wasted in this flick i can only wonder what were they thinking agreeing to this crap debra winger just phoned it in dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures some people thought it was deep well if you liked breaking the waves you ll probably like this too i hated both 3 10
__label__0 this film may have been the biggest let down i ve experienced in renting movies based on imdb reviews overall i simply found this to be a second rate movie leslie cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and ma wu handles his character with cheerful competence on the other hand ma wu s makeup facial hair is so obviously phony that i simply could not take him seriously he looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for halloween complete with the 4 95 stick on beard the special effects were so so though the undead in the cellar were pretty good the tree tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick though the pov shots from the tongue s view more closely resembled sam raimi s trademark shots in the more recent evil dead trilogy the pyrotechnics were ho hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get in fact it most closely reminded me of the lost in space episode where the robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and the plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of european fairy tales there was no suspense and no plot twists in fact you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good who is bad and who is going to survive i just returned this film to netflix and then i sat down to write this review the very first thing i did was check the production date yep it says 1987 not the 1967 that i thought it might be and that pretty much sums it up the production values and fx are typical of the 1960s the plot and action seem much older as hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s out of 
__label__1 one of the greatest film i have seen this year last maybe before sun rise which is also seen late at night alone in the lab i like the idea of the film which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes i do like the end but a big question also comes the virus shall not be released again should it in the last scene in the airport jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr goines assistant so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus james keep an eye on him at the time remember and he has teeth so why everything is still happen why future scientists don t do anything after the truth is revealed my biggest question after the film 
__label__1 on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up i don t want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that haven t watched it yet but i will say that paresh rawal does not have an extensive role such as past priyadarshan movies for example hera pheri and hungama paresh rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him john abraham does equally well akshay kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from waqt and almost all his movies after andaaz even though all three heroins in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly nargis who is very good looking and hot i would say that if you liked hungama or hera pheri this movie is a must watch 
__label__1 i just saw this film in santa barbara my friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought i d check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music there was not a lot of talking in the film which at first felt a little strange but once i got into it i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things but know that i left the theater thinking about the film it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique 
__label__0 i refused to watch this when it originally aired treasuring the memory of the late lamented 1960s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope but i can never resist a challenge i should have known better not quite a remake and more of a parody than a homage this show didn t quite know how to play it and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors and only emilia fox could act bob mortimer is painful in a straight role the supporting cast were merely comedian acquaintances of vic and bob s wanting to be part of the in joke and far too aware of the situation to be convincing and the cgi though the effects couldn t help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue all style and no substance and whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time this update is now also very dated with matrix style fashions obligatory girl power scenes and less than subtle tension between the two living leads 
__label__0 i bought this dvd after seeing it highly ranked here it s just a short 20 minutes zombie film nothing special about it except for the music perhaps don t buy it not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it only if you re really bored 
__label__1 rented and watched this short 90 minutes work it s by far the best treatment modesty has received on film and her creator peter o donnell agrees participating as a creative consultant the character and we who love her are handled with respect spiegel s direction is the best he s done to date and the casting was very well done alexandra staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original jim holdaway illustrations of modesty a terrific find by whoever cast her raymond cruz as a young rafael garcia was also excellent i hope that tarantino co will go on to make more in the series i m especially interested to see whom they d choose to be the incomparable willie garvin 
__label__0 this movie has richard pryor rosey grier and others it s a curious ww2 movie and serves as a statement about racism it is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray meaning this is a 70 s movie not a 40 s movie ww2 still there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam the story centers on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company there is a scene that could be from a civil war movie and not a ww2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about the black lt gives a german women a innocent peck on the cheek and the white capt becomes upset i enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the genre were interesting to me 
__label__1 i grew up in southern west virginia i m about the same age as or maybe a year older than homer hickam author of the rocket boys the book forming the true story basis of this heart warming film and so i relate closely to the west virginia coal mining theme and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time october 4 1957 on all of us the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the science gap the u s s r had on the u s in those cold war days this is a wonderful film for everyone of all ages but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950 s it ll touch the core of your being everyone get it watch it recommend it to your friends who ll thank you many times 
__label__1 i had a personal interest in this movie when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton the big marine base there on the beach we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation which included a water tank gun entrenchments sand bagged trenches and living quarters all this was at very high pay sometimes golden time which was triple our regular hourly wage our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch etc which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out which was about eight or ten months later then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie s heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens a bit disappointing but still fun in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there bob weverka
__label__0 1st watched 12 7 2002 3 out of 10 dir steve purcell typical mary kate ashley fare with a few more kisses it looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways in this episode of their adventures they are interns in rome for a fashion designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about i guess besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it s finally revealed why they are getting fired then re hired then fired again then re hired again this is definetly made by people who don t understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it maybe the real world will be their next adventure if there is one even my kids didn t seem to care for this boring adventure in the make believe let s see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults we ll see what happens then

__label__0 think of this film as a saturday morning live action program from ages ago even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses i can t fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department too many warrior wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings and who in the world would ve let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place i thought this was a family movie mst3k here s another fine gem for your 1999 tv season 
__label__1 a beautiful postcard of new york the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear it never did my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch 
__label__1 i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual sensuality is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting they are not sean connory co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things or feel them again i think i m not objective i really enjoyed it that i know :)
__label__0 sugar spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie i ve heard that the dvd has a director s cut maybe i ll check it out but this pg 13 trash movie is s and the worst kind of s maybe if the film had some t a that would ve have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film 
__label__0 was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie the character leon is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie scary movie was stupid and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes the only role besides leon that had some humor that followed was will ferrell the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show the skits last about 5 minutes and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit then what is the world coming to molly shannon had superstar cheri o terri had scary movie but she wasnt a leading role and will had elf but that was good but he did some dumb movie but i cant remember and mike myers with wayne s world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals seen only one guy break through but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue funny or not this movie is not good but had some positive humor what a waste of film and people s money d d 
__label__1 this slick and gritty film consistently delivers it s one of frankenheimer s best and most underrated films and it s easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date and if you are scratching your head thinking but i loved get shorty you need to be punched in the face in my opinion no one captures the feel for leonard s characters better then john glover in 52 pick up the relocation of the story from detroit novel to hollywood film elevates the story s sleaze factor to amazing heights be a man have a few beers and watch this movie for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag rum punch cat chaser city primeval and 52 pick up my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate i also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for dead bang and black sunday 
__label__1 i love the series many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent but such people do exist all too frequently the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well some things never change and we see the good old boys every day there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen and the storybook po white trash are all too familiar aside from the supernatural elements everything else could very well happen in the modern south i somehow think trinity sc must have been in barnwell county 
__label__1 the arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir and how people in it gradually change this movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes it a about bringing out the best in people and kay pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for the actors are outstanding michael nyqvist we know before but frida hallgren was an new and charming acquaintances to me she has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched per moberg does his part as gabriella s husband almost too well he is awful too see one only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well this is a movie that will not leave you untouched if you haven t already seen it do it today 
__label__0 this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager s family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenager s friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenager s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash 
__label__0 it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films i d like to argue that instead of banning challenging controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be stroker ace this film is awful with a capital a it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in quite a feat for for a man with cannonball run ii cop and a half and rent a cop on his cv the wafer thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace reynolds a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle ned beatty the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are lugs jim nabors ace s dim witted pal and pembrook feeney loni anderson a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by ace hal needham the director of this low grade garbage was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases races some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts unlimited but with stroker ace he reaches a career nadir the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair the humour is weak and infantile throughout and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable even the out takes during the closing credits which can be found in all the reynolds needham collaborations are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn t much fun to make stroker ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude 
__label__1 i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite the gameplay is indeed very similar and is very addictive once i d played it a couple of times i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie it s brilliant if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single player game simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc easy to do and the software is included and play to your heart s content there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening because you don t often meant other players unless you want to so go get a copy of this game learn it by playing the single player campaign then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself the depth of this game is staggering with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find as well as all sorts of other things to discover hidden planets wormholes secret bases the list is nearly endless fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay get one with the full written manual if you can blue box not xplosiv red box it s loads better 
__label__0 let s be honest shall we al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus it s a hook make no mistake al gore is a politician three years ago he was busted ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid a yugo or even a gm metro but a lincoln go google it if you like or how about the fact that mr gore his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel guzzling jets to attend the premiers of an inconvenient truth so much for conservation huh al anyway it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at an inconvenient truth discover the main fundamental flaw while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed global warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it for example i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot they can point out an automobile which is not running right but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why generally not a second flaw just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago the toilet wasn t even invented yet what did they have a june bug in a match box hell even 50 60 years ago therefore how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is getting warmer when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best or that man is the sole cause of it the answer is we don t science is never a consensus thirty years ago time magazine did a cover proclaiming a new ice age the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions solar activity el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed global warming finally what al gore fails to adequately address is even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al implement everything he recommends how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can t even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism answer it s wishful thinking mr gore you being a former vp of the usa know it if the folks who produced an inconvenient truth were really honest they would have titled their film al gore wants attention but what i d really like is for someone to ask the former vp this why were two of the planet s biggest polluters aka china india exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords anyway i hear the producers of a i t are working on their next film entitled gnomes fairies elves our endangered friends 
__label__1 the movie aimed at adults is a rare thing these days but moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie which is aging very well although it s comic moments aim lower than the rest of it the movie has a wonderful specificity italians in brooklyn that isn t used to shortchange the characters or the viewers i e mobsters never appear in acomplication it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs i miss these scenes it also beautifully involves older characters the movie takes it s own slight quiet path to a conclusion there isn t a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax cage and cher do very nice work moonstruck invokes old school ethnic workaday new york much like marty except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious 
__label__0 don t bother a little prosciutto could go a long way but all we get is pure ham particularly from dunaway the plot is one of those bumper car episodes the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot gina phillips is actually good but it s hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx s brother s duck soup ah the raven now there s an actor and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly or dr dread who s filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies i m one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end quoth the raven nevermore 
__label__1 this filmfour funded sci fi movie is most definitely a must see while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive despite it being basically a re run of an earlier film it s good to know that films like this are still being made even if they aren t getting wide releases and cypher is refreshing for that reason the plot twists and turns which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher s mystery the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons to him unknown however his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it s apocalyptic imaging of the future this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type with it s only real close affiliate being kubrick s a clockwork orange the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish and more thrilling plot developing you never quite know where you are with the plot which serves in making it all the more intriguing the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy lui northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale and does well with his role lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn t quite fit her talent but she has a look about her that just fits this movie cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole if you want an inventive recent sci fi film cypher is the way to go 
__label__1 cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value michael curtiz at his best lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best a forerunner to the thin man series recommend to everyone did you figure it all out 
__label__1 the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in 1959 this film is a sweet enchanting masterpiece from disney the film has a great soundtrack that s one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after the narration the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when cinderella s animal friends the mice and birds fix up cinderella s birth mother s dress so she could go to the ball until drizella anastasia tore it to bits the b es 
__label__1 this is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe dad they have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something second time through you realize how horribly the sister s husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar he takes it it s the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather in that same scene the sister s blues song is a real tear jerker if you re the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music her performance feels like the climax of the story a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods sc meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies that s cool long as you recognize it as fiction 
__label__1 walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema how do you get laughs out of other people s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since those other races used it undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world an extraordinary dvd extra commentary two of them in fact run thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take what a hoot don t miss it 9 10 stars

__label__0 i ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations i think i paid about 50 for this movie as an eternal fan of horror from cheesy 80s american slashers to european zombie films i told myself this was going to be great i can t tell you how wrong i was first of all i thought it was gonna be pretty much gorier than it actually is after all i ve had heard about this film i was almost scared to watch it the murders are boring the acting forget it there s no acting the story even if we don t care is incredibly bad it seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls but unfortunately in this case it doesn t help the movie why there s no atmosphere and this is the worst thing about this flick it s just bad film making from point a to b though it s extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers don t make any effort to get your hands on it there are so many movies in this world don t waste your time watching necro files

__label__1 it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip basic instinct 2 to the point that a significant part of the audience including critics found it terrible even before it was released it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone who like all of us is now fourteen years older and unlike most of us still looks wonderful first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself in my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend michael caton jones is not paul verhoeven neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas basic instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor even stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish catherine trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick she became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences the rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to end i am not recommending basic instinct 2 as a great movie i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators 
__label__1 since starting to read the book this movie is based on i m having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i ve ever seen it would probably not have mattered i m trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton s book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it it s not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel i m feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it s not so much that some novels don t deserve to be a movie it s more like some books just can t make the transition ms minton s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms minton s work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since i m only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess i m writing this because i feel that if you re going to adapt a novel adapt it but don t make it something else that it s not i m not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else s work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but it s too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are 
__label__0 the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun the good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many holes its laughable where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train erik estrada please and the whole idea hijacking a train how moronic is that the germans know where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away what a waste i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again i mean seriously it felt like it was made in the 60s but it was produced in 88 1988 the a team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie only watch it if you need a good laugh this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne 
__label__0 if you really truly want to waste two hours of your life do the following 1 look through the tv listings 2 find the movie men in white 3 when men in white comes on sit and watch and that s it after sitting through two hours of bad puns dreadful and not that funny movie references and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly why why did i do this i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good it wasn t but on the other hand if you re old enough to remember power rangers you might spot some familiar faces during the film presumably to save on production costs saban who also make power rangers decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone s favourite tacky toy spawning franchise throughout the film i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value but if you want to see actual power rangers monsters go watch power rangers itself it s much better than this piece of garbage and that s saying something 
__label__1 this is the first jean renoir silent film i have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best besides being also his first major work overall it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only renoir s sophomore effort for fans of the director it is full of interesting hints at future renoir movies especially the diary of a chambermaid 1946 and the golden coach 1952 in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her but also the rules of the game 1939 showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters backs are turned away from them and french cancan 1955 nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point personally i would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to g w pabst s pandora s box 1928 josef von sternberg s the blue angel 1930 and max ophuls lola montes 1955 in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan having said all that the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release a mad undertaking as renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which not only personally cost him a fortune he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late father s paintings but almost made him give up the cinema for good stylistically nana is quite different from renoir s sound work and owes a particular debt to erich von stroheim s foolish wives 1922 a film renoir greatly admired and on a personal note one which i really ought to revisit presto having owned the kino dvd of it and the other von stroheims for 4 years now anyway nana is certainly not without its flaws a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences the horse race around the mid point in particular going on too long the overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times particularly that of catherine hessling s nana and raymond guerin catelain s georges hugon one of her various suitors although technically they are being their characters i e a bad actress who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage and an immature weakling respectively however like anna magnani in the golden coach hessling renoir s wife at the time by the way is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as the epitome of elegance as another admirer describes her at one stage who is able to enslave every man she meets other notables in the cast are dr caligari himself werner krauss as nana s most fervent devotee count muffat jean angelo as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of nana s and future distinguished film director claude autant lara billed as claude moore and also serving as art director here as muffat s close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latter s neglected wife the print i watched via lionsgate s jean renoir 3 disc collector s edition is for the most part a lovingly restored and beautifully tinted one which had been previously available only on french dvd being based on a classic of french literature by emile zola no less it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are dorothy arzner s in 1934 with anna sten and lionel atwill and which i own on vhs and christian jaque s in 1955 with martine carol and charles boyer which i am not familiar with 
__label__0 this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn t be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don t feel that i missed a thing 
__label__1 i had never read shakespeare s hamlet before watching it but i did have a shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it my view on the movie may be partially biased since i had never read the play before but i got pulled into this movie s grasp shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements but now on to the movie i found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus were able to articulate it quite well leonardo in romeo and juliet is nothing compared to kenneth branagh and the king the thing i liked about this was that it worked very well as a movie and not as a play you are studying you don t need to be affluent with shakespeare to relate to all the misery hamlet has to go through i would recommend this movie to a wide audience that s my two cents 
__label__0 this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesn t even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she s more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie i m sure the topless girls doesn t hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didn t like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i don t recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i can t think of any part of the movie that was good 
__label__0 i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only 12 years old i recently re watched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee majors chris makepeace watch my bodyguard 1980 if you would like to see a good movie that he was in of meatballs also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role does did nothing for their careers anyway lee majors character franklyn hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to california one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation i thought the concept was ok not the worse i ve heard of but the execution failed horribly 
__label__0 i was not entirely impressed by this film it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film i m not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it it was very slow and what was with picking robocop peter weller as one of the main actors that was a sad point all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don t expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out 
__label__0 warning this review will reveal the ending of the movie scoop if you don t want to know how the movie ends don t read this review scoop is so bad you ll think annie hall was a fluke it gets one star because you get to see hugh jackman s naked chest that s the only thing scoop has going for it woody allen s misogyny and his fixation on women young enough at this point to be his granddaughter has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point the plot seems promising a ghost ian mcshane directs a fluffy headed student scarlett johansson to investigate whether or not an english lord hugh jackman is the notorious tarot card killer of prostitutes a magician woody allen helps the girl promising plot notwithstanding the movie completely lacks charm or humor or atmosphere it s an amazingly leaden amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film never mind dozens perhaps allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films woody allen now a septuagenarian has finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl not so in fact the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one there is an early scene where johansson for no reason central to the movie allows herself to be gotten drunk and seduced by a powerful older director seduced is a euphemism for what happens it s a slam bam i ve gotta go kind of moment it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever and it cheapens johansson in the viewer s eye why did allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie because it shows a powerful director like allen having sex with the female lead allen gets to have his cake and eat it too johansson is not yet an actress she doesn t know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight low cut top she imitates allen in a couple of scenes and that just looks weird and sad it doesn t help that her character is scripted as a doll who can t function without a ghost or an elderly and less than awe inspiring magician telling her what to do at every turn she is approximately half jackman s age and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines and jackman deserves better too a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency and an actress who can convey those qualities hugh jackman is similarly cheated by the script allen apparently can t stand it that jackman is so stunningly good looking and young and so he gives jackman nothing to say or do like johansson he is used merely for his good looks this is a shame because as jackman has shown in any number of productions from oklahoma to x men he can act here s the big plot twist jackman suave charming english lord really is a killer so though the movie says it is all about letting someone else other than allen get the girl she doesn t get anyone jackman the man she s been making love to is a man who murdered a prostitute nice woody nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp in a passive aggressive touch allen deprives his heroine of his own presence as well killing off his character the magician leaving scarlett johansson all alone at the end of the film a final note at my screening not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy 
__label__1 this film surprised me a little i watch a lot of horror sci fi films and this is a straight to video release that caught me off guard a little i believe this is full moon s best movie thus far and one of jeffrey combs best performances good movie 
__label__0 one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50 s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon we re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but it s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever however the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them i m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that 
__label__0 how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me the only actor who is at all known to me is judge reinhold an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production i don t even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment a car travelling along the freeway with police in tow and no one knows how to stop the car yeah right the script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton most made for tv movies are awful but this redefines the word check out the acting skills of the bridge operator pure oscar material 
__label__0 as with many other pop culture franchise series this line just didn t know when to quit instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark this movie should never have happened it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same after the wonderful experience which was the omen this was a major disappointment which stank of 70 s cheese and horrible acting it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over it rates a 1 4 10 from the fiend 
__label__0 i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple 4 samoan guys wreck weddings so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding yawn the thing that peeved me off the most was the so called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clichéd and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot all in all one of the worse movies i ve seen of 2006 unfunny bad acting just ugly well thank god a friend shouted me avoid 
__label__1  presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching it s a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything it s almost too realistic as there s little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch 
__label__0 this film was the recipient of the 1990 academy award for best animated short film over the last few weeks i have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and i really think that this film might just be the worst of them all yet it wasn t just a nominee but it won i assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre the film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super skinny uncle festers the appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation all are identical with the same faces bodies and clothes the only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs they are all standing on a large platform that is suspended as if by magic in space each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform the platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform this goes on and on and on and on for the longest time the only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end but it just isn t enough to make this fun to watch in the least aside from passable stop motion animation this short offers nothing of interest to me nothing by the way the great short knick knack also came out in 1989 and i have no idea why it was not among the nominees it was a great short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before perhaps pixar s success in previous years resulted in a bias against them but knick knack is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it could pixar have not entered it this seems unlikely 
__label__1 i saw this movie today and i have to say it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it but it did totally change my idea the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it this really touched me and as a film which is based on a true story it convinced me a new school psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn t seem to work out it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations also i think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened before i spoil this movie with praises i have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn t look and feel realistic like the one where the headmaster of the school beat frits aka martin in front of the class at the end of the movie he really got beaten badly but the only thing that it caused to him was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning when frits got some stitches well i guess every movie has it own faults have to say that if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store it s sure thing that i take it with me 
__label__1 i loved this movie great storyline and actors and good movie sets it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack i can not find it anywhere please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating swayze did a great job i think this is some of his best work his past movies were ok but this one really told a story for a change this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work 
__label__1 most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air force in which a b 17 nearly single handedly takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departure scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true 
__label__0  may contain spoilers i bent over backwards to be fair to this film i knew it starred madonna i knew it lasted a whole week in theaters i knew it got a lot of bad reviews i wasn t expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class culture and sexuality like we got in the italian original the benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes madonna plays a rich pretentious nit witted gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends the brunette woman is as bad as madonna exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions adriano giannini plays the ship s first mate who the madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together why is she such a bitch to him simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two thirds of the movie swept away is a silly simplistic superficial movie from beginning to end madonna gives a typically wooden performance there are many dumb scenes madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of giannini a fantasy scene with madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt guy ritchie does his stylish editing which is laughable here the film contains some of the worst dialog i ve heard in a major movie in several years the ending is sappy and implausible it s basically the blue lagoon meets overboard minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter maybe madonna s ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress please give it up madge for our sake as well as yours this isn t her worst movie though that distinction still belongs to shanghai surprise she hasn t made anything worse than that yet 
__label__1  moonstruck is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller norman jewison in the heat of the night fiddler on the roof the hurricane the film is great on many levels it shows a good slice of italian culture has a touching romance and best of all is a hilarious comedy one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film and cher well cher always looks a little odd overall it s a fun film and easy to recommend 7 4 out of 10
__label__0 i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part since i am a filmmaker i give it a 2 for consistency the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that information it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged the actors weren t bad but the plot needs more innovation 
__label__1 can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt allende s novel obviously yes bille august managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total incoherency i can t believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing and this something was the most important part 
__label__1 the ruth snyder judd gray murder in 1927 inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal more famously it inspired james m cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with double indemnity and the postman always rings twice both became film noir classics of the 1940 s double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made some of the real life elements of the snyder gray story were captured by cain the old age and indifference of albert gray ruth s high sex drive ruth and judd s passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase cain s double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder let s ignore stanwyck s ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore the postman always rings twice however was filmed thrice and ossessione an italian version and luchino visconti s first film was the first of three versions before commenting on it i ll recommend the lana turner john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table ossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice it has a strong neo realist look which makes it a great movie but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing it does not have low key lighting and unconventional camera angles the dialog is not hard boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac a new character is introduced into the story la spagnola with very obvious homosexual overtones there is also a small but very well played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime the drifter is a complete tramp the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage her husband is an obscene capitalist obese rude and arrogant i think the casting was brilliant for this film my only beef is with the overlong running time everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical nevertheless fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione as i did 
__label__0 i don t recall walking out of a movie theater except this once not only that but i was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go an uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point i didn t care when the good guys died i didn t care when the bad guys got it the fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency in short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell 
__label__0 the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine the article made this film look interesting well it isn t this was a very boring amateurishly written and directed movie all the actors in this movie are awful except faye dunaway who is always a joy to watch but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio marzio has such a thick argentinean accent you can only understand every couple of words he says also on hand is nicholas pauls who plays the ultra bland love interest to gina phillips the bottom line this movie is not scary there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie i would have given this one star but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much but even she wasn t that great in this 
__label__1  possible spoiler adam sandler is usually typecast in comedy but in reign gives a deeply moving performance while there are people who showed courage facing post september 11 2001 sandler plays fineman a widower who is lonely and lost in his own world johnson cheadle a practicing dentist encounters his old college buddy sandler and wants to catch up on old times we see as in rain man dustin hoffman fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations oldies music appears to be a comfort and psychological crutch for him to lean on johnson looks for in fineman that certain pleasure and ease missing in his family he also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his job in the same instance he also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social cracks i came away from this movie with a different outlook and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families 
__label__0 now i m one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say hmm this isn t so bad i loved the cable guy and thought that my big fat independent movie was great keep in mind i really didn t start watching this with high hopes but i figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it i was wrong at no point at all during my suffering through this film and i use that term sparingly was i even close to being mildly entertained to start shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting i hate rap music but as far as i could tell an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him the main character is simply annoying and not a character that it s easy to like quite frankly i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus bloody sores than watch this again 
__label__0 when a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie i rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie we couldn t have chosen a worse movie the movie may have been alright with a few changes first off the comedy was painful physical gags were poorly performed and placed the fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love if he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable there were some funny jokes i believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parent s porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn but to best sum up the comedy i will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid he wears a puke stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done to finish off the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickering oh btw there are two good elements that the movie possesses kadeem hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or under appreciated the other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful mrs ali landry her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shame don t waste your time even renting this one it didn t appeal to me and i was part of the target audience 18 male 
__label__1 this really is an incredible film not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and self determination chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before and in the cross hairs we see the usa once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality it s heart breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we re witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience these irish film makers deserve our gratitude long live chavez we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a great job of doing just that 
__label__1 i now that these days some people wan t see a movie without movie styling so much dogma lars von watchosky brothers are changed what we expect in a movie perhaps casomai is no one more independent non american movie the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage but much more fully of views lectures and let you thinking and i m sure you can t fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes i calculate that don t have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1 2 minutes 
__label__1 if you like cb4 you have no idea what you re missing if you haven t seen this film yet this movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody i ve ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old school performers definitley rent this movie there aren t that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed

__label__1 the best film on the battle of san antonio texas in march 1836 was john wayne s 1960 epic the alamo in a one shot job as director producer that temporarily financially strapped him wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon like acting ability personifying the west i have commented on that film in a review the other night and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant the screenwriter tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle they did bring in the issue of slavery they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett bowie travis austin and houston but there was one weakness though well hidden in the film wayne worked hard to cast it properly thinking of many people for lead roles in it but he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces general antonio de santa anna the role was played by an obscure actor ruben padilla on this board his thread shows only three credits listed padilla did not have any spoken dialog even in spanish and while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent tyrant observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie the alamo thirteen days to clory it is the best film in showing the man who was from 1836 to 1854 a leading bogeyman to american policy makers raul julia was a wonderful stage actor i was fortunate to see him in a production in the late 1980s of arms and the man in manhattan as sergius he was never boring and usually first rate in his acting here we see the egotistical monster at his worst nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna s wishes or activities it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough or it can be the temerity of these foreign brigands as he saw the americans in not knuckling down to himself the napoleon of the west santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country s constitution but it was the power that kept him going year after year it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves and thus he sounds like gilbert roland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back his policies were disasters while we know about his attack on texas to put down a revolt there he also tried to expand into guatamala and probably saw himself controlling much of central america he did win at the alamo but at great cost of lives his massacre of col fannin s men at goliad was inexcusable one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last but fannin had surrendered then came the disaster of san jacinto where his army was wiped out he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops he was captured and humiliated and forced to sign a surrender of texas houston was kind to him the troops wanted to string him up except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars he repudiated the forced surrender of texas but could not militarily undue it instead he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 48 against the americans leading to the mexican session the u s was decent enough to pay mexico 15 000 000 for the southwest but mexico lost half of it s territory he would be president for the last time in 1853 in time to give franklin pierce s horrendously bad administration it s one moment of glory santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico the gadsden purchase to the u s no other mexican president not even porfirio diaz ever cost his country so much diaz did sell out to foreign business interests but he built up mexico s economic muscles doing so he was exiled in 1855 and settled in staten island there he managed to do his most creative work he introduced chicle to the u s and it became chewing gum some achievement julia s santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america s best land purchase agent he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment s notice most of the time his chief aide col black david ogden stiers here a british born officer holds his tongue he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss at the end when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like and they did

__label__0 this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a bad thing that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts all that s missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking where d you hear that or that can t possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless em the regular folks in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it s a condition shared by the movie s rock stars as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i ve enjoyed and i m sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor nash seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can t possibly believe the things he s being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever stand and fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they re not being patronizing nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn t mean much to them at all it s worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the 70s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one it s worth noting because that s symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly life or death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they re playing the catskills except maybe gil scott heron his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high schooler impressed with how controversial he s being only bruce springsteen s performance raises a pulse i ve never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely smokes no question part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general blandness and air of self satisfaction here it s no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rock n roll but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting i don t expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second cutaways to a back up singer s tonsils now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch rust never sleeps or the last waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians so really there s only two things to watch this movie for springsteen s stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter culture in decline 
__label__0 at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first 10 minutes you don t notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about 20 minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn t busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor s talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don t realize that it s the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the morpheus character dies the only good thing about the movie he utters a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn t get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie 
__label__0 one richard pryor and jackie gleason two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid they ve both sold themselves out in this one worse than pryor s character two horrible overly sentimental script that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched three choice of a black actor as the toy the racial subtext of this is unbearable as its never addressed there s no message here pryor s part could have been played by any comedic actor four that kid i wish i could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting that would mean movies like this one and kid co might not have been made and my childhood would have been free of their mind warping power so if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick go ahead if you want to see them in something good see pryor s old standup act and gleason in something better like the honeymooners 
__label__0 the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released superchick which was first released in 1973 now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film despite the superwoman connotation superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the 1970 s was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year s time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4 10 
__label__1 the pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes absolutely incredible sword moves and martial art show off a true john woo masterpiece the story tends to be a bit week though but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action if you are into martial art movies you are going to love this one 
__label__0 i wonder how the actors acted in this movie annette bening was really herself half in and half out was she faking or being natural it didn t make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film brian cox acted really well i almost thought that he had always acted this way tricky dishonest in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene as for gwyneth paltrow the question is what she was doing in this film this film is quite sickening and disgusting who would pay to see such a crap 
__label__0 originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town they aren t allowed phone calls and nobody knows they re there what follows is rape torture beatings humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down the unrated version is even worse there s plentiful nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her yuck there s nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded all this is shoved in your face like you re supposed to enjoy it the needlessly downbeat ending doesn t help i m giving it a 3 because the acting is good but that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick sleazy film not recommended 
__label__0 with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there aren t many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasn t an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to it s full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be skipped completely 
__label__0 knowing enki bilal s comics for quite some time i had to see this movie i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend and i thought i will enjoy watching it i was wrong the movie was a true torture to watch the idea has potential but movie leaves way too much to be desired and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not chances are if you re reading these pages that you have already seen it or that you re gonna see it but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes 
__label__0 i m glad the folks at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i wasn t sure for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour right up until the ridiculous twist ending which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is it is hard to describe just how amateurish the hazing really is did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack jawed disbelief at how terrible it is 
__label__0  proximity tells of a convict lowe who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him this very ordinary film is an action drama with a weak plot stereotypical poorly developed characters and a one dimensional performance by lowe a forgettable film not worthy of further commentary 
__label__0 this movie is possibly the cheapest cheesiest and poorest sequel ever made yet it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by disney and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish it s a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions spoiler alert the first one s all about beast and belle being petty over a pathetic argument then three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to belle part way through this little episode belle has wall eyes which made my siblings and i laugh so hard then she and the beast fight more over the letter and later learn the meaning of forgiveness how old are they certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness then the next one s all about lumiere being the world s biggest dope when it comes to romance this coming from the man who could woo anything female and they make fifi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill belle and winds up getting off scotch free by the end of it what a message to send the kids then the next one s all about mrs potts being angsty and the next one after that s all about beast becoming overly possessive of a bird to the point where he just seems downright silly the animation s so ugly it kills there are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see and the coloring is awful belle s a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong plus she s petty and very different from the usual belle and the side characters are annoying i mean cogsworth and lumiere fight almost all the time i know they did that in the movie but it was overdone in this but the worst character is mrs potts she s ruined in this i can t even describe it just buy it and see for yourself i give it a 1 10 for the sap but i give it a 10 10 for comedy 
__label__1 i can remember this movie from when i was a small child i loved it then and i still do now i managed to get it on dvd for my 18th birthday and was over joyed because i had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger my favourite character is charlie because he learns to be a good dog the movie is filled with fun songs and music the animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect this movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think that if i hadn t seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as i do although i still believe that i would still like it because i am really into animated movies 
__label__0 this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn t even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie jim nabors is wasted the other actors aren t given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours stroker ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it 
__label__0 as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had scotty nyugen in it basically scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn t one i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn t have wasted 16 buying it off ebay take it from me avoid like 7 2 offsuit dire :(
__label__0 i am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film do not read further here it comes avert your eyes the main heroine the girl who always survives in other slasher films is murdered here there i just saved you 79 minutes of your life this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the 80 s despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk both priests and college students get a bad rap here they are pictured as oversexed sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life and the college students come off even worse splatter university is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape that would be more entertaining this is rated r for strong physical violence gore profanity very brief female nudity and sexual references

__label__1 small spoilers alert good movie very good movie and i m surprised to say that myself because i m not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director s name deran serafian usually means bad news most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action this movie really fascinated me good accomplishment seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved it really is the story that keeps you focused especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle of course that s where the reality and the based on a true story stops the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker in this movie the count vlad teppish emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman and they re all pretty girls i ll give him that overall good acting by unknown faces enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr heck it s a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title these two films have nothing else in common but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture check it out my humble opinion on to die for 8 5 10
__label__0 slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrong very wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad it s just plain stupid everything about it especially the killer s origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie savvy characters i m so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally 
__label__1 this one is considered a key pre code film from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story 1946 but also the paranoid sci fi invasion u s a 1952 and features one of barbara stanwyck s best early roles she s supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day george brent douglass dumbrille edward van sloan nat pendleton and john wayne at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter robert barrat as stanwyck s father donald cook as her most tragic conquest alphonse ethier as her elderly mentor more on this later arthur hohl as a lecherous politician and henry kolker as cook s boss and father in law whom stanwyck also seduces curiously scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors abetted by crackling i e typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual ethier stanwyck complains to him early on that she s no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy directed by howard hawks and co starring gary cooper of that name under ethier s auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she s eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one relating to an ambitious statesman s lust for power in sergei eisenstein s october 1927 sociologically it s also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companion the first two thirds of the film are simply terrific at first i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced george brent character while he ignores her but just like the others he s soon under her spell on second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring as it s evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as it s possible released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection the film is presented in two strikingly different edits a recently unearthed pre release version and the tamer theatrical release print among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck s life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it s heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been shortened i e censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only brent appears in the version released to theaters etc tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the pre release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which basically has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche 
__label__0 this could well be the worst film i ve ever seen despite what mikshelt claims this movie isn t even close to being historically accurate it starts badly and then it s all downhill from there we have hitler s father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that he d married his niece they were in fact second cousins hitler s mother klara called his father alois uncle because alois had been adopted and raised by klara s grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew alois was much older than klara and so as a child she d got into the habit of calling alois uncle the scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers we see hitler chase the dog through the trench when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors and every last one we are told is killed outright how then if hitler was the only person to survive the scene did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told did hitler himself go around boasting about it i don t think so next up hitler bullies and intimidates a poor stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop because i m certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce all the grotesque clichés are here not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagner s music upon the little man if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side then they might have discovered that franz lehar s merry widow was more likely to float the fuhrer s boat than any flying dutchman from the cannon of richard wagner hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music i could go on but i d be at it for hours give it a miss 
__label__1 i am black american and i loved this soap opera i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo almost 5 7 years ago the story was a true story about a black slave who s love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of living a lot of us could learn a lot from xica she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities many would argue that she sold herself out but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children it was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but it s not being released this soap opera was the best soap opera ever we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again it s playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable we need it released again to telemundo 
__label__1 i am from sweden and i have just seen this movie and the thing is that i thought it was okay i have seen many bad comments about it but you must remember that a lot of people that watch this two parts miniseries are located all over the world and not just in usa also remember that not everyone has ever heard of the film made in the 60 s and maybe not in the events murders and even more that it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that doesn t like black white films this one feels fresh and in color and will find its public its 12 years old now but i just saw it for the first time i will try to find the first one if i can to compare them but i haven t seen it anywhere in sweden ofcorse there is internet but not for anyone in the world the thing here is that this is mostly part of an american crime history and was big in the 50 60 s in just usa but in rest of the world it just past by i guess well it was told about for some time but 40 years later it will fade away in for example europa cause time goes by we had our own problems and crimes so if someone will do a remake of the film and put it back in some light again its not a bad idea at all a new generation can take part of this horrible story and even the film about capote that was released just a few years ago witch was a pretty good film too i think it will boost interest to the events that took place some 50 years ago and maybe stop it to fall in sleep it started me up and now i am looking for the robert blake version so it wasn t that bad huh this are my opinions some people will of course disagree but hey its okay sometimes there will be okay with remakes on old films its not every time the old ones are that good the film making techniques has developed a lot and scenes can be made more realistic if they want today its always a question of money of course there has been so many movies that were made in the good old days but there were also money missing bad directors etc and they remakes them today 50 years later and suddenly they are okay to watch my friend got this box of old classic horror movies and s f and i cant say i was impressed of the so called good old days most of them you cold put in the trashcan directly they were so bad that we just sat there like zombies could not move like brain dead i cant recommend them to anyone some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking them but not the originals they were just painful awful this is like the old story of who was the best bond moore or connery i think if you see roger moore first you maybe find him the one to trust or like thanks for me and i am sorry for my english thats not so good lars from sweden
__label__0 the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but can t say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just don t see jon bon jovi as a bad ass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldn t mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen 
__label__0 i couldn t help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon a massively more amazing film when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea this could have been a great film the acting is from some of the actors alright from others it s downright horrible that aside the idea is great and the format is great the story is pretty good as well though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind nevermind that though right it is a horror movie after all i really want to see this remade i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be however and you can t really fault the minds behind the movie for this this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget and the fx really hurt the film overall great movie if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx whoever wrote it should keep going though great idea here 
__label__0 basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns watching the detectives has none of that the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads not to mention the lack of any real visual story telling style i mean this film is centered around movies yet is itself incredibly uncinematic that s a major failing right there but the main problem is we simply don t care about the main characters because the script and the actors murphy and liu fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem well not terribly interesting oh yeah another thing for a romantic comedy it s not funny and the romance isn t terribly romantic either so avoid it even at its 90 something minute running time it s just not worth sitting through 
__label__1 fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film it has all the pieces of acting direction storyline and entertainment value they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece fay grim this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry s these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings fay is sent to find these journals in return to release her brother from prison and is sent on a cat and mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies posey made me believe what was happening on screen i felt for her i rooted for her and i wanted to know more she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can t stop thinking about what is happening to her i haven t seen any other previous works by writer director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i d highly urge you to choose fay grim if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely 
__label__0 the cast is ok the script is awkward at times and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war i guess we were supposed to not notice it we did its a house you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes the shower part huh what was that about literally it is i have a client ok you can use our shower yawn the angles are trying way to hard there was a set of woods suddenly its gone cause you can see right through then next it is deep and animals are dying in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions 
__label__0  paula i may be a bitch but i ll never be a butch a hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in stacey walker but that s about all this gal s a real tease who lures her boyfriends co workers and even her lesbian roommate paula into her bedroom but then turns into a whack job who cries rape and calls for the police the schizophrenic personality of this certified c t is interesting for maybe a little while but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one note affair at least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time 
__label__0 as i was watching this movie i was thinking ok it ll get good any moment i was wrong the real best part of this movie was when it was over a complete waste of 92 minutes all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn t really even see him that good and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo for the creature to be so bad you definitely couldn t tell it by this movie 
__label__1 although dig was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post 98 and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands 
__label__1 every country which has a working film industry has some sane and maybe some insane artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you re a part of this country i guess hundstage is such a movie you see the lowest level of austria s society dirty disturbed weird hateful but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them normal because they re doing it through their whole life from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austria s art movies but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society a society that is going more insane from day to day creating their own rules that nobody else can understand cave the social system from within and you see the people sitting in the park standing at the opposite street corner queuing in the same line maybe you meet em in a bar or a disco you may visit maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house you start to hate them without exactly knowing why you ll try to get away but you cannot maybe you ll end up like them but it seems normal for you because you re doing it through your whole life now life isn t so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world it has beautiful people but some are also ugly there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so far a very pessimistic movie 
__label__1 this is best comedy i ever seen but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie overall one of best film i ever seen vachtangi benjamin and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili father germogel is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia sergo zakariadze sofiko chiaureli verikoan djafaridze sesilia takaishvili dodo abashidze they all are stars in georgian cinematography plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie:) :) :)
__label__0 i am from the dallas fort worth area and lived in arlington for a few years this movie was way off as far as making it look like arlington i saw mountains in the background of one scene texas doesn t have mountains i guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in texas is filmed in canada the accents are also really bad they should have gotten actors from texas to play the parts there a lot of aspiring actors from texas out in hollywood the movie is really sad though because it is a true story i pray that the killer is found and convicted the one good thing is that bc of her death we now have the amber alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted 
__label__0 this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking through the jungle up a rocky cliff near a river or lake to pad out the running time the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras for a zombie cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didn t see an uncut version 
__label__1 this is very dated but that s part of the charm with this 1933 movie you can say the same for most pre code films they re just different and usually in an interesting way it was the short running time the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young s character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy but intriguing film you d be hard pressed to find a nicer girl than trinna played by the 20 year old young who was already into making her 50th movie she started acting as a small child that and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days the camera although in soft focus throughout much of the film zoomed in on loretta s face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life tracy s bill slowly transformed into a loving man thanks to trinna spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting although they have small roles supporting actors walter connolly marjorie rambeau arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75 minute film i was particularly fascinated with connolly s role as the minister father figure of the camp the story is a little far fetched but hey that s the movies this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a hooverville type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale 
__label__1 i felt a great joy after seeing this film not because it is a master piece but because it convinced me of that the portuguese cinema became really very good we can see here the best portuguese actores in this field 
__label__1 i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging congratulations i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it congratulations again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy and when you get to the final scene well what can i say 
__label__0  but this just isn t working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good on what grounds there are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self indulgent and unconvincing lynch s movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that there is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc but this is dull and yes pointless because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far fetched or simply told before in a superior manner it s just lynch exploring dv nothing more so it should be treated like this 1 10
__label__0 ok the portrayal of the stereotyped indians in this story is just plain wrong i do agree that elvis looks rather good here but yeah his skin color does seem to change during the movie i was thinking ok he was never that tan in real life it s some of the most obvious brown indian makeup that i have ever seen it s as bad as the indians on f troop and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans this movie is o k but typically lame story and mediocre songs like in all of elvis later films he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible i keep thinking thank god that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out it is cool to see character actors joan blondell katy jurado l q jones henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie though burgess meredith s indian makeup is absolutely awful it s the worst of the bunch for sure what were the filmmakers thinking was mr meredith doing this one just for the money or what i do love certain elvis movies though for example love me tender jailhouse rock viva las vegas i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co stars mary tyler moore and ed asner change of habit in which elvis plays an inner city doctor oh well at least elvis made a few good films but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones i ll always love elvis thank you thank you very much 
__label__0 a mummy narrates vignettes about men women and the sex between them huh at the beginning the mummy randomly asks the viewer imagine having sex with this girl imagine having sex with this boy about 37 times while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths later said mods boys pelt mod girls with vegetables if you ignore or fast forward through the mummy s rambling the shorts aren t bad in their own right i found a few of them rather funny my personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed this is one well bizarre movie 
__label__1  der todesking jorg buttgereit s second full length feature film the first one was notorious nekromantik has no central character or characters but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide divided into days of the week it comprises of a series of set pieces each of which featuring the self destruction of a complete stranger yes the production values are low and it s disturbing but in many ways der todesking is extremely effective it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment unlike the other buttgereit s works it isn t very gory but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday episode a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide the last sunday episode is so depressing and full of pain just amazing if you want my opinion 10 out of 10 check out this post modernism shocker disturbing art in the purest form 
__label__0 this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete this movie makes me want to go to the washroom i am not a negative type of guy but man the acting in this flick is no comment the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito brigante and i am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick i still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it 
__label__1 the story is quite original but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too but the actual stealing should ve been more in picture however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see 7 10 
__label__0 prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend it s dramatic it s sappy it s immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife you d probably go oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator you ll get 15 jump scares in this film 2 of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything i d also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me as if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds i m not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film i m saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing you d expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shot with a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons we re left with no reason to support horror this weekend at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review don t let my sacrifice be in vain don t go into the movie 
__label__0 in this sequel bruce is still called billy lo get it bruce billy lo lee no but apart from that that s all it has in common with the other movie billy doesn t seem to be an actor anymore he seems to be in another country he s more like a spy he s the only cast member to return and sadly they kill him off to make way for a new character his brother bobby sadly when bruce dies the movie pretty much dies with him this was extremely poorly made it seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming the footage works for a while it s not too obvious at first but soon bruce is always shown in the dark all the time he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it s not bruce playing the part sadly when he dies the movie changes i can t help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep bruce alive but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as bobby does not appear until billy is dead it s hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and bruce is a hard act to follow so it s hard to now accept bobby as the star bruce is never seen again in this movie i think they should have made this sequel without bruce he has a lame role in this movie people hoping to see a new bruce lee movie will be disappointed to see that although he s given the top billing he only has a featuring role even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit if there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about it s the scene where billy fights in a plant nursery ironically it doesn t even use bruce lee footage mind you they did it more convincingly in no retreat no surrender not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable bruce s girlfriend colleen camp is never mentioned my advice is to turn it off as soon as bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother nothing else in the movie is worth watching i found it really sad to see bruce die i don t see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from enter the dragon this was a cheap way of trying to cash in on bruce s name oddly this and the original are credited in bruce s filmography thankfully so far no one has tried anything like this again 1981 was the year of bruce s last movie appearance it was a sad way to end it but thankfully this is proof that bruce s movie career should be left alone 
__label__0 dieter bohlen germany s notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like you re my heart you re my soul felt the need to tell his story and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer the result was a funny book about his life well more or less a fuzzy image of it he didn t deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself no word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital however it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the german version of american idol especially his unforgettable comments this should be the end of the story really in the hype of the mentioned idol tv show called deutschland sucht den superstar abbreviated dsds somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book the result is dieter der film i have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely none of the gags really hits the point naddel s voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although verona s voice should have done that more obvious childish predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes the content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on bohlen s sloppy idealized memory they could have used this freedom to do almost everything it was supposed to be a satire but they failed the story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all it s no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release the probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of dsds turned out to be a mediocre success with the friendly help of germany s biggest yellow press newspaper bild and the desperate situation for the tv station rtl to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show wetten dass is running on channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television unfortunately watching this movie is a waste of time there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at therefore 2 10
__label__1 i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting the writing was top notch james arness is a great actor and he showed it here brian keith was too old to be davy crockett and can anyone really play davy but fess parker another great actor in this move was raul julia who gave depth to santa anna a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times while some may think the movie was slow paced it captured the battle as it unfolded lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in in this day and age when nobody stands for anything i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time 
__label__0 the animation was good the imagery was good although not totally original however the story was too long way too confusing and over the top dramatic after about an hour i couldn t wait to get it over with with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn t one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it but frankly i ve been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice you ll get way more out of it

__label__0 i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off character s don t seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire i shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something i stopped caring a ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body question 0 out of stars 
__label__1 the lady from shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director orson welles whose last hollywood film this was for many a moon it s a kind of post modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular and it concerns a happy go lucky irish sailor played by welles who falls in with a mysterious lady rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time and her crippled and probably impotent husband played with a brainy malevolent gusto by everett sloan a long sea voyage follows with welles in tow as bodyguard and the plot thickens when sloan s law partner glenn anders turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown a murder plot ensues and all sorts of calamities follow for welles and his employers and at this point the story fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far goes off the deep end and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not by itself possess and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess it s hard to know what welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife but self destruction intervenes as it often does with welles and miss hayworth has never looked less fetching that she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness a quality she does not possess in this picture the director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at o hara the presumably easygoing sailor since welles for all his many gifts was not known as an easy man to work with this is a role that twenty or thirty years later sean connery or robert shaw might have been able to breath life into welles does not the most interesting performance in the movie is glenn anders as grisby sloan s loony treacherous law partner anders works wonders with the part and is photographed to look bizarre while his scenes end on odd sour notes and are often choppily edited but for all this he manages to make grisby s derangement palpable and disturbing and anticipates in a genteel way the more flamboyant method actors of the fifties such as timothy carey there is a question that nags me about this film what was welles trying to say he was a highly talented and intelligent man and tended to make statements in his movies which whether one agrees with his world view or not were brilliantly put forth i think i have an answer or a partial one welles was summing up his movie career he had reached the end of his rope in the hollywood studio system he despised and he knew it the lady from shanghai isn t exactly a nose thumbing at the studio moguls of the day but i suspect that it is in its portrait of amoral rival big shot lawyers read producers expressing welles opinion of the power brokers of hollywood that he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler and he rarely lived in one place for long he was hired by a studio to provide it with a big prestigious film citizen kane which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered this may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film which is to say welles personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony and his inability to deliver the goods as promised the mere fact of him turning up in hollywood like his mere presence in the film could not forestall disasters well beyond his control that he presented himself in the movie as an amiable naive outsider shows a lack of self knowledge on welles part he was much more of an inside player than he let on and i imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life and himself for knowing so much 
__label__1 carlos mencia was excellent this is hour special he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal i know people have said he s stolen material in this special but that is not true carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it not how anyone else wants it that is why he is so good people say he s not funny because he says dee dee dee too much and they still haven t realized thats part of his act and they don t want it that way but he brings it like that anyway and succeeds in making people laugh for all the haters out there here is a message carlos is here to stay you have no point in trying to bring him down 
__label__0 there isn t much to say about this film it is horrible the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolf s is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there cgi is something you wouldn t like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomit the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth renting just stay away of this 
__label__1 this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites the voices for the animals are wonderful sally field and michael j fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch but the real standout is don ameche as the old faithful golden retriever this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry happy tears 
__label__1 i found about the movie holes by hearing from people that it wasn t typical disney that both kids and adults both got into the story folks let me tell you i wasn t disappointed holes is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives it was a very interesting unique different and funny story i didn t know quite what to expect when i watched it it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr sir now that i ve seen the movie i have to read the book most recommended 
__label__0 i might not have been the biggest blair witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort so i was looking forward to altered especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various imdb comments unique intelligent a future cult classic and so on you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort because alas altered is a poor weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect the silliness is not funny the horror and gore is not scary and whatever thinking aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there s certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess ok so we know nothing stands out is it at least bearable is the experience worthwhile in any way unfortunately no for starters get very poor acting it s not a stretch to say most b movies these days feature better acting the plot boring and messy dialogs many amateurs actually do better it s really the direction that puzzles i did not expect major improvements over blair witch but at least small steps forward instead our director seems to have worsen over time completely oblivious to previous experiences if there is a major flaw in altered it s the main set a major part of the plot takes place in a single location where the main characters are confined but sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever considering that in blair witch the forest plays a major part and is as much a character an antagonist if you will as the three students you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here but no this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details there s nothing salvageable here die hard fans of blair witch are better off following daniel myrick although his output is far from being golden it shows better structure than sánchez and some lessons from blair witch are applied unfortunately in weak stories but still 
__label__0 heavily re edited and often confusing the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven t made it any better this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer with scott glenn s bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12 year old charge the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family an interesting cast joe pesci brooke adams danny aiello jonathan pryce have all done better the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott s exceptionally fine score part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard makes a positive impression one case where the remake made by tony scott the original choice of director for this version is an improvement 
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i ve ever encountered but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted as far as pure film making technique goes this director is competent he s held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera but the actual editing camera angles camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional i ve seen many movies where the directing was much worse at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there also the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go as far as artistic merit there is none the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film this is pure trash total garbage the gore is decent for a film in this budget range it s obviously fake but there s lot s of it and it s very outlandish i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing this was a good idea and it s the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film unfortunately it s overdone especially towards the end it s really a terrible film but i have to recommend it for it s camp value it s really hard to find a movie that s worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category 
__label__0 there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they ve been glued in place nothing looks rehearsed the film quality is terrible most of the action takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between actors as they deliver their lines no tripod and no proper microphone either there sound quality is terrible even manos fares better than this at least they had proper equipment what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess stick to home videos preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy s new camera phone you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this 
__label__1 i ve seen a slew of 80s rocker horrors over the years from rubbish like terror on tour to ridiculously fun gems like slumber party massacre 2 somehow i managed to keep putting this one off which is strange because it s probably the most popular and well received one well i finally caught up with it and it s easily the best of this mostly awful but almost always endearing subgenre the plot which was pretty much lifted in the film black roses concerns a mulleted misfit named eddie whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music he loves 80s metal especially his idol sammi curr played by the late great tony fields after sammi is killed eddie favorite radio dj gives him sammi s final recording once eddie plays the record backwards he discovers he s a bit tougher and bad things start happening to those who taunt him is sammi s music possessed trick or treat is well made and a total hoot the special effects are awesome even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams i grew up in the 80s and while i wasn t a fan of heavy metal i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan worshipping haha i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and ozzy worshipped satan so it s very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a anti rock priest if only i had seen this film as a kid while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal the viewer never really finds out why sammi curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way this is movie s weakest point but if you can overlook that it s loads of fun 
__label__0 this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it s atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn t bother me so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it s miserably forgettable the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja 
__label__0 written and acted by sincere amateurs produced by some exploitation monger this is dull and hard to watch not the worst movie ever but at least schlock like _plan 9 from outer space_ usually had a real actor or two i d recommend _a thief in the night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists i m neither don t believe me watch it for free albeit sourced from poor vhs here http www archive org details thief in the nightrelevant links added mostly to reach imdb s 10 line minimum http en wikipedia org wiki dispensationalism http www dvdtalk com reviews 3199 thief in the night se a 
__label__0 those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent does kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to swallow 1 priyanka cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom and to go from that to living hungry in her in laws garden shed 2 akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man gets bitten by rabified dogs to then just walk off this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the people who made this film by taking my family to see it we left the cinema with a frown please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your waqt 
__label__0 i mean really how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink ball like demonicus out i mean it should never got the green light to begin with the story is repetitive the characters are weak at best there is no real story on tyranus other then he s a bad dude then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending that s right a bad ending demonicus rises the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in then a picture of chimera comes to life cheaply i might add and chases her out then as she is walking home ala funhouse a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her i mean that makes no sense what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies they could have asked me i had better ideas then demonicus thanksgiving turkey 
__label__0 of course flatley is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer but i think michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title feet of flames one really can t resist recommending desenex foot spray to the retiring and clearly ailing flatley i might add that much like that cheering london crowd per review below i too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance hinting that it may be his last live performance flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic london crowd perry seibert all movie guide
__label__1 while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie the supporting cast including matthau fry shalub durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi saks and maher is an additional plus matthau shines as einstein fry is perfect as ryan s clinical fiancé and shalub s line about einstein s gonads is as has been noted one of the highlights of the film the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower this might be considered something of a chick movie but i think everyone will get a kick out of it eight very solid points 
__label__1 in all honesty this series is as much a classic as television goes as the original poem is to the world s literature far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture s defining texts i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy which was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings or poorly cast fashion models in bikinis as in homer s work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical statuary it s a pity it s not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores 
__label__1 ok i didn t know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie but nothing about it really grabbed my attention but when i was looking around in netflix they were advertising this like crazy if i liked goofy scary movies so i figured to just give it a shot i m so glad that i did watch it this was just a great movie it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch like i said it s pleasantville meets night of the living dead it s just a great concept what does happen after a mega zombie attack as we see in another zombie comedy shaun of the dead they have fun by making the zombies left over as handy citizens this is a very overlooked horror comedy movie i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot but it s a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies this radiation still plagues humanity as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead in order to continue living normal lives communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants in the town of willard a housewife helen buys a zombie in spite of her husband bill s zombie phobia their son timmy befriends the zombie naming him fido one day fido s collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor who turns into a zombie timmy kills the zombified neighbor when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor they capture fido and timmy helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing several days later the neighbor s body is found and the murder is traced back to fido who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it it s so silly but a lot of fun billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought no pun intended a lot of life into the character i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed his last words to her were so funny you weren t really nice but you liked flowers so and he buries her in the garden not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend sick disturbing wrong but classic laughs i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaver esquire type of world there still is a lot of gore in the movie so if you do have a chance to see fido take it i promise some good laughs 9 10
__label__1 as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i ve a feeling i ll be watching this again and again for years to come it s got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale 
__label__1 i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen 
__label__0 this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of deewar and on the waterfront will bring home an oscar it turned out to be rookie mistake even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic in the original brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace bollywood must move out of hollywood s shadow if it needs to be taken seriously 
__label__1 i think i read this someplace joe johnston director of the film and also one of the guys who founded industrial light and magic for work on the first star wars film and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie rocket boys i guess was lacking something one day they were messing with a pc program that forms words from other words ie you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words i think the technical term is an anagram anyway they typed in rocket boys and sure enough what comes back is october sky they were shocked to say the least the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around sputnik at first homer jr did not like the idea but he warmed up to it after the movie poster paperback novel came out and took off 
__label__0 this is the biggest flop of 2008 i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it 
__label__1 a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but it s also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it 
__label__1 every time you think you have a handle on deathtrap another plot twist comes along best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one most noted for its on screen kiss between michael caine and christopher reeve which was unfortunately cut from the televised version i saw this movie has a great deal more to recommend it sidney bruhl michael caine is a very unhappy man once a successful playwright his last several plays on broadway have flopped and while his wife myra dyan cannon is nothing but supportive in both the monetary and emotional sense this does little to make sidney feel any better to add insult to injury young playwright clifford anderson christopher reeve has just sent sidney a play to look at it s anderson s first and sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer he jokes to his wife that he should invite anderson over kill him and submit the play as his own she laughs with him at first but when sidney actually invites anderson over for dinner she worries that he may really be putting his scheme into action and her fears just may be justified it s a brilliant script there are twists and turns all through the plot and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end it s the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and keeps you there the entire time an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery the acting is excellent caine gives his usual excellent performance and he does exhibit a knack for playing cultured refined and intellectual men reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who isn t nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems cannon s franticness works well for myra and irene worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic this is a film with an ending you d never expect and repeated watchings help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings an unsung classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which ruffled some sensibilities at the time and that is a real shame 
__label__0 this is not the worst film i have seen of peter greenaway but it is close that dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book this director s films of 3 i have seen i find them all to be miserable like the cook whatever positive cinematic flourishes he displays are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation 
__label__0  dahmer is an interesting film although i wouldn t use horror or thriller do describe it it s more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer who drugged murdered and dismembered his male victims the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and rodney well played by artel kayàru rodney is almost the more interesting character enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer s formative years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer s belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims the roles are well played but the story is thin 
__label__0 one of my sisters friends lent me this game and it is too damn hard it carries the appearance of a kids game but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes to improve your score you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them and i am only up to stage three maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away and it is definately not recommended for kids they will pull their hair out within the hour 
__label__1 i disagree with anyone who done t like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do it s sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didn t have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a 10 and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish s and dreams can come true tear tear i love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i m glad that at least some people liked it 
__label__0 i saw brigadoon on tv last night 12 sept 2009 i am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen the accents were shameful the local children s club would have produced better sets the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film 
__label__0 wow i watched the trailer for this one and though nah this one is not for me i watched my husband and our friend s faces during the trailer and knew this was a boy movie i mean hallo a bunch of chick barmaids that dance another striptease then i started watching it it didn t look all that bad so i carried on watching i watched it right to the end what an awesome movie if anything this is a chick flick these girls have attitude it is really a feel good movie and a bit of a love story really leaves you with a nice feeling basically the story of a small town girl making it big in the city after going through the usual big city c p there have been a couple of these it is almost a new urban legend but it also makes you think of your life and what you have achieved well me anyway i think it is because the whole working in a bar scenario is very familiar not just for me but for many people i know don t trust the trailers for this one it is aimed at bringing the men in 
__label__1 a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him this comes to us from director rob schmidt who made wrong turn a film i have not seen with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting schmidt to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense my apologies to him for my underestimation as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this is only the foundation on which the story revolves once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense i was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of hellraiser in this through the first part of the show i had no idea what they were talking about then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of hellraiser 2 however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than hellraiser 2 some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look i didn t watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that it s confusing the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him he s somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story if you will i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but he s completely unlovable while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i m excited about the washingtonians episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the genre s future but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope this one is a keeper and please bring schmidt back for season 3 
__label__0 all i can say is before watching the movie i did not have a hint indication who annemarie schwarzenbach was or what was her life story and i have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website however all i can say is that the actress jeanette hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status as it is in real after all based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and tehran as well as afghanistan but believe me i am familiar with the area it was all about an arabic desert in morocco turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic i suppose for making a film like this documentary type a thorough research about all these minor elements is mandatory 
__label__1 another in the they don t make em like that category this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean sometimes over the top fun robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings and they really took the roles and ran with them malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories both honors being eminently well deserved they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors but they ve both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here it s kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red blooded heterosexual as he does here but that s more of a personal bias than anything else but that doesn t take away from the movie s overall entertainment value which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable if you re up some night and this movie comes on i d say watch it it s well worth it 
__label__0 when it comes to movies i am generally easily entertained and not very critical but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start i gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it what a waste of some great talent i was very disappointed with this movie as it was not what i expected 
__label__1 he glorified himself as a great supporting actor in glory he proved he was no malcolm in the middle mediocre actor in malcolm x he showed his brotherly love for acting in philadelphia he pulled a slam dunk in he got game he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in the hurricane he provided us effective thespian education in training day and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct denzel washington s directorial debut antwone fisher is the most moving film of the year this tearjerker fish er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the miami dolphins in the 4th quarter against the new england patriots in the last game of the 2002 season unlike that dolphin tragedy antwone fisher possesses an emotional joyous conclusion the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother derek luke s debut performance as antwone is the best admirable acting i have seen by a novice actor in some time now i actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in luke s acting as i have seen in washington s past performances it was like if washington was telling luke la la la luke i am your acting father ok i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away speaking of the great denzel his work as the psychologist was masterful but what can you expect from the acting master d himself antwone fisher was written by no other than antwone fisher himself the emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife s screenplay was of fisher king material i hail to the chief mr washington in catching the right bait in antwone fisher excellent
__label__1 i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war the movie is impressive not least because it actually happened it reminds me of the story of anne frank 
__label__0 home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies it s the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones viva rock vegas in fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling no other movie has made me cringe in pain now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious first off the plot is ridiculous it revolves around a chip in a remote control car that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it dumb stuff the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch i didn t laugh or even so much as smile once rather i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid the bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying the acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious there is not a single good performance here alex d linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they ve been hastily picked off the street and well that s it i can see some people saying man it s for the kids don t dis it man well man kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monsters inc and toy story before even considering getting this out hell even scooby doo and garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this so in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie this was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well no human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see home alone 3 ever it s that bad 0 5 stars
__label__1 just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt barnes he has done it again with thomas beckett if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes great movie even for a girl 
__label__0 this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still can t bring myself to forgive this movie s existence my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them i ve always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if you re a ewan mcgregor fan believe me by skipping this film you haven t missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut 
__label__0 don t get me wrong this is a terrible clichéd film but it is a delight for fans of olivia hussey quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen one poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at i wonder what his ideal woman looks like paris hil slut blockbuster should really establish a sub genre to this type of film as the fatal attraction plot has become a genre unto itself when will blockbuster adopt the adultry section it will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections right this film revolves around olivia hussey who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex wife who looks remarkably like ms hussey this ne er do well proceeds to stalk olivia and thus make her life a living hell i like olivia hussey but i have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses so i really wasn t rooting for olivia to make it out o this stinker alive violence there is a smattering of violence in the film don murray and anthony john denison get involved in a fisticuffs when denison says that he will not stop seeing olivia murray s wife because she is just too good in bed olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round i ll let you watch nudity olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here she has a love scene with anthony john denison and also has a shower scene shot at a distance story we ve seen this plot before a hundred times over and oftentimes done much better the true culprit when trying to decipher why this film was a dud is william riead the man s dialogue is sophomoric and moronic the man has no story telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot these people of the upper strata of society talk like middle school kids with a habit of sleeping during english class i have placed riead on the never to be viewed again list acting the acting wasn t phoned in as the insiders say but was hindered a great deal by riead s juvenile script olivia hussey resorts to calling anthony jonh denison weird and crazy to his face when he begins to stalk her hussey who is still beautiful delivers the best performance here but denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented love crazed stalker don murray was basically just there his character not fleshed out and edward asner a terrific actor when given something with substance is ill used in this film 
__label__0 when i saw this trailer on tv i was surprised in may of 2008 i was at six flags in new jersey and this was showing at a 4 d attraction you know the attraction that the seats move i take it that the version i saw was a shortened version 15 min and also re created to add the motion effects it was a cute movie but that was it it was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a cgi spacewalk seemed a bit well trite i was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk i will say the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute so all in all i would say if you want to bring the younger kids go for it but if you are wanting to take your older kids take them to another movie they will thank you 
__label__1 there s been a spate of recent surfing movies that i seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was the focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60 s greg noll to our current laird hamilton from waimea bay to mavericks to jaws hell i could watch a movie just about laird hamilton one of this generation s great athletes so the rest is just gravy there s loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars in pleasant relaxed and unpretentious fashion of all the surfing movies i ve seen this tells the big wave story the best and i think it s my favorite enjoy 
__label__1 wow what a whirlwind the 30 s is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine especially during the early talkies phase there were movies which are painfully static and dull like dracula with bella lugosi and there were those that just don t give it a rest sometimes in a good way and other times not this is one of the films that don t stop for a minute and that is both a wonder and a pity lloyd bacon who also directed 42nd street must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema for he filled this picture with it there mustn t be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking it s completely crazy i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 or a 6 tops because the pacing was very poor since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn t know what was happening and what to think the characters seemed to just running to and fro places talking about things which didn t interest me and probably no one else i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in 42nd street ruby keeler and 42nd street was a movie whose ending was the best part of it and you know what it happened the same thing with footlight parade the ending is absolutely incredible it has become hands down the most impressive musical i have ever seen the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are believe me something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth the numbers are flawless there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache 
__label__1 regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem la bête of 1975 one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors la bête is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy tale like atmosphere quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise the fact that beastiality of sorts is one of the film s central themes did certainly not help it with the censors but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience pierre de l esperance guy tréjan the head of a french aristocratic family has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin pierre benedetti to marry lucy broadhurst lisbeth hummel the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family due to an old curse mathurin s uncle marcel dalió is strictly against the wedding when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda sirpa lane and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever dream without giving away too much i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film as bizarre as it is la bête is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style settings and cinematography the fever dream like atmosphere is present within and out of dream sequences the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic elegant female nudity ravishing actresses to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting close ups on horses genitalia while having intercourse in either case it is not likely to be forgotten the entire cast of la bête is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters some of which are seriously demented the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast be it lisbeth hummel in the lead finnish actress sirpa lane who sadly died of aids in 1999 as the ancestor in the dream sequences or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film the scenes with the eponymous beast definitely being among them certainly not everybody s cup of tea but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema a true cult gem 
__label__0 almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a gorgeously produced failure until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas it gave me a headache 
__label__0 the movie was ok not bad not good just ok if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far sadly fast and furious 2 also stunk but i d rather see this than ff2 if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you personally i d wait for hbo or blockbuster :)
__label__0 you can tell a lew grade production a mile off distinctly british in style epic in conception peopled by international all star casts usually set in exotic climes it s a formula that grade and his company itc employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s resulting in titles like the eagle has landed firepower and raise the titanic in 1977 grade produced march or die a remarkably old fashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above directed by the usually dependable dick richards who helmed the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier march or die is an unfortunate disappointment a company of foreign legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian general foster gene hackman is sent to morocco shortly after world war 1 their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated francois marneau max von sydow the archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of erfoud but fear an attack from arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group foster is not happy with the assignment he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives this creates ongoing tension between himself and marneau who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible the problems heighten when a beautiful woman named simone picard catherine deneuve tags along with the legionnaires she is hoping to find out what happened to her father a historian abducted by the arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires none more so than gypsy thief marco segrain terence hill a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature things climax with a huge battle at erfoud with swarms of united arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives on paper the star duo of gene hackman and terence hill seem a mismatch hackman is the heavyweight oscar winning character actor hill the handsome but limited italian heart throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen yet bizarrely it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels the film is attractively shot on desert locations but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for maurice jarre s music is uncommonly flat too very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of arabia score it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s it was a genre that peaked in the 30s and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades sadly the gamble doesn t really pay off this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march 
__label__0 stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes piloted by burgess meredith chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades old gasoline sludge driven by lee majors with chris makepeace as the runaway techno wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film 
__label__0 well you might not actually see any women in love in this movie but you ll certainly hear women talking about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plants welcome to the world of d h lawrence where psycho babble reigns supreme and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are spending time with the characters in a d h lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party when i read women in love i so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it but since i couldn t i was hoping they would at least strangle each other alas only one of them dies not by strangulation and i won t spoil it for you by telling which one in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people to give director ken russell his due he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it s possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel he throws out much of the psychological mumbo jumbo that lawrence adored and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields two buck naked men wrestling by firelight and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates yup buck naked again roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass i m not kidding glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as gudrun the more dominant of the two sisters at the story s focus and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear russell s decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified looking cattle oliver reed has one expression an intense glower the whole thing is over written and over directed and it s deliriously campy indeed this vies with mommie dearest as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie i ve ever seen grade d
__label__1 i just saw this at the toronto film festival and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again it is a character driven film and andrew and david are more than up to the task any discussion of the plot might beconsidered spoilers so i ll just say that the storyline is clever the acting is superb and the effects are amazing well filmed and well paced too one of the best films i have seen in ages and very refreshing in this summer of drearymovies it had the audience laughing the whole time see it if you can i particularly liked the candy bar candy bar scene 
__label__1 eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever probably the funniest delirious is the best stand up comedy i ve ever seen and it is a must have for anyone who loves a good laugh i ve watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it i still have side splitting fun this is definitely one for your video library i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much that you will miss half of them delirious is hilarious although there are a lot of funny comedians out there after watching this stand up comedy most of them will seem like second class citizens if you have never seen it get it watch it and you will love it it will make you holler :)
__label__1 eddie izzard is a one in a million comic genius he goes from squirrels to wwii to stonehenge to religion to englebert humperdink and it s absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense get a copy of this now you won t regret it i give this an 11 out of 10 
__label__0  because 99 out of 100 times the producers lied through their teeth or someone else s to get you to rent or buy their mercifully censored shock o rama cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of feeding the masses a possibly well intentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre folks this is not only low budget film making this is very low budget film making by a bunch of people who i m sorry i know they have families who love them will never ever be in variety in any significant fashion this is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin pitcher folks and not just because it s cheap the acting is mediocre but i don t blame the actors they had no direction they had no direction because the script was a half baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling characterization is thin at best no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction have i mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame they are there s no drama no tension no great character moments nothing the whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric commercial breaks and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish syd fields would not be pleased how could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere why would they give it more than a cursory try in this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best now if they were covering something up like their own culpability but feeding the masses never explores such possibilities instead it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and or significance praying its audience won t notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film making equipment did anyone in this film get paid i hope the actors did if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience even zombie fans will find little to gain from feeding the masses the gore is remarkably tame for no budgeters of its rank and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects they re all eminently forgettable in fact knb has nothing to fear even junk like the aussie stillbirth undead was miles ahead of feeding the masses sorry guys back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you 
__label__0 this film was just painful to watch not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations yeah i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours now you all may think i m just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or artistic film making well you d be wrong on both counts i love the works of shakespeare especially the tragedies of romeo and juliet julius caesar macbeth and hamlet and i ve watched plenty of arthouse films such as the surreal and well made eraserhead and fellini s 8 1 2 but this was just over two hours of lost in translation shakespeare way too much nudity i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes but not in every other shot of a movie it was pointless and served nothing for the story and basically just overzealous film making i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be very artistic and was an adaptation of shakespeare s the tempest but this was just an extreme letdown i gave this film a three only because of sir john gielgud s acting presence which far surpassed all of the no names in this film and the cinematography set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion however a lot of this film would ve been better off as just a painting with a scroll of text below it a true disappointment maybe if zeffirelli had been given the director s chair this would ve been much better but this is one audience member s opinion many others may enjoy this far more than me that being said if you can t find this at any nearby video stores it s currently not on dvd don t try to go too far out of your way to find it it s not really worth it 
__label__0 boy oh boy oh golly gee the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom s invisibility they looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie i did not end up loving this movie the attempted steadicam shots were really pathetic as well i mean hey if they had a low budget flick that s fine you can still make a great movie with a low budget but a bad movie and a low budget and effects that makes for a bad combination in this case such a doomed combo created the craptastic film invisible mom if you have kids and your kids have no taste perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one 
__label__0 the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called club 905 owned run by guy johnson andrew parker lead singer dylan sean cook guitar player mike jason mckee plan to tell the other band members bass player london brooke bailey drummer nancy tom olson that they are both going solo their services won t be needed any longer once at the club dylan prepares but mike doesn t show up the gig turns into a disaster then just as the band think things couldn t get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar that all the doors have been locked so they can t get out that they can t trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one by one produced directed by juan a mas the choke is a standard by the numbers teen slasher that really doesn t have anything going for it the script by jessica dolan susannah lowber not too many horror films out there penned by ladies has some surprisingly good character s in it some nifty dialogue but while it s much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it s so slow boring that even a few interesting character s can t come anywhere close to saving it as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used from the isolated location the victims can t escape from the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up a few murders a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like scream 1996 be surprising but doesn t make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically they couldn t have done some of the things they were supposed to to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on even though i don t want to boast i was spot on then there s the fact that the makers of the choke felt that it s audience would be entertained by showing endless well it feels endless while watching it scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious the kill count is low at first they all decide to stick together good idea but then they all just randomly decide to split up go their separate ways bad idea when there s a killer on the loose the pace is lethargic the kill scenes are unimaginative to top it all off the twist ending is poor director mas does alright the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping the gore levels aren t really up to scratch there s some blood splatter a guy with a hole in his chest a few dead bodies someone impaled on some metal poles most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything since the film is about a rock band there s quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible horrible rock songs used on it i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution it s not scary there s no real atmosphere the lack of blood gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look shot in a place called spokane in washington apparently the acting is one of the films strongest points as it s generally pretty good all round i mean no one is going to win an oscar but it ain t half bad the choke is a throughly routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever a criminal lack of blood gore violence nudity dead bodies i mean if a slasher hasn t got any sex or gore then what s the point those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for right 
__label__1 the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in it s proper context 
__label__0 it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before it was absolutely predictable every time the story tried to get a bit twisted every time i awaited something interesting to happen i saw nothing but what i expected like the bread factory opened up another facility because there was not enough bread in two words flat story that has become a cliché bad acting bad special effects only the dumb russian cop vlad was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys the pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid that it made me laugh at him for a moment i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame of a movie it won t get worse because it is not possible d:D
__label__0 wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first filmmaker s attempt at making a pseudo art video to give you a couple of examples 1 david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content blank walls up shots with ceiling in the background 2 david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video camera s hum in fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie unless this is a joke on david s part to force fans search his website for hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny 
__label__0 only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film the rest of us should take a book mp3 player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event this can be best summed up as a blown up tv movie being distributed into theaters children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie 
__label__0 wow this movie sucked big time i heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well and with all the internet hype on this movie i figured what could go wrong however the movie was just plain bad it was boring and the character development was never there space travelers was also a horrible movie if you didn t like that movie there is no way you will like this 
__label__0 this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire s appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don t know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort 
__label__0 what can i say about cruel intentions 2 well i can say in all honesty i will only watch this film again if i am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork orange style the film stars robin dunne no i never heard of him either whose awful impression of ryan phillipe made me cringe throughout in a case of terrible casting dunne attempts and fails to carry off playing a handsome charismatic charmer since the actor is not handsome nor charismatic nor charming the character is left wholly unbelievable amy adams she was in an episode of buffy one time tries to pick up where sarah michelle gellar left off and bring scheming katherine to life however adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera there were two good actors in the film however barry flatman saw 2 saw 3 and mimi rogers mrs kensington in austion powers made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of sebastian and katherine and are the only reason why i rated the film as a 2 not a 1 the film itself is a poor version of the original with such lows as carbon copy s of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film i think that as a tv show it might have worked but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts 
__label__1 halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful creepy and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators such as jason vorhees friday the 13th the miner my bloody valentine and charlie puckett the night brings charlie okay so i got a little obscure there but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre no longer did a monster have to come from king tut s tomb or from dr frankenstein s lab he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia and on the night he came home haddonfield illinois and the viewers would never be the same there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies first is the setting it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe but if trouble starts to brew nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved especially when a heavy breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine along with the setting the movie takes place on halloween the scariest night of the year while most people are carving jack o lanterns michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie boppers besides the setting there is some great acting jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine laurie strode a goody two shoes high schooler who can never seem to find a date however it is donald pleasance as dr sam loomis who really steals the show his portrayal of the good doctor who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all is the stuff of horror legend however it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film once you hear it you will never forget it i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture nowadays they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of in halloween john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers he always seems like he is a part of the shadows and i think that is what makes him so terrifying there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens unbeknownst to them which adds to his creepiness if you think about some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn t even know it unfortunately for our teenagers and fortunately for us horror fans when they find michael he s not looking for candy on this halloween night he s looking for blood finally michael myers himself is a key element to this movie s effectiveness his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life so if you have not seen this movie if there are still some of you out there who haven t or even if you have grab some popcorn turn off every light pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright trick or treat 
__label__1 this movie is why i found this website i couldn t find this movie anywhere else i am so glad we found it here we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it one other poster commented that it is was boring though i must say that it is not especially if you are a horse person you will love this movie the horses are awesome well trained and the movie is well done it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library we will be recommending it to our friends the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times 
__label__1 i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it her dancing was very entertaining i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance the scenery was great too yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful we laughed at the silly kissing scenes but that is what is great about old movies i grew up with her on the munsters and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them i have a large collection of her memorabilia 
__label__1 i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters however i wasn t able to get around to it so finally it hit the shelves and i picked it up not knowing exactly what to expect i plopped the dvd in the player settled in the for an evening of murder and pressed play what followed was one of the more engaging flicks i ve seen in the last couple years some spoilers this is the story of the wonderland murders which led to the seediest parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70 s john holmes val kilmer i was hooked from the beginning and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning and the actual showing of the murders towards the end the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting val kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star and even the beautiful but that s it bosworth was a joy to watch and just for her looks mind you i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was as i mentioned its lack of outright showing the murders it was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you couldn t completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome furthermore the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite they were being beating with lead pipes there s not much more that needs to be said my only real problem was carrie fisher s brief appearence her portrayal of the overly religious figure was i think a bit too cliche of her appearence maybe that person was actually part of the story maybe not but i wasn t sold and for some reason fisher seemed a bit too akward in her portrayal overall an excellent movie worth the watch even if once 8 10

__label__0 if you have seen the sholay of 1975 don t watch this movie if you have not seen the sholay of 1975 go watch it but do not watch this movie this movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of sholay amitabh babban bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn t be burnt if you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character it would still be worth a watch but as insp narsimha mohanlal doesn t do justice to his talent ajay devgan heero is extremely mundane and the only reason i think they cast prashant raj in the role of raj is because he has a striking resemblance to amitabh of his young days sushmita sen carries herself well with grace and make up but the award for the worst performance and any role till date must go to nisha kothari she manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high school drama would would outshine her performance if you have a mortal enemy take him to this movie :)
__label__1 running out of films to rent i picked up freebird i struggled through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see fortunately it really warmed up and i loved the movie quite a bit the second half of the movie had me grinning and laughing the entire time thankfully although there were bits of cgi included they were not overdone or prevalent i would have to say though the actors all have heavy european accents so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor i really loved this movie and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection 
__label__1 this is a gem a real piece of americana for all that this implies if you are self programed to resist life afirming stories just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story no need to nit pick what details were changed to make a compact story chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors and the complex self conflicted bottom line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight the simple minded comments refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off track expose the limitation of the commentator not the writers or the acting this is not for the cynical or the simple minded 
__label__1  the straight story is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named alvin straight who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged dying brother but that s just the basic synapsis this movie is about so much more than that this was richard s farnworth s last role before he died and it s definitely one that he will be remembered for he s a stubborn old man not unlike a lot of the old men that you and i probably know the straight story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives it will reach down and touch some part of you at least if you have a heart it will 
__label__0 facts about national lampoon goes to the movies a k a national lampoon s movie madness 1 the movie is poor even by lampoon s typical standards 2 it s not funny 3 no one goes to see a movie so after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth it s called national lampoon goes to the movies and why it was ever conceived much less actually made it would be like calling austin powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isn t american and he doesn t go to movies none of the characters in lampoon s so called satire are funny and none go see movies which causes a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000 but it isn t this was national lampoon s first film after animal house although you couldn t tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches not a good sign for an 89 minute movie that seems double the length i ve noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed and this little disaster falls under that category it has two separate titles probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982 83 hmm movie madness i ve never heard of this movie before let s rent it and then the realization hey wait a minute this is just national lampoon goes to the movies it was shelved by mgm ua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place you ll manage to find it it s split up into three stories a parody of self enlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutality cop buddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff i m not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped up part ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter don t ask who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only funny line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesn t sound very funny you re right it s not and just imagine it s the highlight of this film part iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but it s extremely over acted only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where he s choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold at least evoked a chuckle or two it s a shame to watch such a cast of semi famous names resort to low standards the writers of each segment clearly believe that they re being very ironic and clever by spoofing so called stereotypes the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones it s easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera the movie isn t funny as i said before i laughed once at only one line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks i like national lampoon s vacation series or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but their recent slew of direct to video bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really fast sad to see a new film called gold diggers is being released with their stamp of approval it s like condemning a film before it even hits theaters maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place distributor this movie is bad it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval that ll teach you not to make something so awful next time forget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month it s so bad that i can t even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up

__label__1 in iran women are not admitted to soccer games officially it s because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience but of course it is about sexism women are lower forms of human beings some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor it s also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression you ll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs good job by director jafar panahi this is in many ways a heroic comedy 
__label__0 i only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and 1 is just too freakin expensive for this this film is probably only notable for 2 things 1 it has a young keanu reeves and 2 it s directed by paul lynch the man who also did promo night now onto the movie it s about a girl named robin played by olivia d abo who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father s life so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy played by keanu robin when not in training works part time along with her mother and stepsister at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather eventually she is chosen to compete overall keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star and it s also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a bootleg the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as it s also not in the movie itself so the cover s obviously photoshopped in any case avoid at all costs unless you re a keanu fanatic i probably won t be hanging to it any longer i m probably gonna give it to the cinema snob who s a great yt critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running 
__label__1 so wonderful so quirky so romantic so italian the film is so feather light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again a kitchen sink world of bakeries and hairdressers and plumbing but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction take your pick they re both faultless let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass 
__label__1 kabei our mother 2008 is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan a real weeper i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix am i glad i did in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film making from the 1940 s and 1950 s that i ve come to love so much such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures the title credits even begin in the same way with the japanese letters characters in red against neutral color burlap material i immediately thought this director loves ozu the same style was used too mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes even a couple of pillow shots as roger ebert calls them the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another the story follows the lives of a japanese family before and during and after world war two the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father a university professor is arrested for anti war sympathies he s never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls but war starts and he s drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell will they ever express their love for one another will he ever return from the war there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress sayuri yoshinaga she s almost a madonna type she s so beautiful big soulful eyes and flawless skin the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is tadanobu asano what a sensitive performance there is no macho in him at all he s gentle and kind i d certainly love to see both of these two in other movies i think i ll check to see what s available for them the two little child actresses are wonderful too the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences with very easy to read english subtitles i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty four eyes 1954 don t miss this film

__label__0 slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember choose life 
__label__0 wow who ever said that edward d wood jr never influenced anybody this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point it makes the violent years look like casablanca santa claus also makes keith richards worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission i ve had nightmares you know waking up and sweating bullets that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being however i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well also if you re looking for the perfect example of a santa satan dichotomy on vhs tape look no further don t check out this movie as i ve been notified the mst3k version is now available move over satan here s santa claus 
__label__1 i hate over long over talky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid 70 s and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you haven t seen it don t miss your chance 
__label__0 i found this film embarrassing to watch i felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if i couldn t pick up the subtleties i needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly having a father who is still an alcoholic i didn t really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such alcoholics true alcoholics are very lonely people inside in my opinion of course they find it hard to communicate something that the main character had no problem with really except he did have a problem saying i love you at one point which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character he was constantly surrounded with people too i felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil i couldn t connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father i felt nothing at all when it had finished just relief it was over kevin mckidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead the clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick mckidd was too old for the teen they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult mckidd on a good note i felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film 
__label__1 yesterday i attended the world premiere of descent at the tribeca film festival in nyc i had a great time it was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my spacer marcus patrick i give the movie 7 5 starts out of a possible 10 stars the movie begins with maya rosario dawson at college you can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on the photography in this film was excellent she meets jared chad faust and they become sweethearts it appears like any other relationship in the beginning the man is in quest of the woman s attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get both played this well very innocent flirtation between the two he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart the apartment is very dreary and dark they eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles this actually reminded me of a dungeon here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her this is a very dark and gritty rape scene this scene is not for the young or weak at heart the rape scene is a little long and hard to take but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex she falls into her own abyss she starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there she is told to go see adrian marcus patrick the first thing i remember about this character is that they say he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving he is actually the one who introduces maya to drugs they begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie the club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise i thought they were well done and i noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience maya is then back in college as a ta and who is in her class jared her rapist you could see the confusion and emotion on maya s face what should i do what do i do next the shots of her face and the emotions are priceless what unfolds next is not actually whats happening she acts interested in jared she appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again i was sitting there saying could this really be happening it wasn t nothing could be farther from the truth she invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up now her apartment is dark and gritty she has him strip down completely he thinks he s going to get lucky she then teases him like any woman can she s caressing him everywhere and he s getting excited note for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity may not be right for the younger viewer she then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him once again the scene is dark gritty and very rough if you are going to see the movie and don t want to know what happens next skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph this is where adrian reenters the picture maya has adrian save her by performing extremely rough male sex with jared she thinks this is the final revenge adrian continues to take all of jared s manhood and strips his dignity to nothing marcus as adrian plays this scene as believable as anyone can he is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen after the movie during a q a session marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and chad maya believes that this revenge will save her but i don t think it does one of the final scenes has a closeup of mays s face and you see a tear roll down her cheek this was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie did she get the revenge she wanted was it as satisfying as she expected in my opinion it does not it only makes matters worse this is an excellent movie will well acted roles and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it i would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age rosario chad and marcus should be commended for jobs well done the directing and photography must also be commended it was a night that i enjoyed 
__label__1 one is tempted to define the genre of gert de graaff s movie as event of the thought following the example of merab mamardashvili the nominal storyline is a certain bart klever s torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination this film monologue originated as a response to fellini s 8 ½ and cost gert de graaff 13 years of work excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary the paradoxical co existence in two different galaxies that of guttenberg and that of maclhuen for some time we are apt to side with the script writer who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality man catholic window washer and together with him we fall into a trap when the author creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma how can one eliminate from the future movie bart klever just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in work we realize that together with the main character we have again been framed really what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one s own name and the day to day care for the young daughter so who is he this bart klever is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like frenhoffer from balzac s masterpiece just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written gert de graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves 
__label__0 i d completely forgotten about this film until now this was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that i have ever seen it s message seemed to be don t teenagers use their imagination they might take games seriously go mad and hurt people i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that d d style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship 
__label__1 it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience shumlin didn t do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art it is however a beautiful movie i have loved it since local channels used to show it graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories many love the fallen idol but i am not among them i think i saw brighton rock once many years ago and liked it but maybe i m simply thinking fondly of the novel this is superbly cast charles boyer does not it s true come across as spanish but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character tired wary caring lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him but the supporting players are the best katina paxinou is excellent her performance is a little grand guignol but i attribute that to the director peter lorre whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto like universal language is excellent as always and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart she comes across as a precocious early teenager the character wants to be helpful she does her best i recommend this movie highly not without reservations the reservation is primarily that it is a little stolid but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered 
__label__1 this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients but somewhere along the way they didn t quite come together i don t know who made it but it has a slightly disney esque feel while parts of it are improbable like when a pre teen runs for a public office and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously there is a healthy dose of normalcy whatever that is to keep things balanced and in perspective the acting is alright strangely the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit off it s interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend her grandmother and her two passions ballet and baseball being a baseball player myself it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces i read somewhere that she isn t really ballerina but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful overall it was a good film about honesty and ambition but its star mischa barton didn t quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in lawn dogs lost and delirious and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in the 6th sense 
__label__0 short version seed isn t worthless it s just derivative and inferior and soulless long version if you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguely defined psychological horror genre this movie will probably melt your face off maybe not but it will give you a good burn the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutality on video and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has but that s if you don t have much experience with the genre if you ve seen the real thing august underground s penance for example you will as i did find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old i understand this comparison like the video nasties seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasons those that are still popular had something special permit me to be ambiguous i think you will understand those that have stuck around had soul take this quote from gabriele crisanti director of burial ground on an interview on the new ish dvd we will never have more films like these because today technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold so many things will disappear because small films like these won t be produced anymore today we have great exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold today a horror a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars these films were not so expensive they are real effects made with our hands perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously but crisanti has hit the nail on the head even at their most seemingly exploitational the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive truth and this is where boll falls short it s like he s seen the movies and not understood them everything on the checklist is there bs about making a statement about humanity an obscene torture scene etc but it is as crisanti puts it cold the gore is all cgi the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres and the pacing is sooooo slow man so slow another interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game anyway enough bs weak movie

__label__1 while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series upon re watching the series i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated but the plot the gundam design character design and character depth are masterfully executed while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters consequently it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character personally i liked heero because of his stoic personality while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general how can we obtain peace while providing action packed battles in large robot suits which to say the least is excellent 
__label__0 i couldn t watch more than 14 minutes of it it s a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing the shots used are disgusting they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time my head hurts try to watch that load of you know what dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windows annoying what else it s so badly framed all the time it s just make you want to scream at that lady directing there i only directed short films but i m pretty sure i d be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it s gonna be pretty awful so pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost it ll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental and that 1h30 hour of your life you ll never get back 
__label__1 as if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school i read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film and for better or worse and i ve now read and taught the novel for over three decades milo o shea is still leopold bloom 
__label__0 this was another obscure christmas related title a low budget mexican production from exploitation film maker cardona night of the bloody apes 1969 tintorera 1977 which like many a genre effort from this country was acquired for release in the u s by k gordon murray judging by those two efforts already mentioned cardona was no visionary and this one having already received its share of flak over here is certainly no better the film in fact is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color which in view of the prominence of reds apart from st nick himself the devil plays a major role in the proceedings throughout was essential anyway in a nutshell the plot involves satan s efforts to stall santa claus christmas eve rendezvous with the earth s children there is however plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with our portly white bearded and chronically merry man in red lives in a celestial palace who apart from accompanying toy maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing laboriously for the whole first reel in their native tongue visits merlin the famed magician at king arthur s court here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child like hopping and mumbling gibberish once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible by the way the wizard s anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr frankenstein in son of dracula 1974 incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess weight so santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney the devil s antics enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up to hold up st nick s delivery program then is perfectly puerile indeed their tit for tat shenanigans resemble an old laurel hardy routine more than anything to pad out the running time we focus on three sets of children one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company projected as a wish fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra large packages a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own the horned one first tempts her to steal one then invades the little one s dreams to no avail and a trio of brats who egged on once again by satan think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves there is definitely imagination at work here but it is applied with little rhyme or reason while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay 
__label__1 this is a short crudely animated series by david lynch as it says in the beginning and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods overall wearing large man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes and there s no real plot to be seen it s easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd slightly macabre looney tunes with far more gore profanity bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarity i bought the dvd along with eraserhead having previously seen eraserhead don t look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece this is anything but in fact it seems to almost be a statement against such things as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see as lynch says if this is funny it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all 
__label__1 anyone with a young boy in the house who won t watch black white movies should put this on their television set when the child walks by wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting s about tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn t big enough to watch it yet that ll hold him there for a few minutes director george stevens and his team will keep him to the end i think my father did that to me anyway and i m the better man for it this classic adventure yarn set in india during the british occupation features a trio of army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart help arrives in the form of a vicious thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against gunga din was one of the great movies to come out of hollywood s finest year 1939 even more than most great movies from that golden year it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way the theme music is instant hummable nirvana while shot in california the camera work the only thing in gunga din that got so much as an oscar nomination has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the raj of a hundred years before the battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real not staged like some cecil b demille biblical slaughter fest the script doesn t just set up action scenes it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor the main focus is on sgt cutter chasing after tall tales of golden treasures it s a rare actioner for cary grant and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense anchoring the trio is sgt macchesney victor mclaglen who dotes over his elephant annie and tries to protect cutter from his own hare brained schemes he s just as funny in his own way leaving sgt ballantine douglas fairbanks jr displaying some nice errol flynnish dash as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up if gunga din was a lifetime movie it would be about joan fontaine s efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks but since it s a guys film the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save ballantine from a fate worse than death not only marriage but as cutter indignantly exclaims several times the tea business too the political correctness police are hard on this film not so much for the gender issue but the idea of british soldiers saving poor indians from the vicious thuggies it reeks of colonial apologia thankfully this film was made back when and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film that these three sergeants so full of derring do and false racial pride have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval after all for all their swashbuckling glory the film s true sacrifice involves the title character played so heart wrenchingly by sam jaffe back when this film was made movie mogul jack warner had a saying you want to send a message use western union still it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in gunga din i watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what gunga din was really up to when he led cutter to the golden temple was he really plotting revenge against his british overlords would he have been justified in doing so especially given macchesney s cold treatment of him when col weed delivers that eulogy the poem by rudyard kipling on which the film is loosely based was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism s folly of lording it over someone who proved a better man than i am in the end what did they make of the guru s great speech delivered in perfect clipped english you have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith which is your country england well i can die for my country and my faith as readily as you india farewell of course the same character also instructs his brutal followers kill for the love of killing kill for the love of kali kill kill kill which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the british and save the questions about what it all means for later what gunga din means to me most of all is the quickest surest 90 minute thrill ride on video cutter never found his golden temple but there s one for all of us watching gunga din

__label__1 from what critics and audiences indicated birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker still because i love nicole kidman i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure it isn t your basic american comedy and it doesn t take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie but that s why i liked it it was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn t know it was nicole kidman you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k 19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz 
__label__1 insisting that martin luther king s inspirational spirit resides not just in american civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere danish helmer niels arden oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 danish middle school more specifically it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named frits janus dissing rathke against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster svendsen bent mejding adapted from a true story the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving a battle of ideologies between a 13 year old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a dead poets society more than a matilda it treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off frits as a young boy becoming a young man manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money 
__label__0 funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float sure they used various actors for batman but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape in this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for christmas somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original if i had not known it was a sequel i wouldn t have guessed it from the cast except of course charles grodin tries so hard to imitate darrin mcgavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better they should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel this one is just a cheap imitation the ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die 
__label__1 i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out there the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small time thief to lure a more dangerous thief computer hacker out of hiding but alvin sanders the man who the feds have volunteered to be implanted with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good humored but passive or one dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem definetly worth a watch 
__label__0 i watched free money last night it was the longest 90 minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i m a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent it s almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle prod scene there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups why didn t they show charlie sheen s character going back to tow brando s truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasn t buying into it skip this one only for die hard brando fans i m giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo

__label__1 having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff one s hat a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley has quite different qualities in the minis about smiley it is alex guiness as smiley who steals the show the rest of the actors just support him one can say here it is ensemble and story that s important as the lead actor played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes isn t charismatic at all egan just plays a guy called magnus pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech handler never have the machinery behind a spy and or traitor been told better after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into a perfect spy as his czech handler calls him and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once you ve veered off it he trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his mi5 spy masters everyone s happy as long as the flow of faked information continues magnus s father played wonderfully by ray mcanally is a no good con man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad his czech handler alex expertly played by rüdiger weigang creates with the help of magnus a network of non existing informants which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired pym played by egan but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference indeed well worth the money 
__label__0 i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn t need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom however 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand 2 there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r 3 the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long 4 i will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character s mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazi s won the war i don t know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi s won wwii 
__label__0 very silly movie filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously a familiar movie plot being at the wrong place at the wrong time an atrocious subplot involving kim bassinger very robotic and too regimented i have noticed that al pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill a troubleshooter with troubles but nothing more troubling than pacinos horrible atlanta accent damage control needs to fix this damage of a film ok my one liners are bad but not as bad as the ones in this film this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons this movie is unwatchable i did manage to sit through this the plot if written a tad bit better with perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot and even dumber jokes could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums what we are left with is a dull silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that eli wurman was jewish an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere 
__label__1 red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night intense acting great villain and unexpected action some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 min s and 88 of the movie is on a plane and just talking don t worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog a pg 13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller this movies strongest point is its cast this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills if they didn t have those actors the film would have been lost and boring we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later rounding off this cast is brian cox from x men 2 the pacing in this film was great just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you luckily this isn t a long movie and doesn t feel like it either much better then the other flight movie flight plan here is my flight plan comment http www imdb com title tt0408790 usercomments 578i recommend not too long and not too shabby 8 10
__label__0 i loved the curse of frankenstein so much that i rushed out to get frankenstein must be destroyed to see cushing at it again even if it was without chistopher lee this time to my great disappointment this movie not only does without lee but it does without frankenstein s monster altogether was it a case of if we can t get lee we won t have a monster at all why would they do that the monster is half the fun of the whole thing this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum i found the script extremely weak with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much i m willing to suspend a fair amount but this movie got fairly ridiculous which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it peter cushing though is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well the supporting cast is competent but has little to do even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping frankenstein a bumbling police chief is introduced along with his put upon sidekick to generate some comic relief then they are completely dropped from the movie why we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein s brain transplant experiment there was no tension we weren t invested in the creature and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel also there are virtually no horror elements yes there is a beheading in the beginning off camera and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men s skulls off again off camera and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene 90 of which is again off camera i understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show but come on if you re not going to give us a monster then at least let us see the few horrific elements you do choose to include showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary on top of a weak script i thought the directing was mostly flat there were a couple of nice shots but otherwise no excitement atmosphere or suspense was generated the same director did curse back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushing s powerful nuanced performance beyond that i found little in this movie worth recommending instead my suggestion is to watch the curse of frankenstein and see a truly great hammer horror film 
__label__0 the novelty of hearing clean cut jay leno spout four letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched police partners caper in collision course the pelican faced comedian teams up with the late pat morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger think car lover leno played a hand in the plot the two leads try hard they really do but leno is no actor and morita s fish out of water routine gets old in a hurry the film carries a bit of cheesy 80s appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100 minute running time fans of leno s considerable comedic talents will feel let down everyone else will just be bored 
__label__0 this is another typical unbelievable and non sensical piece of hollywood dreck kurt russell as snake pliskin in a business suit convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self and does little to be a convincing victim every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something knocking him down and out kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end of the movie embrace and everybody except russell and stowe knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again he does of course and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm which was entirely unnecessary this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence and the more they can add or enhance the more slobbery they get 
__label__1 thanks jymn magon for creating disney s 2 best cartoons ever this show has improved very much over the years as a kid i didn t like it because i thought it was a rip off of ducktales which was my favorite disney thing at the time like grandmoffromero then later on though it was good but not great but after reading the reviews here i decided to give it another chance bought the dvd set watched the whole pilot the first day i got it was very pleasantly surprised it s still my favorite episode although the series did live up to it and by the end of disc 1 i knew this was going to be a top tenner the characters are so complex charming my favorite has got to be wildcat he s absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot my next favorite is baloo the best pilot on the show i can see why ol jymn built the show around him then it s kit cloudkicker he baloo have the best relationship in the series after that louie jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice after him rebecca she has made me laugh pretty hard and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry and finally for the heroes molly although she s my least favorite i still like her i think she s a very cute character much better than webby from ducktales and the villains were very original don karnage his air pirates always crack me up kahn is ice cold and ruthless and the thembrians are always at least amusing as said before the stories range from hilarious time waits for no bear romance of red chimp to nothing short of touching the old man the seaduck paradise lost to fun funny exciting adventures in search of ancient blunders my favorite for whom the bell klangs these are only a few of my favorite episodes anyway talespin is disney s best aside from gummi bears some reasons for this gb had a decent amount of my favorite character cubbi while ts didn t have enough of wildcat but in the end talespin remains a classic bottom line 10 10 6th best cartoon ever 
__label__1 red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years back he would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue how can we ever forget san fernando red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so his wife georgia died by suicide 
__label__1 this is what i call a great movie it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic but the main theme is very cruel like live is the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country jugoslavia on their way to the capital belgrad the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together watch it and you gonna remember it for life its filled with slavic humor and lifestyle and another reason for its magic it is hard to get 
__label__1 a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i m sure i don t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane austen s most accessible and least stuffy story told well 
__label__0 i m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i m thinking matrix i m thinking bladerunner i m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we ll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact :(
__label__0 assuming this won t end up a straight to video release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless you re bored of good well executed movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with 20 minutes remaining simply because i didn t care anymore about the plot not about insulting the director that is awkward when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie a shot out shattered window before any shots are fired and then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad let s just say this is only an indicator of things to come unfortunately i ll spare you all the details but this is sub par in every manner even the half assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you re expecting half assed acting from him and the rape scene christ shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever 3 10
__label__0 watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes there are a million options to slow down the car in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn t able to stop there aren t many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative cliche s make their appearance the actors are very bad the story is as leak as a sieve etc that makes this movie a waste of time and money 
__label__0 this is your only spoiler warning what a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered oscar worthy i divide material into three levels the first is the stage theatre here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and most importantly in the power of the writer a good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better the best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show the second level is film in this medium a weaker writer can be used but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time with film the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing furthermore film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal the final level is literature in this context everything is imagined by the author translated onto paper and then re imagined by the reader far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio this is why adaptations can go up but never down novelizations are never better than the base film see the dime per dozen ones at your local book store whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book catch 22 and lotr movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies as for the last picture show it fails it is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right the characters talk the same and act the same it s pure futility add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film i saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians the instructor raved about how sad the movie was what is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious had this been in color the scenes of impotence the pool party and the old hooker would be considered great comedy look what lucas did with american graffiti a few years later the american secondary education system needs to start teaching about film rather than trying to teach with film two visually powerful downbeat films apocalypse now and barry lyndon rely on them not this it s the last i want to see of it 1 out of 5 
__label__1 this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris outstanding portrayal of john lennon it doesn t matter that harris doesn t exactly resemble lennon his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure lennon best scene lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney wings silly love songs is worthy of 1 status in america 
__label__1 i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary the musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system the subject is also so fascinating it is about mario andretti and his son michael i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship f1 championship the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500 the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection the other car is michael s new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating paul newman who was michael amoretti s team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film his anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production the main feature is the race scenes turn up the volume here there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget wow the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family this god of the racing world mario andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his son s career they work together so well that every father and son should see this you can tell that they are a close family i wish we could all have that experience 
__label__0 while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now 2002 an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction feats like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer s the odyssey my beef basically is that i couldn t relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didn t find myself saying ack i would have done the same thing it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we re a big happy family let s never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me don t get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical 
__label__1 trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is soon to close we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts to avoid the possibility of avalanches somehow that doesn t make sense anyways he s about to blow away one particularly big one when he notices the resort is open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is over soon as everyone expects an avalanche hits look i m not gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a b movie designed for the family channel which i just saw it on and the fact it had no commercials proves it s a b movie anyways it s a pretty decent film but it s partially unreal firsthand when people are buried by ice and snow they re buried not just traced by powder or what about a cd for a screwdriver it s not possible and finally what i can t stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche guaranteed furthermore it s worth a rental or a tv viewing but not owning 7 10 the movie is rated pg but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the ankle a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel and in the weight room dead people are laying around enjoy 
__label__1 when plague breaks out in new orleans it s richard widmark to the rescue in panic in the streets one of the lesser celebrated films of the great elia kazan kazan keeps the pace brisk and there are lots of marvelous touches the scenes between widmark and barbara bel geddes who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low lifes portrayed by a menacing jack palance his weak yes man zero mostel tommy cook and louis charles there are also some interesting visuals palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn t quite up to the direction and performances it has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily that aside it s well worth viewing kazan was a masterful director 
__label__1 while thinking of the great escape i allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood i had read and re read the autobiographical novel from 1949 which inspired it and when it came to the only cinema we never used that word then actually in town that showed foreign films i was first in line to buy my ticket as someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during wwii i had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men who were there in person that extended later to a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of hans helmut kirst and erich maria remarque which provided an even deeper sensibility the movie versions however were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods the medium of black and white film has never been served so well as it was in those years i have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep chiaroscuros of films like the wooden horse if it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood then i confess it freely and there will never be another the likes of leo genn as the emblematic british war hero on film not even sir alec 
__label__0 i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever i usually like dumb movies if they are somewhat entertaining but i can t even think of one good thing about this movie i like teen witch for heaven s sake but s i c k has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked i would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of twin dragons puppet master vs the demonic toys or even a very brady sequel although this is by far worse then any of those i beg you don t even waste your time believe me its 2 hours you ll never get back 
__label__0 nothing could have saved this movie not even superman ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it plot holes bad lines terrible pacing endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways ugh avoid this one at all costs 
__label__0 beginning with the poster featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey the entire movie was a fraud one stereotype after another this movie was about nothing or nothing new at least after 10 15 minutes you realize that you ve just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop flick basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot shot politician the almighty and above the law organization is called frat and guess what they ve got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects girlfriends you name it frat cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented journalist one hour later after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line you can t beat the system bah don t see this waste of film roll freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether 
__label__0 if this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history mark anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted he died a coward s death by committing suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him the slave chose to kill himself instead in the real story mark anthony was ashamed by the slave s great valor and decided to copy him but even in death mark anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt he cried out for cleopatra and was taken to her bleeding she hauled his litter up on ropes and mark anthony died a while later if you want history don t watch this movie if you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it 
__label__1 while the premise of the film is pretty lame ollie is diagnosed with hornophobia the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick it s also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one probably since this was the last hal roach produced laurel and hardy film in fact it wouldn t be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos something true laurel and hardy films never would do they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack stan and ollie work at a horn factory this sounds pretty funny but it isn t not surprisingly with all the racket ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work the doctor james finlayson in his last film with the team recommends an ocean voyage however they don t like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother once they are on the boat a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea fortunately this portion of the film actually was well paced and the very end worked out very well while not a great full length laurel and hardy film it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers like in the devil s brother or babes in toyland additionally there is still a decent amount of physical comedy something you would see almost none of after this film part of this was due to the boys declining health and ollie s increasing girth and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films 
__label__0  can anybody tell me where is the comedy charlie sheen is a very weak comedian thomas haden church is looking so feeble with him and the whole thing is so thickheaded they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn t even funny like the plan s scene in the bathroom it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more except pain donald sutherland his relationship with his daughter this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all well it would ve been uglier if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real star the sheen s family in here just be aware of that anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or god forbid loving it then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else brando undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isn t and he wasn t intending to be one in here after reading this for sure but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a small time smart or even good sorry i m crying now the movie s torturing is unbelievable there is a scene where brando hitting mira sorvino by her shoes that was so realistic maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap for the milliard time this one could ve been better or less worse the script till the train s heist was nice and i just imagined that they d escape to have some chase like it s another smokey and the bandit but with brando as the sheriff in fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what i ve watched why this masterpiece didn t receive any razzie award you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this i do not think so it s a situation where the razzie s supervisor must himself win one for his negligence martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son and why is that well because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies weren t as good as its ambition it s not a comedy movie no it s a horror one and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones name good thing about it hmmm well this one compared to another marlon brando s monster movie the island of dr moreau 1996 would be close to casablanca p s if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad the ugly and the very ugly in this movie just pray your last prayers and go watch it may god help you 
__label__1 i thought this was a very good movie it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off i m sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending that s why this made this move such a good movie it shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it s 2 sisters dealing with a boy the same boy that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them it s nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone s life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over i really enjoyed watching this movie and i still do now when it comes on i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on it would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died this way it would keep him alive even though he s dead 
__label__0 this adaptation like 1949 s the heiress is based on the henry james novel the heiress starring olivia de havilland remains as a well respected piece of work though less true to james original story than this new remake which retains james original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever and considers her as well as all women simpleminded when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him leigh is a controversial actress most either love her or hate her and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style like she s acting through gritted teeth she s not bad in this and she handles her role relatively deftly it s just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character garners a lot of sympathy she s not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet offering too little story in too long of a movie 
__label__1 this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old i began looking sometime before the rape scene and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking what kinda sick movie is this today i ve seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is it s exciting frightening shocking and in it s own unique way disturbing but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes it ll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river and there is nothing they can do about it it s something they have to live with this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart brilliant and horrifyingand the acting is also great especially jon voight and burt reynolds magnificent acting in this movie all in all john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney s novel a must see for all the movie lovers
__label__1 the book on which this movie is based was excellent it took a while to come to grips with houellebecq s unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author s world of sadness in fact no other book has affected me so much this is not necessarily a good thing it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept houellebecq s insights are masterfully captured by harel and the hero s apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed this is a movie which reveals today s society for the lowly male in all its horror hopefully things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie it s probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again one is enough for any man 
__label__0 i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12a here in the uk to my dismay this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes which is not a problem to me as an adult but not good for watching with children this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes getting hit in the groin etc and for the most part of the film not very funny the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a 2inch midget gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back up until now i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers but this film is certainly taking the biscuit a bit of good advice wait till it comes on tv or cable
__label__0 first off i must stress how rare it is that i take the time to comment on a movie that i have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how i felt about a film that said of the hundreds of movies i have watched i have seen some of the most brilliant shawshank the scariest the woman in black the funniest shark attack iii megaladon and now the worst vampires vs zombies the first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny for those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it s funny look elsewhere it is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what you re getting into that said there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world this is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies this movie suffers from the over used saying i don t know where to start truly everything about this movie is broken from the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as vampires vs zombies some of the following problems are 1 scene misfires it s clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page in one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car you are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is no exaggeration 10 second at least delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen the viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound no movement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or tv commentators dread where was the editing 2 acting a forgivable offense in most cases you can t expect a movie like this to have oscar winners after all but vampires vs zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level these actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools my only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from resident evil on playstation but that acting was even better 3 story wait what story again you can t expect this to be the greatest story ever told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative why the vampires who are the characters who are the bad guys are there good guys why all the lesbians but most importantly what s the deal with the zombies if you have seen this movie then you will understand what i mean but to those who haven t i ll be plain there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it it was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end there s so much more but i hope i ve done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie 
__label__1 my friend and i picked paperhouse out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the horror section neither of us had heard of it but the blurb on the box was really promising and the movie didn t disappoint though i still probably wouldn t call it a horror movie exclusively 11 year old anna madden draws a house and visits it in her dreams she is definitely asleep when she s seeing the house but it s so real in a sense that it s almost like a completely separate reality which in view of later events doesn t seem like a far cry from the truth anyhow she finds she can add to the house its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture while this is going on anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing on top of that she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches though one gets the impression there s actually more to the story than that ok so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough but frankly there s something really menacing about it the dreamworld is eerily surreal the house for instance is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world ongoing dream one of the things anna adds to the house is a boy mark who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about i m not giving that away you know from the moment he appears that it s the same kid in reality mark can t walk due to an illness in anna s drawing world he can t walk because she didn t draw him any legs she blames herself for his real life illness and tries to rectify the situation but everything starts getting really weird she even brings her absent father into the drawing with disastrous results the bits with the father are really terrifying i don t want to give anything away so i ll stop there there seems to be a lot going on in this film i m sure you ll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it is it a simple a story as it seems or are there actually layers of meaning i don t know but either way it s quite fascinating there was a nightmare on elm street ish quality about it in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect i love things like that my only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times but didn t i m satisfied with the ending it had some of you sensitive types might want to have kleenex handy though it really could have a variety of conclusions anyway it doesn t exactly feel drawn out once it s actually over but while you re watching and it keeps fading back in it s a little nerve wracking still paperhouse is a really good film it s well done and acting especially charlotte burke as anna is top notch burke who has never before or since appeared in a film is a real gem i don t know why she never went onto do anything else but either way she s really convincing and enjoyable to watch paperhouse isn t exactly a horror movie it s sort of a fantasy suspense something else type of movie with some definite horroresque moments but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something give it a chance you won t regret it and maybe you should read the book too 
__label__0 the main aspect about the superstar s movies at his later stages were the frequency the lacuna between one movie and the next being a well established star of the south indian cinema the feedbacks he was receiving before baba was great since nattukku oru nallavan 1991 the number of movies he acted in tamil as a mass hero in 11 years were only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year all of these were a great hit he was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down but after padayappa 1999 he went into a state of hibernation his fans all over the world especially in south india were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action so the tamil cinema industry decided to come with baba the movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with superstar in it but this clearly did not work out in this movie as usual the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit rajinikanth s image was totally damaged the fans went nuts the movie s collection did not meet the expected level reputation of great people went down the only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by a r rehman rehman is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like tajmahal kadal virus alli arjuna paarthale paravasam star en swasa katre vandicholai chinnarasu etc well i never thought that this movie would join that league you l feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad it l be because of the superstar s image going down it took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies chandramukhi and sivaji and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film 
__label__1 kalifornia came out in 1993 just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 this is a nice psycho thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work like with most of his episodes of the x files playing god and red shoe diaries people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette lewis characters obviously have never spent much time in the south for every brian and carrie in the south there is an adele and early and in 2006 that s the real horror of this flick aside from that i think the film was written with a cult film intention like with carrie s photography it s not suitable for mass consumption but if you have a copy of this in your personal library i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies 
__label__1 hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare s works branaugh is one heck of an actor his portrayal of this was just amazing his soliloquies were breathtaking for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest however i was engrossed in this particular piece i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much this has everything the modern world looks for in its films murder betrayal and deceit not to knock mel gibson s version but branaughs touches the whole work this leaves no stone unturned when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself um how you say two thumbs up 
__label__0 how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film tina still looked fit and attractive but for some reason seems truly frightened i can understand her fear fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public also i m a fan of the likable adam west again as with tina adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age his acting here is passable but the script is so bad that it s difficult to even listen to the dialog the movie is a rip off of the classic brando biker flick the wild ones out law biker gang is out of control in a small hick town the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn t want them to date my sister the acting is stiff and wooden and the story plot is as old as sand hellriders is hell to watch 
__label__1 obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din the characters that grant mclaglen and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo luke skywalker and chewbacca even sam jaffe s gunga din morphed into c 3po and r2 d2 and like him or not jar jar binks today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today to a young boy this was a great film three strong male leads and only a hint of romance there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight too late to lament lost innocence hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors 
__label__1 in 2006 the ampas awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on earth that film was march of the penguins narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman walt disney studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now they ve taken their stabs at live action film making and it s been hit and miss all across the board disney then created a sub division called disneynature and release its first feature film titled earth this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i ve seen in quite sometime narrated by the great james earl jones earth doesn t offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter it enables an emotional connection to nature that i haven t experienced before it also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails it s one thing to watch mufasa fall from a cliff in to a stampede or bambi s mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods it s all good because at the end of the film we know it is just that a film this shows penguins polar bears elephants all types of families from all walks of life living and dying in their natural habitats these real things make a real movie experience though a bit heavy weight on the graphic nature of the film which many people will disagree earth is a touching experience there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george fenton in comparison to march of the penguins or grizzly man it doesn t really hold any measure but it stands great on its own at the end of the day you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we ll witness in the film we live here yet it s like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another earth is beautiful 
__label__0 i absolutely love all of tom robbins books so i was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books i knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of robbins magic but after seeing the movie it made me never want to read the book again the movie even cowgirls get the blues doesn t include an eighth of the content in the book and it seems to focus more on the love connection between bonanza jellybean and sissy than anything else along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie i think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters the only actors in the movie that i thought played their roles fit to robbins descriptions in the book were julian s friends in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie those who haven t read the book might enjoy the movie but as a huge tom robbins fan this movie was nothing but a disappointment 
__label__1 when i first saw this film in the 1980 s i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the sesame street muppets age i honestly don t remember if i liked it at the time or not however somewhere in college i watched this film again and it wound up going and staying into my personal best films ever collection this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets i mean obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there s humor geared towards both generations but come on janice is accidentally overheard telling someone i don t take my clothes off for anyone even if it is artistic there s a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn t want to hear it gonzo saves a chicken with mouth to mouth resuscitation sp and afterwards says i think we re engaged now these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling add to that very smart dialogue very smart new york broadway wink wink humor the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don t border on kid level cheesy whatsoever this film is a masterpiece i don t throw 10 s out on a regular basis but this one deserves it over 20 years later this film totally holds up perhaps even more so the muppets never were and never will be again as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is q
__label__1 i read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie is diamond among coals during this era liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw this film should have made them stars shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film it could have easily been a franchise release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it you won t be disappointed do yourself another favor read the book same title it ll blow you away times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have 
__label__1 this movie is great if you enjoy watching b class movies that is this is a classic college 80 s slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kinda funny if you ask me

__label__0  don t read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of the crater lake monster to be a total surprise a claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of crater lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks not to mention your fast forward button to call the crater lake monster amateurish is to overstate the obvious if you aren t a fan of low budget drive in films you probably wouldn t be looking here in the first place the problem with the movie is that when there s no monster action going on it really sucks and goes nowhere the script is very ed wood ish in that it s utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences nothing is too outlandish for the crater lake monster it explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into crater lake superheating the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable wouldn t superheating the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate other than some token fog in one or two scenes we see no evidence of the water being hot other than a few lines in the script the script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino a couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced they decide to rent a boat and head out into crater lake hmmmm do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity in a sequence that s just plain bizarre a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze a car chase ensues and wouldn t ya know it they end up right by the lake snack time for cratey yeah it s not hard to figure out and you re so far ahead of the script that you re irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold the shamelessness of it all is endearing and i really want to like the crater lake monster i just can t do it there s not enough here to go on and this is more of a movie to put on during a party because you could talk right over it and it wouldn t matter the film has a slim list of the things going for it the most important being the dinosaur itself which appears in three forms a shadow puppet a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good there are also a pair of lovable hicks in it and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie a downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it why was i so affected by this conclusion was it the mournful song played over the closing credits or was i just weeping inwardly for the time that i waste watching films like this 
__label__1  and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know 5 3 the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace true i give it a 10 in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it s true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine it isn t 
__label__0 i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie bachelor party starring tom hanks is this movie even an official sequel this movie is lacking in every department and you re obviously better off not watching it for a comedy this movie simply isn t good or funny enough it relies mostly on the character s their stereotypical assessments rather then the movie actually features some good original and funny moments of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages you just keep waiting for things to finally start off there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it s something non existent i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out it s basically a typical teenage comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity only without the teenage main characters which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless the movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any type of movie i regret ever watching this 3 10
__label__0  the dream child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage the only good films in the series were wes craven s 1984 original and the third part the dream warriors of 1987 the second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor clawed maniac turned jokester yelling stupid one liners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a super dumb eerie children s rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel in short no originality just a decline of the old formula and an over load of painfully annoying jokes my generous rating of 3 10 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel freddy s dead which is awful beyond belief in case you re not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast the dream child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint 
__label__0 a patient escapes from a mental hospital killing one of his keepers and then a university professor after he makes his way to the local college next semester the late prof s replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings the dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the 80 s despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible splatter university is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape that would be more entertaining skip it and rent girl s nite out instead rated r for strong graphic violence profanity brief nudity and sexual situations 
__label__0 now it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title so i ll wait on that first this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles then i realized it this is a movie with a message that message is beat kids and things like this won t happen things like what you ask things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical kill the monster indirectly fashion now as promised blue monkey has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind now it snot like i was cheated or anything the picture on the cover had a giant bug crab idiot thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses that kinda happened but i wanted apes having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before half drunk on cask and creame s brandy mind you i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80 s style not so much if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids rent this 
__label__1 some people loved the aristocrats and others hated it frequently walking out in the middle reactions to eddie izzard aren t likely to be that extreme if you can handle a transvestite comedian who says he likes girls and has a vocabulary that makes shall we say enough use of the f word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television many of izzard s fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances on the other hand i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard s chest but also more often than not funny and in spots absolutely hilarious he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines he s not a story teller he s not a joke maker he s not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams he plays around with ideas some of which work and some of which a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz for instance are completely unfunny he has a way however of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8 but a 10 no way 
__label__0 i haven t seen this movie in a while so i m afraid i can t be very specific about details it did have some interesting points ralph bakshi s attempt at an animated adaptation of j r r tolkien s masterpiece was a very ambitious project so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production therefore not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made the film itself seems less than finished it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed but whether or not it s intentional is hard to say the whole thing seems shabbily made and undone especially the orcs and the nazgul another problem of course is the huge gaps in the plot bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time far too many important bits were left out and i don t refer only to tom bombadil which i think was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie and of course the ending which is completely sudden and out of place i m not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there or if he even had any idea where he s going to end it the characters well most of them were okay the hobbits don t look so bad except for the gay sam did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character if you re a tolkien fanatic like me watch this movie though i m not too sure about buying it what special features does the dvd version have anyway but know in advance that you re not going to watch a real lord of the rings movie but not much more than a historical curiosity which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool the idea was to cast george as gandalf paul as frodo ringo as sam and john as gollum if you didn t read the book or didn t like it much or don t like animation films or don t want to see a half finished movie stay away 
__label__1 the movie was very sweet and heartwarming i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so inspiring to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie the little girl who raised paulie love overcame all the obstacles 
__label__1 any movie that shows federal pigs persons in government to be the power mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me alas the script supervision and editing and even at times the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it despised it loathed it thought it was a terrible irrational piece of junk now though i don t remember why i believe the two should not be compared or even connected consider them as two different movies rate them as two different movies this vanishing point provides a rallying place a banner for people who want to encourage individualism who believe in human rights who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is especially the federal government the voice wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire live free or die at one time it would have been the motto of most americans despite its obvious flaws vanishing point is a film to cheer 
__label__0 you might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made for from the beginning since the credits list susan dey as special guest star um why would a one off mow like this have a guest star well if you stick with it you ll find yourself paying attention to little else but ms dey s butt wiggling in a flowered bikini as the partridge family house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes susan s derrière is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene sadly susie and her tush fight a losing battle the jiggle tv craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role in 1976 fat freddy silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as susan s audition tape for charlie s angels as is our susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber neurotic women the view beyond susan s heinie it must be said is not very compelling the scenery is nice and photographed in a bizarre hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera nope it s just a typically suspense challenged 70 s made for tv thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash and collect some cable residuals though they obviously didn t know that at the time and show off their range here we re treated to a tv scale nuclear family squaring off against tv scale thugs who can t decide whether they re a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television don t mess with dennis weaver see mccloud and duel the only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage son character of steve played by the long forgotten if ever remembered kristoffer tabori who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is supposedly menacing his family but steve as played by tabori gosh why didn t we see more from this wunderkind is actually just grumpy and moody and isn t one bit conflicted when big d gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial and literal sand for the sleep deprived and susan deyniacs there must be some of you out there only 
__label__1 murder in mesopotamia i have always considered one of the better poirot books as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending there is no doubt that the tv adaptation is visually striking with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score as always david suchet is impeccable as hercule poirot the comedic highlight of the episode being poirot s battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night and hugh fraser is good as the rather naive captain hastings the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances but are careful not to overshadow the two leads a danger in some christie adaptations some of the episode was quite creepy a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as five little pigs an episode that i enjoyed a lot more than this one what made it creepy in particular putting aside the music was when louise leidner sees the ghostly face through the window about the adaptation it was fairly faithful to the book but i will say that there were three things i didn t like the main problem was the pacing it is rather slow and there are some scenes where very little happens i didn t like the fact also that they made joseph mercado a murderer in the book i see him as a rather nervous character but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer and under developing that made him a less appealing character though i am glad they didn t miss his drug addiction i also noticed that the writers left out the fact that mrs mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer s next victim the other thing that wasn t so impressive was that i felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy leatheran like it was in the book amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation on the whole despite some misjudgements on the writers behalf i liked murder in mesopotamia 7 10 bethany cox 
__label__1 are we really making video nasties again in the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8mm this is quite a ride unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of paris hamburg and amsterdam i am however being rather churlish for the depraved scenes including everything from hot wax harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning beheading and some these scenes are immaculate and it s a pity bruno and his budget couldn t stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures 
__label__0 as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars 
__label__0 this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise s marriage hopefully that effort produces better results 
__label__1 as an amateur historian of ww2 nazi germany i couldn t wait for this to come out on dvd i missed it when it was first on in 2003 i don t want to repeat what s already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies a better job could ve been done portraying the charming hitler i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices not so much for their acting but for their appearances peter stormare doesn t look much like rohm why didn t they make babson as hess wear a wig and my biggest complaint so much has always been made of hitler s striking blue eyes why didn t they make carlyle wear blue contacts on the plus side i thought the actors who played goring and drexler looked pretty good again as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st history 2nd i don t think a lot of harm will be done 
__label__1 years ago i found a bargain bin copy of this film for a buck or two in so many ways this is quite fitting as when it was made back in 1933 it was truly a cheaply made film by the poverty row studio majestic however while the film is rather derivative it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises the story is very very familiar as in some germanic town the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires adding to this familiarity is dwight frye he played renfield in dracula and here he is very very similar though he plays a much more harmless weirdo in this case he s obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths the film does a good job of providing some red herrings i e false leads and while it doesn t take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film in addition while the production had little money to speak of it still had some good actors of the day lionel atwill and melvin douglas and it also used universal studios sets at night when they were done filming for the day as a result the film looks pretty good overall though i also thought that as usual fay wray was terrible thought it didn t noticeably detract from the film i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth she always seems to be cast as the screaming lady and provides little new in each film overall for fans of old horror films this is excellent and worth seeing for people who are not fans of the genre it s probably pretty skip able 
__label__0  and that s why hard to rate from the adult point of view hmm student point of view i must say i fell nearly asleep here sure there is some laughing scene all the credit takes here eddie but that can t save the disney type of script and whole movie that s why2 out of 10:)
__label__0 if there was a scale below 1 it would get a 10 following in the footsteps of godspell the acting if there was such a thing was atrocious the plot in shambles and rene russo was sickeningly sweet in her role enough to make a person retch ten thumbs down for a dumb movie saving grace kudos for era costuming 
__label__1 to all the haters out there condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages that being said i was a huge fan of bsg thought it was some of the best tv drama not just sci fi on the air but it was time for it to end and the story to move on i liked the bsg epilogue the plan but it raised as many new questions as it answered so i eagerly anticipated caprica and i was not disappointed i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg and i was pleased that caprica is something different and i personally found the story exciting in a different way than blazing space battles explosions and sci fi special effects don t get me wrong i like that stuff too eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances and alessandra was just wonderful i can t wait until next week 
__label__1 in many ways dirty work is a predictable l h short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone s chimney guess what happens next that s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues but there s one or two things that seem untypical ollie for example is very unlikable he s arrogant he s rude and not only to stan look at the way he addresses the servant with hey you and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being i have nothing to say in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he s always at his funniestdirty work also lacks the reportary regulars of the other l h shorts like finlayson long busch and housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan also watch out for a scene featuring a fish many jokes plots from l h feature fish and this is another one
__label__1 at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15 000 votes it has a 5 8 rating something is wrong with that picture personally i give it a 10 i can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is it is a movie based on a comic book hero this movie won more than it s share of awards won 3 oscars another 5 wins 26 nominations right there tells me it s better than a 5 8 some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come if you re looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times al pacino is great as big boy caprice 
__label__0 in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems where the geneva convention human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate however if you want to see a film about that try ed zwick s flawed the siege instead because nada is one of the most infantile political thrillers ever made like robert altman s pret a porter the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine s spy vs spy strip michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell mariangela melato a cardboard middle class revolutionary wannabe who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught the corrupt authorities fare a little better but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people cf election but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they re intellectuals who are talking down to the masses in truth were one to recast testi duchaussoy and melato with jim varney johnny knoxville and shannon tweed the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film not lower it chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously but his staging is so inept the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch special mention must be made here of duchaussoy so very good in chabrol s que la bete muere he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it s back again chabrol has made some fine films but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this which would be a great shame utter drivel and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material one star out of ten and that s being very generous 
__label__0 what do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don t care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget why you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made i m referring of course to domino here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie ooh wow the storyline is told out of sequence that hasn t been done a billion times before and much more skillfully than in this movie wow look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions the director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style it s just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they re in and it s also too bad that most of them come across as irritating i ve heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before i ve seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before this one too uh didn t they reveal this plot twist about half an hour ago was that supposed to be surprising if this movie is supposed to be showing a tough chick going around kicking ass when why doesn t she do very much of it i can t believe how unoriginal this dialogue is how long is this thing i feel like i ve been watching it for over four hours already i have no idea what just happened but also i don t particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out is this over yet i want my money back the songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here it s ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one ugh and finally i might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me in summation this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect avoid watching it at all costs if your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn t flammable you should seriously consider being burned alive instead if i sound bitter it s because i just spent over two hours watching this movie and uh i didn t enjoy it very much 
__label__0 when i was a kid we always used to be babysat and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema this is one of the films we watched this is one of the stupidest films i ve ever seen i think it might even be a walt disney pictures film a martian is dropped on earth turns into a human befriends a human and is trying everything he can to get back home but he is distracted by the wonders of the earth the only good comment i can give is the choice of actors back to the future s christopher lloyd as the martian uncle martin dumb and dumber s jeff daniels as tim o hara elizabeth hurley as brace channing and daryl hannah as lizzie but apart from that it s complete crap poor 
__label__0 the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course it s not going to be an oscar nominated film it s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert it s just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience i d give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if you re bored and nothing else 4 10
__label__1 wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really it s a stretch to call this a kid s film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel esquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid hero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike s work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti war anti revenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi faceted adventure f n rad and one of miike s best 
__label__1 eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand up concert film i have ever seen most stand up acts usually have lulls at some point but not this one folks for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side splittingly funny from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead on impression of mr t the laughs are non stop sadly this was done in 1983 and eddie hasn t done anything nearly as funny it s unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all eddie if you re out there please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious believe me your fans will love you for it and i think you know that 
__label__0 it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasn t a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i can t say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a 10 year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman 4 
__label__1 i read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later i saw the movie there are a few differences 1 billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days not 10 worms in one day by 7 00pm 2 billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he s eaten all the worms in the movie after billy eats all the worms joe has to go to school with worms in his pants 3 joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie he doesn t at all even though there are changes this movie is still one that kids will enjoy 
__label__1 this is not my favorite wip women in prison but it is one of the most famous films in the sub genre it is was produced by roger corman who at this point had already produced a few wips it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula the movie takes place in an usa prison not in a banana republic like most wip films i m not sure if that was a wise move but it is an acceptable change of pace writer director demme really gets into his job always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario in fact he is a little too ambitious for his own good the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks in chains flick but do not worry demme still operates within the parameters of the sub genre there is plenty of nudity and violence something that will satisfy hardcore fans the film is a little slow but it is very entertaining the cast is good roberta collins is a wip veteran so she does not need an introduction and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair bound crazy warden pam grier is sorely missed though 
__label__1 i don t know how and where do the iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this in fact it s a very simple plot that many directors could come up with but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way jafar panahi did the film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time one connected to the other the football match and the battle between sexes that s going on behind the walls of the stadium it makes you feel like you are in the movie and you re one of the characters and while watching the movie as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match you will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie it s gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending you will want to find out the verdict you ll be dying to see what will happen to the girls i like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee it s like venus vs mars it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like iran this is the second movie of jafar panahi that i have seen the first being crimson gold and am looking forward to watching some more am already hooked with iranian movies and this one is a must see 
__label__1 i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean thor heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient incas in peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to polynesia based on certain relics that are found in both places certain types of ancient sea going vessels that we know they had available analysis of ocean and wind currents and the knowledge that the incas did in fact travel in some undetermined amount at sea in order to test his hypothesis heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient incas had available using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time and set out from lima peru s capital to try to reach the islands of polynesia some 5 000 miles away his theory like so much about ancient history is impossible to prove with 100 certainty but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100 day expedition but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released 
__label__1 most 70s and 80s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes like porno films really but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a style it s really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect works second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today s measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who unfolds the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn t know who he s seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedy noir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre the five venoms idea is the template for tarantino s deadly viper assassins from the kill bill volumes 
__label__0 this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother another f13th take off the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80 s slashers 
__label__1 although cinderella isn t the obvious choice for a sequel i love jaq and gus so i didn t hesitate the format of the mice writing a book for cinderella was an inspired one i enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this the three stories are cute amusing although the songs were forgettable jaq and gus were my favourite characters but i also enjoyed seeing lucifer bruno the mice chorus and all the rest pom pom proved the perfect companion for lucifer and i liked the governess a sequel done right for a change my rating 8 10 
__label__0 i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn t think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasn t the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era if this isn t the least funny set of sketch comedy i ve ever seen it ll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel ridden this waste of 75 minutes is seminal comedy only in the world where seminal really does mean semen scatological humour only in a world where scat is actually feces precursor jokes only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy tits and bums and the odd beaver nice if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven t found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early 70s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint retro hardly sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score and i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief 
__label__0 i ll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie guess i didn t approach it with the proper dewy eyed nostalgia of the generation before me but suffice it to say st elmo s fire was pretty crap freaking tastic even as far as brat pack films go here is yet another lovely example of the smug self indulgent neurosis that is everything 80s rent anyone the plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best poorly delivered the rest of the time the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn t help the situation there really was no growth no forward movement at all even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest most predictable way possible the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass the gorgeous slut hides really soulful deep pain with a wild lifestyle the poet moods and mopes around for a full 3 4 of the film until he can reveal he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows the virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every virgin s desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change for real this time the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters commitment which brings me to my final beef what bond of super cement was holding these people together as friends i can t imagine being with just one of them now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar and they were all so terrible to each other heads in toilets near rape and sleeping around with everrrryone the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist she s like umm actually i don t want to be with either of you anymore let s be friends and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment not that word and they all smile as if to say golly gee i never thought of that what a great idea only it s not kinda in the way that watching this movie is not 
__label__0 this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can t believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can t tell me this wasn t the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don t watch this junk 
__label__0 the more i think about it there was nothing redeeming about thismovie i saw it 9 months ago so my memory might have made itworse than it was but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of10 after seeing the movie i met the director he seemed so cluelessas to what he was doing or what he had done and as far as icould tell he didn t care for the film either even he agreed that hedidn t really know what he was doing and he was forced to docertain things because it was filmed digitally i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that itbuilt for itself 9 people all have to be connected in some way howcan we get from point a to point b so in order get from theprostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10minutes on each character s relationship to another person itmakes one feel choked by the 2 demensional badly drawncharacters i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie stevebouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing that s it as isay 4 out of 10 
__label__1  the shop around the corner 1940 is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation by 1940 director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm and his famed lubitsch touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark this film was planned for a 1939 release but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming rather than substituting either of his main stars lubitsch decided to postpone production in the meantime directing greta garbo in ninotchka 1939 when it was finally completed the shop around the corner appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role time nevertheless has betrayed the film s massive and enduring influence with high profile remakes including in the good old summertime 1949 and you ve got mail 1998 at its surface one might assume the shop around the corner to simply be the story of two lovers klara novak sullavan and alfred kralik stewart who love each other without knowing it however lubitsch s film runs much deeper than that it s the story of matuschek and company a stylish gift shop in budapest and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family when store owner hugo matuschek frank morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work there s absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states perhaps in the blustery streets of new york but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film in fact even as i write this review i m beginning to appreciate the story even more sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but i think that it s the supporting cast that really make the film each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek who in any other film would have been restricted to an underdeveloped two dimensional portrayal matuschek may have lost the love of his family but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy charles smith this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder s later creations for example boom boom jackson in the fortune cookie 1966 or carlo carlucci in avanti 1972 of course it doesn t really need saying but billy wilder learned from the best 
__label__0 i rented this because i m a bit weary of 80s nbc programming and apparently i saved myself a lot of money i have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premise we have a character who is unlikable he s full of flaws not enlightened and a complete jerk on a good day yet the reason why anybody should care just isn t there while creating an american sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential it just isn t met here within this show most of the supporting characters aren t fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags as in any sitcom they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there because why there is no reason any normal people would have simply left the abuse keeping them there without any real reason even the really unbelievable one given by joanna cassidy in the very special 2 part abortion episode that has major problems of its own is where the show just falls apart to simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation if anything this isn t even dramedy this is a badly plotted conceived and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea but the execution is so haphazard that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the jerry springer show where someone is abused by this tyrant that we re supposed to root for because we are told to a show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily but somehow aren t able to and that s a fatal error that really killed the program chalk it up to a show in its infancy regardless the show is worth a watch but it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been

__label__1 the absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty dane douglas sirk born detlef sierck written on the wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame from its justly famous opening sequence with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later little screen knockoffs as dallas dynasty and falcon crest over their years long runs the combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme americans in our dollar based society find irresistible brother and sister robert stack and dorothy malone are the spoiled troubled heirs to the hadly oil fortune boyhood chum rock hudson and new bride lauren bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron it s been rumored that the story was based on libby holmann s marriage into reynolds tobacco money as always the misfits get all the scenery to chew and the best lines to spit out malone in her oscar nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for hudson gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them hudson while good can t compete with all this over the top emoting bacall starts out strong but grows recessive a mere plot convenience no matter with a succession of set pieces shot in extravagant hues sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late 50s america nobody ever did it better 
__label__0 let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well loved and well respected not to say revered author in order to draw attention to their home movies out on dvd hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers in fact lied about only to be revealed finally as ludicrously inept in every department the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer producer director since it appeared on dvd many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students since this film does not even use the basic grammar of scripting editing continuity direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time it is possible the director did show up for the shoot certainly there was no one present who knew even remotely what they were doing an ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their 9 00 outlay much was promised absolutely nothing was delivered except monty python meets war of the worlds with all the humour taken out indefensible trash just unbelievable there are real independent film makers out there to be checked out people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be people could do worse than keep an eye on brit film maker jake west s evil aliens for example 
__label__1 i had never heard of this film until i came across it by accident when browsing imdb i saw it had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful expletives on how much it stunk of course this meant i had to see it i was pleasantly surprised as whipped is actually rather a good movie i watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed hollywood fluff comedies this is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter sex and dating without the usual hollywood fakery i distinctly suspect that people s opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life if you ve never dated or partied much you won t get this movie because you won t have met people like these characters if you have you ll recognize many of the situations that portrayed here in comedic fashion the ending was also good as it did not portray women as unreal helpless virginal romantics in contrast to many hollywood movies 
__label__0 you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a disaster the question is not how did it get made because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film they will do so no the question is why oh why did steve martin allow it to be made i think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything he knew the sequel was going to be so frightful that out of pride he wouldn t even count it s royalties as income the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nation s favorite poor black family and dcreasy2001 aka mark blankfield it s just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel s lone cheerleader as an imdb user comment i was praying for you to veer over into satire but alas you were really making an effort at spin why not 10 stars

__label__1 a very strong movie bruce is good and brad also as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job well novikov property seems to me work in this movie however i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds multiplicity so bruce could save the world but not his world in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself and i do believe there is no problem in that here i disagree with dr brown from back but the story pf 12 monkeys has its own beauty inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor his girlfriend was just lost a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future the bullet well it might be some mistake some falsification well i like this movie has to buy a dvd best 
__label__0 the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hit man who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
__label__0 the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn t work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow julie gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in her however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that s basically it watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest trust me you aren t missing much 
__label__1 i won t give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion the film is expertly paced and the acting especially by talia sharon as ya ara the blind woman is excellent israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the u s 
__label__0 it s common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone there s a difference however between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members in the secret lives of dentists starring campbell scott and hope davis director alan rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life scott gives a fine performance in the role of david hurst a dentist married to another dentist davis rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly he is completely absorbed in the day to day duties of being the parenthood she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life and then ratchets up the tension when scott may or may not witness his wife with another man from this point on the film focuses on whether or not david is going to confront his wife dana about her possible adultery or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good from time to time david is treated to visits from an imaginary friend in the form of a former patient played by denis leary borrowing heavily from brad pitt s tyler durden in fight club while there is enough uncertainty about dana s infidelity and david s instability to warrant examination the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative instead rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the hurst family culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film s climax the film never picks up on the hints at what david is really capable of if he wasn t so dedicated to his family neither does it spend much time looking at dana s precarious balancing act between her family life and her other more fulfilling ambitions by choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry rudolph kills the momentum of his film by the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly the film has used up all the good graces of scott s well measured performance david and dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale with nothing to build on over the last hour the conclusion seems awkward and patched on the secret lives of dentists takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it altogether a disappointing unimaginative film 
__label__1 my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore i think the title especially put me off i can t ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did i was completely caught up in ruby s situation as she tries to make her way through her life the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly i could have kept watching for hours another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since she is so perfect in this movie this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time 
__label__1 this is a great film i first saw this film when it came out i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it a lot of films we watched when we were younger don t seem to hold up when we watch them later in life the film is actually a great 80 s example of the type of films made then keaton is at his best all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80 s is too funny being from the 80 s i loved seeing the ugly pacer again the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80 s film lovers 
__label__0 the dudes at mst3k should see this dog of a film it s basically about a dopey hack actor in hollywood who can t land any acting gigs and he has this strange obsession with the movie taxi driver so what does this dumb actor do he dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a l a surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles you ll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie s inadvertently funny scenes like when the actor dude s girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like how could you do this to me and why is she crying cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs this movie makes no sense at all the actor who played the governor on benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog this movie will crack you up trust me you talking to me 
__label__0 with the runaway success of god s army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasn t at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the singles ward however is not telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the singles ward is in many ways very similar to the 80s comedy ferris bueller s day off however the similarities end there while ferris bueller was funny original and well acted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the singles ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you ve probably heard a million times before the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is amaturish at best in addition if you re not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you won t get hardly anything at all whereas god s army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it it s just not that funny 
__label__1 this chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture i don t belong and are far from in an almost buddhist approach the film helps one to relate to each character and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things all actors are brilliant and xu hzu exudes kindness and wisdom yet also vulnerable and mean er min the retarded brother shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate persons in this universe a different china this is far from the chinese realism yet it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kind get it you won t be disappointed 
__label__1 based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village in the diamond mining town of tijuco in brazil the diamond commender appointed by the king of portugal is the ultimate authority having grown up in the relative security of his house the young and beautiful xica da silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter in a desperate bid to save herself xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king intending to use them to escape the king s army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day however and when the loot turns up missing the diamond commender is led away in chains his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs martin the diamond commender s son swears vengeance xica and the other slaves however are sold at auction and xica ends up in the home of the sergeant major an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust to the town of tijuco however comes the new diamond commender the elegant and ruthless joao fernandes immediately struck by xica s beauty he manipulates the sergeant major into selling her to him and thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen the series is filled with rich details of the era s beliefs superstitions politics fashion etc etc and it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists xica da silva is definitely a must i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd 
__label__0 please note i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing my review must be read with this in mind although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well this is in many ways a technically poorly made film while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 up through the early to almost the mid 30s a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film the lip movements in many and in particular this film don t even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms brooks could do a french film this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film and as a silent film this is would have been an average film with excellent camera work at times and some decent silent style acting the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot for a silent morality play circa 1920 it would have been fine but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary that means old not slutty a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can t handle it she gives it all up temporarily but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end a tad melodramatic huh and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped finally the character of the fiancé s friend i found very disturbing and unreal he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean spirited were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused this seems to me that s what is implied and i don t like it at all there are far better french films of the era le million la femme du boulanger fanny regain and others as well as better silent films i just can t understand this film s high rating 
__label__1 being an otaku since the days of robotech i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time considering when it was made the animation is of superior quality there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality although the final episode is in black and white it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film although it has been described as being sappy it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do since the main character is a female it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to macho man tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers the seiryuu for noriko incidentally also plays akane in ranma 1 2 noriko is as 3 dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious homing laser and buster shield which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style technique i doubt that scene was meant to be funny but it cracked me up yet all in all i would rank gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time 
__label__0 i m not to keen on the pallbearer it s not too bad but just very slow at the times as the movie goes on it gets a little more interesting but nothing brilliant i really like david schwimmer and i think he s good here i m not a massive gwyneth paltrow fan but i don t mind her sometimes and she s okay here the pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it 
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that s never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien s roommates bandmates they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you re one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans don t bother with this one 
__label__1 this movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen but it s got quite a bit of quality it s pretty lifelike yet you think it s only a movie duvall and close portray common people and you d never even realize they are now big name actors it seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing eugene s girlfriend but i guess it s possible it seems unlikely that the kid would travel from montana to nevada by himself but i guess it s possible you might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family but i guess it s possible i remember glenn close saying something like you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life but it isn t 
__label__1 if i could go back even as an adult and relive the days of my summer s spent at camp i would be there so fast the camps i went to weren t even this great they were in texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing the movie cinematography was astounding the characters funny and believable especially perkins pollack and arkin sam raimi s character and sub antics were priceless so who ever thought this movie was lame i have deep pity for because they can t suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity i wish i could it was funny intelligent beautifully scripted brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even sorta like dances with wolves and ladyhawk good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors rent it see it buy it and watch it over and over and over never gets old 0 
__label__1 i bought this movie a few days ago and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film but when i popped it into the dvd player it surprised me in a very good way james belushi plays very well as bill the mouth manuccie but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff the end scene in the house of bill is very excellent good camera work nice dialogues and very good acting bill the mouth manuccie has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia together with his wife he lives in south carolina in a witness protection program but the mafia tracks him down and wants the 12 million dollar bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out himself 
__label__0 this mess is so bad it doesn t even qualify as horror debbie rochon s talent is completely wasted in this film she is not even the villain the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won t even mention it do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform better than sex it s total 80 s disco candy song nice up tempo song about gambleing sex way more entertaining than bleed put it this way when one has the equipment to copy videos but decides only to record the song at the end of movie you have a really bad movie 
__label__0 whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for you do not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on it doesn t 
__label__1 every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies i ll mention titanic and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and they re too embarrassed now to admit it i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people won t even admit they enjoyed it folks let s get something straight you don t look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynic no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixed this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears the music which has also been a victim of the film s success was a key ingredient james horner s score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dion s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many i confess i am a titanic buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i ve had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanity another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed 
__label__1 i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york it was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as horror hotel i just bought this movie on dvd and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and or italian and no subtitles are provided then the other actors respond in english to what was being said kind of weird also on the dvd box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb aside from that this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth barbara steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists that scene existed in the tv version but it was very edited i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra edition it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions where are the master tapes and all the unused footage aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle the rest of the movie is pretty good there aren t too many special effects but herbert s face after julia clubs him is a good one the creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero she makes the movie a ten 
__label__0 i can t believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and i feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs when one of the main characters announces that he s gay twice in the first five minutes don t ignore it as typical pc nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won t if his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn t make you sick then be thankful the freak who wrote and or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint i mean get real it s one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick s supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of closure over the sudden death of her daughter what does one thing have to do with the other one might be tempted to ask apparently the two issues are inextricably interwoven and if that weren t bad enough there s the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor i mean seriously hasn t that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis why must she go around like that at the very least how about shaving the ugly thing off and while you re at it have those horrible moles removed too would you slurp up some ice cream she just served you i think not it must be a new jersey thing you d think diane keaton might save this piece of drek but think again was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse i don t even wanna think about it so what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter this grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that s all there is to it one wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going none of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant trust me pass this piece of crap up it s not about death a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it it s a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director 
__label__0 he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero s acting and the hole thing was i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie 
__label__0  when will i ever learn the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane please allow me to vent my spleen i will admit the setting presumably new york city has never been so downright ugly and unappealing i am reminded that the 70 s was a bad decade for men s fashion and automobiles and all the smoking if the plan was to cheapen the characters it succeeded for a film to work at least in my simple estimation there has to be at least one sympathetic character only ned beaty came close and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky if a stray shot had struck mikey well it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most i can t remember when i detested a film as strongly i suppose i m a rube who doesn t dig art flicks oh well 
__label__0  kings and queen is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty two minutes to no discernible point or purpose the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named ismael a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora s and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining kings and queen might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really don t know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance nora s father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter s character that simply doesn t gibe with the woman we ve been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother theresa then again who is but she certainly doesn t deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit self absorbed at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i don t think so perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and co writer director arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning 
__label__1 i d heard of eddie izzard but had never seen him in action i knew he was a transvestite and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer i put it on not knowing how my husband would react well he blew us away he s better than robin williams ever was he has total control of the audience when he does the englebert is dead no he s not routine the audience doesn t know what to think by the end god as james mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england cake or death is priceless my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on if you get the chance to see this show cancel everything and tape it you won t be disappointed 
__label__0 if this movie should be renamed it should be the jackasses of hazzard to sum it up this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 dodge charger around town and in the country chasing the girls and eluding the law i have been a fan of the dukes and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key the overindulgence of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the dukes into trailer trash side from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible the only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 dodge charger named general lee the others have exaggerated the character s role which tarnished the movie the dukes have been another casualty of the 21 st century hollywood television to big screen transition tragedy skip this movie and just buy the television series on dvd my grade f
__label__1 this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today 
__label__0 i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu whose masterfully understated views of japanese life especially in the post wwii era illuminate universal truths having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949 s late spring and 1953 s tokyo story i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery it is taiwanese director hou hsiao hsien s keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film among with co screenwriter t ien wen chu hsiao hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable the story concerns yôko a young japanese writer researching the life of mid 20th century taiwanese composer jiang wen ye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese after 25 drawn out minutes of character set up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan at the same time yôko s coffeehouse friend hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her hsiao hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains while these techniques are consistent with ozu s style hsiao hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular yôko s plight seems rather non committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents reaction overly passive to hold much interest in fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable j pop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yôko while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime the rest of the characters barely register even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yôko s parents cinematographer lee ping bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots hitoto speak sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits hito shian the dvd includes an hour long french made documentary métro lumière which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiao hsien s approach to the film it includes excerpts from ozu s films in particular equinox flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either tokyo story or early summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set ups there are also edited interview clips of hitoto asano and hsiao hsien as well as the film s trailer 
__label__0 i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p o d it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b c i didn t want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie b c the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck b c it s not until then the movie turn s into a horror don t bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls 
__label__0 superman ii the richard donner cut should be a fan s dream come true at long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage alternates from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn t convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you ll believe a man can fly it s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn t make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense lester s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly part of this could be because donner didn t get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by donner but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing while lester honored the donner material lester here is thrown under the bus so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that s neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie cooper s back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts it s just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates they should have used more of lester s footage but probably had too much pride to admit that the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation xk 10 while we all know it s the xk 101 a blind man in stm knows that the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner s didn t make this a separate release here in the states as it is we re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for lester s version it s by no means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history 
__label__1 a lot has already been said on this movie and i d like to join those who praised it it s a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres drama comedy gangster film without making a mess of it at points you just laugh out loud at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch sabu s genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie one is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street this sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well it is erotic and funny at the same time another example of sabu s genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired first one of them the typical loser among the three guys hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving all of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again and at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other running in line just laughing so here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which sabu manages to show throughout the film his characters fail do they at the end but he doesn t rob them of their dignity monday and postman blues that do justice to sabu s claim that he is a genius go watch them 
__label__0 a rating of 1 does not begin to express how dull depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is 
__label__1 a first time director bromell has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged middle class depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature david dorfman as the 6 year old son of william h macy is the most refreshing little actor i ve seen in awhile macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business it s always great to see donald sutherland and here he s wonderful as the callous father of macy the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast locations and filmed the movie the basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he s a fan of contradiction 
__label__1 my what a director s intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions young mr lincoln is filled up with some old fashioned values which in retrospect despite its two dimensional portrayal is at least more respectably done than one might see in the pap in current cinema what makes it work so extremely well as it does in all its simplicity and grandeur is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the guise of a history lesson we all know of abraham lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the civil war got assassinated but as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic funny in the most unexpected places and a true gentleman he s not some superhero that can do no wrong which was fonda s only apprehension to the part before signing on but a figure with possible flaws that are surpassed by his innate goodness and clear sight of right and wrong it s suffice to say that john ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying actually it s a lie he does try but he makes it sort of effortless in the studio system he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously zanuck so he was pretty much left alone to his own succinct practices in editing in camera and not moving it around so as to not waver far off from the story it s this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material as a kind of companion piece to the full blooded americana in 1939 as seen in mr smith goes to washington only here it s the law and not politics fonda is terrific in the lead his first with ford and never lets us loose sight of lincoln past the make up and extra boost in the shoes fonda s own personality in a sense as it would in grapes of wrath and my darling clementine comes out in the character of lincoln however unlikely it might be there s no one else from this period that could have played him then he s mature and wise but has the gumption to prove himself in this case of a convoluted he saw that but did she murder case only in little bits and pieces like that final shot which superimposes lincoln walking down the road with his monument and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on seem pretty dated as far as the goals set out with young mr lincoln there were all met by ford and his crew and cast it s not as hokey as one might think going in and it s got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos 
__label__1 the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in 1990 the other being the more well known grifters after dark has all of thompson s hallmarks dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless jason patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring director james foley uses raging bull esquire sequences to flesh out the back story and the too little seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance but bruce dern is the film s secret weapon his sweet talking grifter uncle bud subtly commands each of his scenes there s almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void 
__label__0 christ a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time this at least has the decency to leave out the songs bar a reprise of the unbearable tomorrow but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny this time annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins s plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is every time the little bugger squeals leapin lizards i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder drearily photographed slushy and plodding the movie has only one memorable line unhand me you stupid genius and the fact that it s not the original to recommend it 
__label__0 i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society i didn t expect spike lee to force feed me more garbage on racial tension mob justice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers lee has presented an extreme opinion the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90 min format with more focus less tangential sub plots don t even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee in such a case the theatre is worth it this is not an escapist movie 
__label__0 quite honestly the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat trying to decide if i should demand a refund but since i hadn t paid to see it in the first place passes i figured i might as well stay and i didn t think it could possibly get any worse it did i will quickly run through the low points includes some spoilers the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane a motivational speaker with two phds the characterization was inconsistent for example lane despite his credentials is a complete nitwit then there s the lame o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code also terrible action sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger it turns out to be a dream sequence that s cute for grammar school writing assignments but it s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture the pacing was bad after a long opener the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds later the pacing improves but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around and as someone else mentioned years pass yet no one not even lane s young daughter ages that was disconcerting there are a few good things though the quality of the film e g lack of graininess is high and very attractive the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism also there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god finally to help him this proved to be quite exhilarating even to me someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie unfortunately it was followed by major incomprehensibility the characters dialogue direction and acting were all poorly done michael ironside had nothing to do and michael york was just weird i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused and the characterization more fleshed out the film would have been far better in a nutshell the omega code disappoints definitely do not pay to see this i give it out of ten stars 
__label__0 the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable but krista allen really rocked in the movie her voice was so seducing and sexy the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do krista really is one of the best in such roles she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes which is the interesting part of the movie burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star he could have chosen a better script than this ireally think he did for money 
__label__1 this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza the kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses the movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness if you ve only seen miikes far out movies ichi the killer fudoh etc this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy and as always with miike there are at least two scenes in this that you ll never forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself 8 10
__label__0 this is only somewhat attractive for fans of bad movie entertainment it is more worthwhile for students of 1970 s pop culture the fashions the furniture the attitudes and that great women s lib moment of the early 1970 s when it was still fresh and novel for a self employed independent woman to exist superchick joyce jillson had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career after all what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30 000 feet that goes for the male ones too she slept around with multiple men could protect herself and others with karate and wasn t tied down to anything this is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti feminists those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband the sexy stewardess was a potent archetype of the late 1960 s to 1970 s geez even on the partridge family i remember swinging bachelor ruben kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses and from that point of view this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre aids free love women s lib swinging seventies the plot is quite awful though and for those cavemen in the audience there are few bare breasts to look at

__label__0 the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 s soap opera deeply character driven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the villain s dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable self effacing crumpled self and the bride kidnap victim is a whimpering one dimensional damsel in distress she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor come on i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you know what in 2 seconds in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of reality the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours 
__label__1 the danes character finally let s buddy have the awful truth leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long nice girl this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film wait a minute this irony is intended this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes but somehow i doubt that s what the creators of this film had in mind sadly maybe there are a few mistakes after all 
__label__0 hubert selby jr gave us the book requiem for a dream and co wrote the screenplay to aronofsky s movie of it that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did the film seems laughably anti gay at times especially when in the film homosexuality equals death one gay character gets stoned is launched skyward by a speeding car and lands dead on the pavement another is crucified and still more are simply beat up another exaggerated piece of shock value that might actually have been compelling if it were done well are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike breakers who d have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions the director uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director but he is far below the cut for real movies the film is clunky that can t even seem to settle on a genre lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead a loathsome hooker named tralala believe it or not i m not joking her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits a failure 
__label__1 i believe i received this film when i was a young buck i remembered watching it as a child but i could never find the film i remembered good ol rageddy ann andy babette the greedy king koo koo i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it we were reunited i am 17 years old now i still watch it all the time actually it s one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time and personally i think they should make a sequel mmm yes a sequel indeed now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body 
__label__1 joshua seftel s first film a satire of memorable proportions is about just as the title suggests the corporations effect on war the film is about a mercenary john cusack traveling to turaqistan not a real country fyi to help the american government get their message across to turaqistan s leaders he meets a reporter marisa tomei and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man a hot reporter somewhere in the mix a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan s most important people a son of the president a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star well somewhat the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar no more than fifteen seconds later the film hooks you with it s amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics the film s running time blows by you the film has a lot more action than i expected with the occasional scene of war well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder though the story isn t much deep the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike in the final act of the film the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled i thought it was executed very well but other may disagree and i could understand why twist after twist is what the ending is all about and like most films it is a true hit miss situation regardless the three writers on the film mark leyner jeremy pikser john cusack did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today s situation overseas joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film s integrity not reducing the material to the most redundant of films which i was afraid would happen seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could he created a vibrant atmosphere one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities contrasting them perfectly as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely no missteps here hopefully he takes on more directorial jobs for he is one director to look out for 
__label__1 it s all about mitzi i loved her in this and didn t she look fantastic i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times the richard character was completely creepy i ve dated guys like that well not totally like that lol i wish zack hadn t have gotten killed he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes i love these stalker type stories it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked my husband doesn t usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it i can t wait to see what mitzi does next 
__label__0 originally called the changer the nostril picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe bukowski carl zschering who likes em young unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special vietnamese chant this chant involves whistling london bridge is falling down whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer nonetheless ugly joe tries it out and hey presto he is now a girl ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls but lets not talk about ideals here this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 in an ideal world it should have never been released the film asylum dubbed this horror hokum as mind numbing ham handed story telling its worse than that the nostril picker really takes the biscuit in fact the whole god damn cookie jar terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain dead actors a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist just when things couldn t get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent for instance joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself but i thought he wanted to get close to them not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims of which there were only around 3 4 the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker steven andrews then taking her back to his apartment what happens next defies belief joe turns back into a man but also discovers the hooker is a man how does he react well in a benny hill esquire fashion he chases her around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo s only to trip up on a blow up doll god knows what patrick j matthews and stephen hodge were thinking of at least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment this involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2 bit joke shop cop uniform the hilarious acting is a must see especially the hooker s inability at saying dildo and his demand for satisfaction apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore you know a movie s bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting normally i d fast forward to the good bits only there weren t any here the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly forget quick cuts matthews utilizes fadeouts one during a stab scene to limit any form of suspense there might already be one girl s non reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable normally i d relish the words uncut but in this case they were far from a blessing just more agonizing cinematic torture the whole movie felt like an unedited episode of midsummer murders only less entertaining i d hate to see the cut version to sum up the nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i ve seen since richard hammond s 5 o clock show dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing don t be fooled by the box label this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets use shitty horror dvds for coffee coasters cult which i think it does unless re edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess 
__label__1 you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period this is a very chilling story even though it doesn t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and it s this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 it s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it s scary too this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end 
__label__0 first of all yes animals have emotions if you didn t know that already then i believe you are a moron but let s assume that none of us are morons we all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature correct what we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human the filmmakers search high low for footage of animals engaged in human like behaviour and when it happens they say that monkey is almost human that s actually a direct quote everything is in human terms they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs smile but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat i had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages but instead researchers keep falling back on pedantic anthropomorphic observations and assumptions add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps celebrating christmas and this was enough to turn my stomach but it doesn t end there half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language want out hurry go obscure references are made to stress tests and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a mother figure and after 40 years of experiments the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion monkeys have emotions one chimp named washoe has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose and to this day she remains thus we get a brief glimpse again through bars of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression personally i don t need to see any further experimental data washoe i apologize for our entire species 
__label__1 poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure you re in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life 
__label__0 i m glad some people liked this but i hated this film it had a very good idea for a story line but that s where it ended it was badly written badly acted and badly made it had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross instead it was what s going on 5 seconds later they tell you this film had no suspense and i was bored from start to end i just wanted it to finish go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end 
__label__0 what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick do not waste your time on this film 
__label__0  it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when charlie s fiancé goes out of town he s stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch 
__label__0  shut it off the prologue with fu manchu s birthday and the opening credits of the assassins training is amusing then it drops off faster than hair sprayed with neat look for a cameo by cato in the beginning with a figurative wink at the audience 
__label__0 reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice tremblay s supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it s audience i didn t hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it s page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn t seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper l odyssée d alice tremblay is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you 
__label__0 a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit run the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper how festive only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch so it s up to dad to say the day this late 70 s made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail biter but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that it s merely lame boring and not really well acted in the least bit my grade d
__label__0 i cringed all the way through this movie first of all the idiotic plot has little to do with parson s own story hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie imagine englebert sings hendrix do not take anything about this movie to be accurate the name parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the parsons legacy and his fan base gram s father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with grams life or death if you are a gram fan i advise you to not see this movie i wish i hadn t it s saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder i d swear i could hear gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing if you are not familiar with gram s life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of gram i cannot say enough bad things about this movie if gram were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself then again maybe he d be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result 
__label__0 there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good one liners delivered very nicely by alice krige but then again she is alice krige her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense what so ever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored don t waste any time on this one 
__label__0 although this is generally a cheesy jungle adventure movie it does have some highlights the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good you won t be bored watching it keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghai d into escorting rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country he never takes things seriously shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her she doesn t really have to act much she s not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a t a picture there s nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it produced to be shlock it succeeds without too much fuss a good 2 am cable programmer 
__label__0 the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german post war movies it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet however the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie which is a direct copy of the cover of pearl harbor luise kielberg bettina zimmermann gets to hear that her husband who is a doctor ulrich noethen has died in russia and after the war she s struggling to survive she finds a job at the american base gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer heino ferch in town falls in love with m gets pregnant and all of a sudden her husband turns up again come on we ve seen this once too often heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince for some reason it always seems she s somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes it just didn t work for me the action scenes with the planes and the air lift we re sometimes exciting more often not nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot unless you re a big fan of wwii movies i suggest you spend your money on something else chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction 4 out 10 
__label__0 this movie is easily the worst of the series though new line might just be looking at sales they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3d ending it wasn t that the 3 d was good either because it was 50 s 3d with the red and blue lenses anaglyph it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like beyond that this movie was so poorly done bad script bad characters bad acting worse directing this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a looney tunes episode seriously not for horror audience because it is corny and not scary and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film 
__label__1 so i m at home flipping channels one night and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup standing in front of a colored background on hbo naturally i did a double take and decided i d watch for a little while i didn t change the channel until he was finished it was so incredibly hilarious the next time it was on i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch during the first couple of minutes you can tell that the audience isn t quite sure what to think but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit while many stand up comedians mesh together in my brain eddie izzard stands out as one of the best his style is incredibly refreshing and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events his show stayed with me afterwards i went to italy over the summer and all i could think about while i was there was how italians are always on scooters going ciao 10 out of 10 see it you won t regret it 
__label__0 i thought this film would be a lot better then it was it sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener and the start of it reminded me of pleasantvil but this film came up short the plot is just to ridiculous the kgb and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies how to act like americans but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated so they grab two yanks from the us to spice things up i don t know but this seems just to out there it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent someone screwed up in the casting job also for a comedy this is painfully dry there is one two funny spots tops and they are nothing to sing and dance about the film in the end will likely put you to sleep and as a twisted punch in the face this film is so pro the us it makes me sick the movie keeps on saying again and again the us is god and russia is the devil this is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the japanese in world war 2 it s films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself this gets a 4 out of 10 and i m being kind it should really get a one but the dance scene was funny but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny 
__label__0 oh my god oh my god i cant get over this movie it was god awful horrible terrible don t even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bin no avoid it at all costs i m warning you it was the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life in my life first of all g girl are you kidding me get real that sounds like some kind of new barbie doll super women are you kidding me it was so fake fake fake fake the people of the town didn t even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just zooming her way around the town saving a fire ohh big jesus was it just me or did this movie seem offensive i guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double d s blonde flowing hair no glasses and a leather skin tight suit if it was trying to be romantic than god i don t know it was horrid if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed and in the air than they totally had love it was pathetic everything went too fast first that guy was single than he was dating g girl than they broke up than he dated that hannah girl and it just goes on i have to say this movie made me wonder how the hell did they get this in theaters avoid this movie at all costs 
__label__0 first let me state that i do not believe in god if you want to use the word atheist fine but i don t like that word since it describes what i m not not what i am but i hated this documentary the production values were damn near non existent the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian flemming s insecurities the production values were terrible and brian flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best the narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot and he didn t practice at all there were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie animation was also pretty damn bad the whole idea that jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars as i stated before i do not believe in god and i don t think that whether or not jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of god my personal view jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah s look up apollonius of tiana and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death according to the wikipedia article on the historicity of jesus and there s a good citation for this so it s garbage virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that jesus was a jewish teacher from galilee who was regarded as a healer was baptized by john the baptist was accused of sedition against the roman empire and on the orders of roman governor pontius pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion 1 i was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director s insecurities than anything else i was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else the most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal he s not even coy about it the way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while i agree with the director partially that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing the way that flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going if he was more tactile with his interview instead he comes off aggressive with isn t it bad to teach kids this stuff the guy cuts the interview short and i mean what did he expect the principal to say oh yes i see it is i have seen the light this will now be a secular school it seems that flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood this isn t about the documentary this is about flemming s insecurities and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary flemming shows what he s really doing here and that is the real downfall of this so called documentary 
__label__1 years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it it s a marvelous spoof of soaps with jealousies the usual actors insecurities and all sorts of lovely excesses but more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but it s marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes i ll throw it on while doing housecleaning and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many congrats to all who made it 
__label__0 yes i have rated this film as one star awful yet it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth this truly is so bad it s good this is another k gordon murray production read buys a really cheap bad mexican movie spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matinées in the mid 1960 s it s a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as i m sure some mood enhancers would make this an even better experience i m not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said a christmas movie with merlin the devil mechanical wind up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammar s a christmas carol truly a holiday experience made in hell now if i can only find to all a goodnight aka slayride on dvd i ll have a triple feature that can t be beat you have to see this movie it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button especially on the two dance routines this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience feliz navidad amigos 
__label__0 this is a typical 70 s soft core sex romp in the russ meyer genre though perhaps less outlandish than some of meyer s work this film has higher production values than many of it s contemporaries suggesting a larger budget it s plot writing and acting are straight out the b zone though of late this film has become a mainstay of b movie channels such as drive in classics in the 500 channel universe if soft core is what you are in the mood for this is as good as anything else in the b range don t expect polanski though sarno is just sarno nothing more nothing less jennifer welles performance as the mother is perhaps the best of the cast none of the actors in the film went on to greater fame unsurprisingly confessions of a young american housewife is far from the worst example of it s kind it is watchable if this is your type of film 30 years ago this would have been an avant garde and riske film you can see more or less the same kind of thing on showtime hbo series these days and in prime time 
__label__1 the film starts out very slowly with the lifestyle of wallace napalm an attendant at a photo service drop off station his wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department and takes firefighting seriously as we watch wallace s rather dull life proceeding suddenly there comes something new and jarring a traveling carnival comes to town one of its stars is wilder napalm wallace s brother he s a clown but he has a special talent so does wallace they re both pyrokineticists or pyrotics people capable of starting fires through mental energy wallace keeps his powers secret wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do spoiler some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a vagrant wallace holds back from using his powers wilder wants to go public on national tv complicating the matter wilder wants wallace s wife whom they both dated years earlier she becomes a bone of contention and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal firefight the film is entertaining but not laugh out loud funny i think enough of it to have a copy in my library it s a good offbeat film 
__label__1 james cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot soft characters in his career this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it he plays the role with a lot of confidence he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time so it actually isn t a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in the movie is directed by lloyd bacon who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre his earliest 30 s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as 42nd street his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really 30 s musicals never were really about its singing this was something that more featured in 40 s and later made musicals mainly from the mgm studios as usual it has a light and simple story set in the musical world that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch so do the characters and actors that are portraying them sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done even though i m not a too big fan of the genre itself once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty he often played little boys babies mice and whatever more early on in his career including the movie musical gold diggers of 1933 of one year earlier a recommendable early genre movie 8 10
__label__1 this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style and extremely worthy of stay alive for me it is he best example of film noire since chinatown it will unfortunately never get the recognition it deserves it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental referrals i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot 
__label__0 by all accounts this could have been an interesting film featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as the future of british horror i expected alex chandon s gore fest to live up to the hype i was wrong everything about this film is either cliche or inept the short story anthology setup was done to death and much better in the seventies and eighties admittedly the idea of the sick room did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting chandon cannot write dialogue every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence the typical cop on the edge formula funny i m sure i ve seen that somewhere else before no chandon you are not tarantino or scorsese it sounds bad add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting don t get me wrong dani filth is a great singer and musician but actor he ain t and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing give me bruce campbell any day the visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious cgi awful gore effects for goodness sakes peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget and editing filters that shriek over use as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth s score man they should sue the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects eg maniac zombie flesh eaters the beyond suspiria etc rendering cradle of fear in my mind second rate and obsolete i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares better luck next time 
__label__0  i m a cartoon you re an illustration what does that suppose to mean this plot could not be worse as a boy who s afraid of everything becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read when a cheaper and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts even the talents of macaulay culkin as the kid christopher lloyd as the so predictable that he s a the page master librarian could save this pointless film from the dull plot even the voices of whoopi goldberg patrick stewart even leonard nimoy or the hollywood god of voices frank welker as the cartoon characters don t save it ever i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies because the bland animation makes the film worse not improving the dull plot 
__label__1 the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written of course non believers will say its only a sci fi movie truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view if you are a fan of classic thrillers omen etc this is one of them and its a must have i never saw the sequel distant thunder but i believe it picks up where this movie ends 
__label__0 this movie makes peter an elf in robin hood costume instead of a human boy in probably not robin hood costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter this movie makes wendy a babbling idiot and poor captain hook a total clown and of course as every disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head they made one of the lost boys that one the only character that has not been disgraced in this film is tink the only star is for her the story itself then the darling parents don t even get the time to notice their kids are gone probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it also the famous nursery scene between peter pan and wendy is a stunning piece of there are no thimbles and no acorns one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one it s a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal so know now if you haven t known it before this disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story which is not really a children s story but just a great great story this just annoys me to no end 
__label__1 the film notes describe the main role family as turkish immigrants which living in denmark however it is so clear to understand that the fact is the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute kurdish similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on turkey today on kurdish ethnicity societies what a worry it is widely accepted issue in turkey today the kurdish immigrants living in european countries today which have moved from turkey at 70 s are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system by growing daughters and women under pressure are giving harm to the turkish international image also as same as widely accepted another issue is the turkish or kurdish immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the community europe nominee 
__label__1 this is definatley one of the best stand up shows evre ever eddie is so off the wall that i ve been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks it s a masterpeice you need look no further than this line the word herb you say erb and we say herb cuz ther s a f ing h in it brilliant 
__label__0 movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists new family moves in cue the overwritten dialog mediocre acting green jello salad with shredded carrots and every other inside mormon joke known to man anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there you ll be much better off watching hess s other movies napoleon dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one the acting is mediocre jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like saints and soldiers and napoleon dynamite i would recommend both movies over this groaner 
__label__1 this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i ve ever seen closely followed by none other than before sunset which technically isn t another movie at all since it s about the same two people and the same romance this is love in the real world ok that s only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog based movies as well and this is what makes before sunrise so good the dialog is perfect it s so real so engaging and funny it s hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love coz you fall in love with them at the very same time my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend it s perfect brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life i must say that if you have a choice do watch before sunrise before watching before sunset if like me you watched sunset first it s hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show once again the greatest romantic movie in my books wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations young love at it s best 
__label__1 this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken s classic tale the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice george c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser something rarely done in other versions the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen 
__label__0 when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don t understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two aa size batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society 
__label__1 2 words academy award nuff said this film had everything in it comedy to make me laugh drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival breakin 2 electric boogaloo the acting was tip top of any independant film jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show his lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker i thought i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington when the line my bus it s gone that was the true turning point of the movie my grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond through thick being held up at knife point and thin nathan giving tony tips on women the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer hollywood

__label__1 arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill eikenberry are in conversation frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him secondly though i actually knew a real life arthur bach he was not quite as wealthy as arthur but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid his parents tightly controlled his purse strings but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in greenwich village he spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself just like dudley moore does the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not but that s the other half of the equation my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him in fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming he couldn t buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor he spent his life being a perfect party guest the term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him and that s what dudley moore is a wastrel unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him that s a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur my friend also never found a liza minnelli a male liza minnelli in fact because he was gay still moore s portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for me arthur 20th century wastrel is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in jill eikenberry since he won t work for a living the threat of being cut off is quite real for him he only has his butler hobson played by john gielgud and chauffeur bitterman played by ted post to pour his troubles out to we should all have such troubles john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time the academy gave henry fonda and katharine hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime that man was amazing still at his craft almost to the end so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie weiss a genuine real life arthur i dedicate this review 
__label__1 this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf but it came on ifc one day and i said eric stolz william forsythe why not if i d changed the channel i would have really missed a treasure the subject is depressing young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower class rehabilitation center it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear jerker but that doesn t happen because it was written by neal jimenez after he himself was accidently paralyzed no hollywood happiness here all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds but they share a feeling of helplessness of being at the mercy of others stolz is very good as a lone wolf type forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend helen hunt wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies man whose family is falling apart but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence see this film 
__label__0 i m sorry to report that i have seen this film several times when it bombed at the box office it was repeated nightly for about a month on hbo and i watched it over and over because television in general is so bad or was at that time i no longer watch so it might be wonderful now like samuel l jackson says about swine it might taste like sweet potato pie but i ll never know because i wouldn t eat the filthy mfer let s see dudley plays arthur wandering in the desert always a few steps behind moses it came out right after life of bryan so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from the few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth there s one scene where arthur and dom deluise meet in the desert both of them dragged out and dessicated dying of thirst then they meet like old acquaintances who didn t really know each other very well promise to do lunch it could have been funny but the scene that i remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full king tut regalia he must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release they overdubbed his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe kid dyno wannabe or it might have been jimmy walker who knows who cares they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist very unfunny very long piece of excrement one of those legendary things that just won t flush no matter how many times you try so you leave it there for someone else to deal with well that s my review if you rent this movie don t buy it whatever you do prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of corona now that they ve remade the poseiden adventure this one is probably high on the list for remakes maybe they ll hire a comedy writer this time 
__label__0 down to earth 2001 out of four by blake french down to earth is such a mislead and desperate comedy it makes sitting home on the couch watching a chris rock standup comedy act on tv look like heaven speaking of heaven the film is based on the 1978 movie heaven can wait that was a good movie and this is good to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage directors chris and paul weitz miss nearly every target from concept to storytelling down to earth fails miserably this is one incredibly bad production chris rock is a lousy standup comedian both in his role in this movie and in the real life he plays lance barton whose manager frankie faison even feels sorry for him when he is booed off stage during amateur night at a local theatre soon after the script establishes his lack of talent the character is killed by a speeding truck death played by eugene levy has made a mistake taking lance before his number was up god s assistant chazz palminteri is very angry and decides to let lance make up the remainder of his time on earth as long as he takes the only available body of a 60 year old white millionaire the old man s name is mr wellington whose life has problems of its own his wife jennifer coolidge is having an affair with his assistant greg germann who is robbing him of his money but that s all right because lance inside mr wellington has fallen in love with a young black woman named sontee regina king meanwhile there are plots to kill wellington lance attempting to get a better body and sontee s confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving mr wellington s finances down to earth has some good ideas but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material the biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive lance as mr wellington chris rock is the actor with popularity and publicity so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie all of the characters see the new lance as mr wellington but we see him as chris rock this is convenient for the love story we believe a young woman would fall for lance but in reality he is actually an old gray haired geezer that is not so convincing the one joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man but what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge just look at there s something about mary in the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences and not at their will here lance knows he is in an old man s body and does things old men would not normally do if lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential another problem with the concept we never knew mr wellington in the first place so how can we compare lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally to top everything off chris rock needs to be the center of attention here and makes the character too much like rock he recites simple standup routine jokes that are tedious and painful his dialogue is so obvious wooden and straightforward i hated the film s sense of humor there are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations it is like watching chris rock being chris rock not a character in a movie let s emphasize the positives in down to earth mark addy does not do any worse here than he did in the flintstones in viva rock vegas eugene levy and chazz palmentari are well cast but they are at the mercy of a scalped script those are all the good qualities i can mention at this time and if you give me another week to recollect it is not likely that i will come up with any more 
__label__0 i didn t know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didn t i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film 
__label__1 military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves among the more prominent we have officer and a gentleman top gun gi jane and now men of honor the fact that this one happened to be true doesn t change the fact that the formula is the same this film is probably most like gi jane since it focuses on the desegregation angle the story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human interest story among those mentioned above carl brashear cuba gooding jr is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film unfortunately director george tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than brashear in favor of showing brashear in a constant state of adversity billy sunday robert de niro is a central figure and except for the initial scene the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife we don t know much about him for instance brashear sees the scars on sunday s palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow but there is no follow up on that point mr pappy hal holbrook gets only one short scene by which we can judge him the rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting if a director is going to make a human interest story he needs to humanize the characters cuba gooding jr gives an outstanding performance as brashear this is probably the best i ve seen him this is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before and he rises to the occasion in jerry maguire rod tidwell was a fascinating but one dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle brashear is much more complex and grounded and the issues he faces are life crises making the part far more challenging this is an excellent recovery from gooding s last role in chill factor a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part after a stint trying his hand as a comedian analyze this the adventures of rocky bullwinkle meet the parents robert deniro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance deniro isn t a bad comedian he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn t waste his time doing comedy deniro endows billy sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul it is a pleasure watching him work it seems every film i watch lately has charlize theron in it i saw the legend of bagger vance men of honor and the yards right in a row and i was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 actually she only did five this was a minor role for theron but she carried it off well and managed to stay with deniro step for step david keith who co starred with richard gere in officer and a gentleman has a cameo herethe dvd has some interesting special features including reflections by the real carl brashear and some deleted scenes i enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one dimensional presentation i rated it a 7 10 i m a sucker for underdog stories and i have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme this film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director s shortcomings 
__label__0 this tear teaser written by steve martin himself is so unbelievably bad it makes you sick to your stomach the plot is pathetic the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending avoid at all costs 
__label__0 there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee carl franklin billy dukes denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry then there are the wayans brothers who at one time 15 years ago had an extremely funny television show in living colour that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags toilet humour as the standard operating procedure people are not as stupid as those portrayed in little man they couldn t possibly be a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old baby comes with a five o clock shadow that he shaves off it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands darryl s back oh yea that is just hilarious as a master criminal little man is the stupidest on planet earth he stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman s purse and then has to pursue her co star chazz palminteri why chazz offers the best line i m surrounded by morons based without credit on a chuck jones cartoon baby buggy bunny this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night prior to the bat awards and he did not even mention this dreadful movie when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers when they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood 
__label__0 this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t v movie the film lacks what velvet goldmine had which was good acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the worst writing i ve seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be interesting i know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn t and feel flat on it s face 
__label__1 i don t understand your objections to this movie it is a taut thrilling extension of the character created in basic instinct the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that sharon stone s character is still alive and not in jail at this late date spoiler alert as the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on 1 sharon stone s character is killing all these people because she s crazy risk addicted 2 david thewlis crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stone s character 3 david morrissey s analyst is killing these people for revenge what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop the only killing that occurs on screen i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 a space odyssey who cares what is real the blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge what s important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie get over it 
__label__0 in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe i can t see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who s afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn t always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens 
__label__0 oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie i have ever seen the acting is bad the story is weak the characters are weaker and the whole film just doesn t make sense couple this with mediocre directing really strange scenes such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in and thoroughly abysmal dialog look musta peed his pants and you get one complete failure not to mention the fact that the only thing mr atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars but this is part of the movie s charm sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh i love this movie because it s just so bad 
__label__0 well ok i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say i actually think this movie is good this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie isn t that bad i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick this movie is not half bad it has some scares and some really hot women i might add plus it shows off joey lawrence s new beefy look though obviously even that hasn t won him any big hollywood roles either i feel bad for the man he had such a career in the early and mid 90 s with blossom some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene but then like in a 360 degree turn his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one the movie also throws you off guard in it makes you think between the crew there really is a secret that someone knows to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret it also throws you off on who the killer is i had an idea but still woulnd t think the killer was who he was but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown now had there been a secret that was let out this movie could ve been one of the better b rated movies but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie a so so slasher flick good for a midnight movie 
__label__0 the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael played impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all it s a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future 
__label__1 i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting the script the direction and the general feeling of this movie it s been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter reflect from sadness and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work we need more movies like this mike binder are you listening 
__label__1 this is definitely one of jet s best efforts few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can the action is rapid fire and special effects boosted for intensity purposes as a result it may take americans a little off guard a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet s work and look forward to further masterpieces especially fist of legend making it into the us market a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts 
__label__1 this movie is good for tv i like it because i m a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film accuracy on the film from the book is half and half they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser the the car scene involving the hatch family running away from the tornado wasn t in the book instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety and in the book dan and his friend are both 12 years old thats all i can think of overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small nebraska town in 1980 
__label__1 when i started watching the show i said oh no it s as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody and indeed the setup is almost identical with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him but this is where the resemblance stops the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few the magical setup is a bit corny because it s about seven people with seven servants fighting for the holy grail all servants being someone famous half of all masters being from the same school rules of engagement etc however this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and without comparing it with animes that i liked more but were from other genres i have to say that i was very pleased 
__label__1 how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even beleiving it wouldn t utlimately this is the film s greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid 90s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for 
__label__0 this movie is just horrible it s boring it s low quality the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it s hilarious the main actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls but he s ugly overweight and looks like he s from the early 90 s all the characters are away for the week end for a get together amongst friends but nobody are actually friends the married couple hasn t seen the main guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren t really friends the date of the main guy only knows him from work and than there s a girl they pick up at a bar now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week end at your cabin with people that aren t even your real friends because that s what he does at the beginning of the movie do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon i ve made home movies scarier than this 
__label__0 peter sellers plays dick scratcher ha ha a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one although he s witnessed a treasure being buried he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank thus dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts do you place an ad for that and help lead a path to the treasure it s mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director and given medak s talents in the film the ruling class you can probably guess which of the grainy poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director s chair peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film s first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain he s probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned so that he can keep this off his resume franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power behind scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate with even sellers makeup and hair looking quite terrible they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it with lines like these i can understand any possible unease pierre about to be hanged you ll pay for this scratcher no i won t i ll do it for free and that s one of the good jokes it s amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well received british tv program a show called fred starring sellers milligan and directed by the great richard lester :P
__label__1 the one of the most remarkable sci fi movies of the millennium not only a movie but an incredible future vision this movie establishes a new standard of s f movies hail and kill 
__label__0 okay if you have a couple hours to waste or if you just really hate your life i would say watch this movie if anything it s good for a few laughs not only do you have obese topless natives but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states seriuosly the rating of pg is pretty humorous too once you see the native porn extravaganza i wouldn t give this movie to my retarded nephew you couldn t even show this to iraqi prisoners without violating the geneva convention the plot is sketchy and cliché and dumb and stupid the acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen 
__label__1 i m far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3 which is an almost inexistent small role and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad even though i feared the worst when gabe stallone fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top he can t possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger for almost a year he doesn t set a food in the reserve but than he returns soon after he s back they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm at least that s what the rangers believe in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever but in its genre it s an enjoyable one i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers i know him best from the tv series 3rd rock from the sun but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well overall the acting is ok it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one liners but it also offered a very nice decor this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment i loved the snowy mountains and valleys the mountain rivers and the forests perhaps that s why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action adventure movie of this kind i give it a 6 5 10 if you don t expect too much this is an enjoyable movie 
__label__0 friz freleng s speedy gonzalez was the second cartoon to feature the title character after robert mckimson s cat tails for two in that cartoon speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted despite looking significantly more handsome speedy never developed into much of a character a big hat tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make and that s pretty much all speedy ever had going for him nevertheless the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio s latter days while these early speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently rather oddly paired up with daffy duck they still leave much to be desired relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula in this self titled episode speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by sylvester the cat although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon sylvester s role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat his personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable undemanding role of pursuer this was always a problem in the tweety cartoons too but speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture poor old sylvester would be forced to appear alongside speedy for many years to come despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs speedy gonzalez won an oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born 
__label__0 the thing that really gets me about this movie that is the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill is that someone actually paid to have it made there is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie it is not frightening it is not thought provoking it is not entertaining it is not good it is a sleeping pill made of cyanide the dvd case compares it to blair witch evil dead and a few other decent movies making the filmmaker s desperation glaringly obvious it is nothing like any other movie ever made it is far far worse the claims of an extremely shocking ending you will never forget are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash because it may make you sterile the man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the writer s guild membership list and never allowed to film anything again because if he thought this was a movie worth making he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future zero stars may grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this i am going to go vomit now 
__label__1 blood castle aka scream of the demon lover altar of blood ivanna the best but least exploitation cinema sounding title and so on is a very traditional gothic romance film that means that it has big creepy castles a headstrong young woman a mysterious older man hints of horror and the supernatural and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term it also means that it is very deliberately paced and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement if you love films like robert wise s the haunting 1963 but you also have a taste for late 1960s early 1970s spanish and italian horror you may love blood castle as well baron janos dalmar carlos quiney lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional unspecified european village the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman she soon after ends up dead the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy appetite for women at the beginning of the film yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated meanwhile dr ivanna rakowsky erna schürer has appeared in the center of the village asking to be taken to baron dalmar s castle she s an out of towner who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry of course no one wants to go near the castle finally ivanna finds a shady individual who becomes even shadier to take her once there an odd woman who lives in the castle olga cristiana galloni rejects ivanna and says that she shouldn t be there since she s a woman baron dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay she ends up staying but somewhat reluctantly the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns which the baron s brother igor is suffering from unfortunately the baron s brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre blackish liquid and furthermore ivanna is having bizarre hallucinatory dreams just what is going on at the castle is the baron responsible for the crimes is he insane i wanted to like blood castle more than i did as i mentioned the film is very deliberate in its pacing and most of it is very understated i can go either way on material like that i don t care for the haunting yes i m in a very small minority there but i m a big fan of 1960s and 1970s european horror one of my favorite directors is mario bava i also love dario argento s work from that period but occasionally blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times there are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle but the atmosphere of the film is decent director josé luis merino managed more than passable sets and locations and they re shot fairly well by emanuele di cola however blood castle feels relatively low budget and this is a roger corman produced film after all which usually means a low budget though often surprisingly high quality quickie so while there is a hint of the lushness of bava s colors and complex set decoration everything is much more minimalist of course it doesn t help that the retromedia print i watched looks like a 30 year old photograph that s been left out in the sun too long it appears washed out with compromised contrast still merino and di cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals for example a scene of ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that s shot from an exaggerated angle and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only there are also a couple ingmar bergmanesque shots where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame the performances are fairly good and the women especially schürer are very attractive merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres with english titles such as sex life in a woman s prison 1974 naked and lustful 1974 strip nude for your killer 1975 and erotic exploits of a sexy seducer 1977 blood castle is much tamer but in addition to the nudity there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage and of course the scenes mixing sex and death the primary attraction here though is probably the story which is much a slow burning romance as anything else the horror elements the mystery elements and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses but in the end blood castle is a love story about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms often with physical threats or harms to be together 
__label__1 i participate in a filmmaker s symposium and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion even though it was incredibly late and we were weary the entire audience really enjoyed it personally i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots and i loved the quirky cast of characters they really grow on you in the film 
__label__0 i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child porn which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically i would liken this movie to a recipe that s been torn in half it s kind of like being handed a list of ingredients with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product from the start character development and story development are lacking unfortunately many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think ahh ok finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on or who this character is or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more or understand and get involved more with this inter character relationship etc but no such luck on the contrary many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled only to find that whatever mini plot within whatever mini plot and that poorly presented was just a ruse why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2 1 2 stars another mystery it s not that the characters aren t likable to some degree or that you can t identify with them or their humanness at all it s just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone s film school project i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half 
__label__1 cinderella i hadn t watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it the magic remains there is something that definitely contains that storybook feel the songs entertain and the secondary character s all please the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile then there is the most magical of all disney the mice making the dress and well you know the rest to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience watch and enjoy oh and of course cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm with elene wood and others the movie has such a feel to it you simply can t help but smilethey say the moral of this story is that dreams come true of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper s in this film it s even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling and of course the rest is cinderella
__label__0 i think jason lee has huge potential but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star the plot is awful the comedy is awful i laughed twice i think for relief because in retrospect they were fairly lame jokes i found myself scared for the future of fletch and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed not lee julia stiles and selma blair are hot but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out instead of this film save your time 1 star 
__label__1 i watched this movie every chance i got back in the seventies when it came out on cable it was my introduction to harlem which has fascinated me and bill clinton ever since i was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up trying to decide whom they wanted to be and making some bad choices as well as good ones i was dazzled by lonette mckee s beauty the great dresses they eventually got to wear and the snappy dialogue as someone being raised by a single mother as well i could really identify with these girls and their lives it s funny these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles 
__label__0 outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk his show is terrible nothing about lopez has ever been funny i have watched his stand up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh his stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them this guy has a grudge that won t end i feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes might be why this show is always on at 2am in replay 
__label__1 i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted however i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she is the script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and castinga must must watch movie for everyone
__label__0 i saw this film at sxsw with the director in attendance quite a few people walked out and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end of the 60 or 70 films i ve seen at this festival frownland is among the worst at 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long you get to watch the main character s failed and drawn out attempts to communicate in extended real time the same grimaces hand over mouth motions kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again we get the point one site actually compares this work to early mike leigh what drugs would you have to be on to make that statement given that frownland is a captain beefheart song maybe you d have to be able to enjoy trout mask replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film unbelievably this won a jury award at the festival you can bet it did not win an audience award 
__label__0 first one was much better i had enjoyed it a lot this one has not even produced a smile the idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall but in reference to the characters not the film maker 
__label__0 this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining masterpiece jaws yes brainiac great whites and other species of shark bull black tip oceanic white tip tiger have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found humans don t often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior it s not like it s never happened the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town singling out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable much like this turd of a jaws knock off laughable great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below a shark the size of bruce if you don t know look it up would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orca hey that s the name of the blatant rip off we re discussing as it would weigh upwards of 6 000 lbs i could go on but i don t need to jaws is amazing better acting better effects better music better writing orca is crap blatant rip off of jaws lousy writing abominable effects most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick it doesn t take a masters from columbia university to see that watch better movies 
__label__1 i saw this movie back in 1984 we first started watching this is spinal tap and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep so we went instead to see this movie if you have any conspiracy theory s going around in your head you will want to watch this one the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this in my opinion there is no doubt that they could but i don t want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself but just to let you know we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do 
__label__1 petter mattei s love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler s play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter the acting is good under mr mattei s direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work 
__label__1 this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own the realism and subtle nuances offered to ashley judd s character ruby by the storyline capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida from the slam of a screen door to the lack of work the echoes of what life is really like on the red neck riviera provide rough choices for the young girl paradise did not come easy but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit and learns to be her own woman with a strength that flows from within ashley judd s winning smile and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration the careful pace of the character development resembles that of ulee s gold in 1997 starring peter fonda and also directed by victor nunez 
__label__1 this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds i ve already preordered them i suggest you do to 
__label__1 the odd couple is the classic film version of neil simon s most famous play about a tv newswriter named felix unger who is an obsessive neat freak who moves in with his divorced best friend oscar madison a sportswriter and complete slob after his wife frances throws him out of their apartment already divorced oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it neil simon s classic comedy first came to broadway with art carney playing felix and walter matthau playing oscar jack lemmon takes over for carney in the film version with a memorable performance as felix unger lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is felix unger matthau fortunately was allowed to recreate his role as oscar a one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout this teaming of lemmon and matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re visited in nine other films with both of these actors no longer with us the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious simon s play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed felix s suicide attempt that is a winner the supporting cast includes herb edelman john fiedler larry haines and david sheiner as oscar s poker playing buddies and moncia evans and carole shelley as the piedgon sisters blind dates of oscar and felix of course it later became an excellent tv series with tony randall and jack klugman but there s nothing like the original a joy from start to finish 
__label__0 model chris mccormack margaux hemingway is brutally raped by a teacher chris sarandon of her sister kathy mariel hemingway he is brought to trial but goes totally free he then rapes kathy objectionable and sick rape film this movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape what it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama it purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face to be totally honest however hemingway s acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had the trial scenes were boring and predictable and the movie just went too far when 15 year old mariel is raped thankfully that wasn t shown i do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when margaux grabs a gun and shoots sarandon dead but seriously having a young girl raped is just revolting acting doesn t help for instance margaux was no actress she was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model i believe but her acting left a lot to be desired it lessens the film mariel was just ok but this was one of her first films sarandon does what he can as the rapist he wasn t bad but the terrible script worked against him i do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people i found this boring simplistic and really sick a 1 all the way 
__label__0 this movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life besides farenheit 9 11 all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while 80 of the asssociated press highly criticize the science promoted be gore global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together this movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies liberal blindness an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage 
__label__1 after finally watching walt disney s song of the south on myspace i decided to watch ralph bakshi s response to that movie coonskin on afro video which i linked from google video in this one during the live action sequences preacherman charles gordone takes his friend sampson barry white with him to pick up pappy scatman crothers and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name professionally as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox gordone and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts there s a mix of animation and live action that provides a unique point of view from the writer director that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america who s a big as in gigantic in every way white blonde woman dressed in skin tight red white and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bear s frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me there s also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a cockroach she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jr s version of ain t no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n word in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation 
__label__0 john boorman s 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback though it s hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesn t get it instead it s lumbered with what may well be brendan gleeson s worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there s nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but it s at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics there s a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the general and his men painting them as anti social drug dealers purely because cahill won t share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we re expected to find lovably cheeky that it s just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then it s too late to really care adrian dunbar maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but jon voight s hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance overcompensating for gleeson s comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire come back zardoz all is forgiven 
__label__0 what a disappointment i hated the mummy but this one was even worse it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time i can t believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas cage wasn t very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america s most wanted buildings the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn t very convincing either i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment what a drag i guess i ve just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure 
__label__0 being a ni supporter it s hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists characters who are hard to root for typical heavy handed anti violence messages and a predictable poetic justice ending makes this an awkward watch 
__label__0 i have never seen the 1973 older highly rated version i am a nicholas cage fan by the way fine acting as usual this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot i can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party if you can t figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining this is of late the terrible rut that hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror mystery thriller genre unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh smart and tantalizing screenplay they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater at least it didn t have the jiggling hand held camera syndrome 
__label__1 this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survived i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that i ve seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herself this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesn t happen very often home room is a beautiful film and that s all there is too it 
__label__0 what a weekend two days ago i watched the first half of war games 2 dead code now while she was out i am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching i guess while she was out was worse it has all been said before in other comments unrealistic illogical etc the only thing i really have to add is that at some point i started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because i would have recommended her for a darwin award if she actually died only watched first half so i don t know soon i was at two darwin awards if that s even possible for her immense stupidity and hey produced by kim basinger so she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us the people i consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent which are idiots a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are 
__label__1 i ll be quick to address the matters of the film here it was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all consuming passions a young italian woman who cannot emotionally connect with her jailed political radical fiancé due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life finds solace and passion in a new young lover whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship with the anxieties rage tenderness and passions that swirl around in the atmosphere of the story equal the dispassionate quiet that seems to engulf the two leads it lends the film an unsettling mood that permeates through all the political strife that is otherwise lost on the viewer unless you have a deep knowledge of italian politics during the 80 s i found the film compelling what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead it isn t simulated and leaves little to the imagination there are other scenes of sex in the film which i do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in but the oral sex scene i feel derails the focus on the actual story it was smooth sailing up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears which caused much hoopla back in its day it s like hitting a roadblock it s jarring and unnecessary and i am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it and what s unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film which i believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface emotions and further turmoils layered in the subtext overall wonderful film hampered by a much not needed sex scene 
__label__0 let me start by saying that i d read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect still i was surprised by just how bad it was i am a big werewolf fan and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one most of them have sub par effects poor acting and weak storylines at best rehashed from earlier films so far with the possible exception of some of the later howling series films this is the worst of the lot first the story it s been quoted several times in reviews on this site so i won t go into specifics however it is very obvious that the writer s had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves above such fare they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos that s fine but a non horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted tv news footage for example never pans away from the reporter to close up on someone in the crowd behind them give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign and that s just the tip of the iceberg as for effects i have never seen a less believable werewolf i d have been happier with lon chaney jr in crepe hair the beast they used look a great deal like well like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics and i know that many people have already criticized the cg but my god it was awful one scene features a woman changing and starts with a completely cg version of the actress nude but for some reason without nipples my first thought was hey why is one of the characters from reboot turning into a silly looking werewolf anyway i like to look for positives in any film and there were a few the cinematography was passable the film was shot all digital which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the world s most well made up homeless woman and kane hodder as the title bad guy also the yellow power ranger got all growed up and well damn and if you re looking for skin there s some pretty tasty examples this ends the male pig segment of the review overall if you want a good werewolf film try an american werewolf in london the original the howling dog soldiers or even the wolfen though that one s got more wolf than were if you re a lycanthrope completest then take a gander otherwise give this one a miss 
__label__1 i have seen the perfect son about three times i fail to see how this film is a gay film i am not even gay but i don t see it as a gay film it is a film with a gay character i can t see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your kin i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ryan states that he doesn t want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone isn t that horrific and sad i highly recommend the film 
__label__1 well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked marie forsa as the busty helga is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn t one wishes they made more movies like this one 
__label__0 corridors of time the movie you can watch if you re looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a 2 10 but that s only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think i m gonna dislike him 
__label__1 what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that while perhaps lacking in substance still provides great entertainment throughout it s running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction rounders and roadkill i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i ve already seen from the director it would be well worth watching and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of the plot focuses on the overly moral michael a man travelling across america looking for work he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county only catch is that the job is to murder a man s wife he s been mistaken for a killer named lyle but instead of doing the job he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway however his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road he did it three years earlier with kill me again and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill it s not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one dahl also provides his film with a film noir like atmosphere as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters the acting is largely very good with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role and getting a class support from lara flynn boyle j t walsh and of course dennis hopper who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance it has to be said that the second half of the film isn t as gripping as the first but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it overall red rock west is a film that you re unlikely to regret watching it s thrilling throughout and you can t ask for much more than that 
__label__1 i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable well i paid to see it in a theatre and i m glad i did because visually it was a striking film most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s except for the shrink s office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the neve campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed out early 60s ambience and the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating for a first time director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked plausibility so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride in terms of acting and the depiction of father son mother son husband wife parent child relationships the film was spot on william h macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late tony perkins if this and magnolia are any indication tracey ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving to me it was a three dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two dimensional of course donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals the depiction of the parents bain sutherland reminded me in an indirect way of vincent gallo s buffalo 66 although toned down quite a bit i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director he has the self discipline of a 50s b crimefilm director something p t anderson will never have yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention 
__label__0 it s been a while since seeing this the first time so i watched it again with the second movie in the series while i realize there is a 3rd movie out that i haven t seen yet i ll review under the original title just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well what can you expect from a low budget b movie not much and it works from the standpoint of production however the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character development exactly what i d expect when there is an agenda to a film i didn t have a problem with the acting the cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves because the film is christian this is predictable as you can t very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with christianity in other words the mistake comes in making this into a g rated film when the content even in the most conservative of bible interpretations would be r rated by any measure so if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right however you can t comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books there are certainly plenty of christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies but not the left behind series and these movies ultimately fail because while being best sellers they are poorly written novels based on bad theology as a southern baptist minister i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series i have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times then i could live with that however this series is divisive in christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all scripture above a more proper hermeneutic inevitably this leads to the pre trib pre millenial dispensation point of view which confines an all powerful god far too by humanity s world in other words as i ve always said god shouldn t need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work but because many people particularly unstudied christians can t think beyond their own world views we are left with a pro conservative fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible i recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind because of his non adherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldn t possibly hold to another eschatology this is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in scripture and it s connection to real end time prophecy is tenuous at best but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the christian community and how they portray true christian behavior ultimately i feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith religion instead of win people towards it it turns all christians into caricatures equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice as a christian body on the whole we ve done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history and we certainly don t need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of others thus the left behind movies fail because the left behind books aren t worthy to be interpreted into movies 
__label__0 i bet you gene simmons and vincent pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in isn t just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword and big pussy what the hell was that look at me i m a rat double episode crap all that cliché mafia banter come on the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit hmm this is not reality but staged drama mark burnett s other show survivor also raised questions for me when johnny fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born yuk 
__label__0 boring and appallingly acted summer pheonix she sounded more asian than jewish some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century what on earth fine actors like ian holm anton lesser were doing in this is beyond me 
__label__0 i gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity my intention is not to burst anyone s bubble because i ve seen as i ve skimmed through other comments that this movie is quite appreciated by many well it is not worth any praises and i say this because i ve seen the original anime basilisk and this movie shames it deeply perhaps if you see shinobi alone you could like it it is enjoyable due to the well choreographed battles based on fantasy more than on martial arts and i agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced but the story is nothing like the original one now i understand that when one transforms an anime manga into a movie one must make certain changes i was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime although they have a well established role and some are truly profound and well designed but i certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly placed changes that basically ruin the entire story characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated transformed in something the public might love more perhaps for instance oboro who in the anime is a sweet innocent girl completely and utterly in love with gennosuke becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie i liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era we are talking about japan 17th century but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written hotarubi which is one of my favourite characters in the film but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime but is more or less worthless in the plot i could go on and on like how they made tenzen the worst and most dangerous character in the anime exceptionally weak and unattractive or how gennosuke the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused not to mention again weak the music is beautiful and the image is astounding which was expected of a japanese movie and i appreciate it for that but do not watch this if you ve seen and enjoyed basilisk because it is just hopeless basilisk although based on fantasy with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters storyline historical value and it is may i say heartbreaking shinobi was a waste of time and i could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax alas it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly but i advise you against it please watch the anime or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what basilisk really is by watching the anime otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they ve massacred it 
__label__1 i was pleasantly surprised by the film let s face it the premise doesn t sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the night s flick but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over there were no moments that i found uproarious and i doubt any that i ll remember the next day but this doesn t fail as a nice diversion what i found funny was watching it here in peking with my chinese girlfriend who never understands anything i like i told her there was a plot three guys have to bring back some weed to london hardly satisfying for her there is no mugging going on here for the camera which i d been expecting after reading a number of the comments i do take exception however to comparisons with withnail and i not in the same league and i doubt was it intended to www imperialflags blogspot com
__label__1 only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie superior ancients that dwell in the lands of lore far beyond any average human creature s understanding this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical force of fantasy unto thee mystical crystals of chalice stories come and go but the idea for a good story is to think positive not negative thoughts to create a good versus evil battle like never before embracing an impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other striking a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world 
__label__1 one of the comedies of the 1970 s also has the best signature tune of any comedy show the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing a man and two women richard o sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard s frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970 s but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements 
__label__1  the sentinel is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie s industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living i personally find the sentinel a very creepy movie and along with the exorcist they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alison s house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze it s also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world 
__label__1 greetings again from the darkness how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain adam sandler stars as charlie a man who lost his family in the 9 11 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity don cheadle co stars as sandler s former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life that sandler apparently had prior to 9 11 of course the parallels in these men s lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see men s feelings on display in a movie feelings other than lust and revenge that is watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt writer director mike binder the upside of anger and sandler s accountant in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film some of the scenes don t work as well as others but overall it is well written and solidly directed sandler and cheadle are both excellent sandler s character reminds a bit of his fine performance in punch drunk love but here he brings much more depth cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith as cheadle s wife liv tyler as a very patient psychiatrist saffron burrows in an oddly appealing role donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler s in laws the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde bruce springsteen and roger daltrey as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey not exactly a chipper upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story 
__label__1 first off let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny it was not degrading in any way every actor and actress did a superb job i laughed very hard at the sexual humor overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10 go find it and watch it 
__label__0 i don t get this the movie obviously has a pretty good budget it has very good cinematography it has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too then why oh why didn t they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that can t act their way out of a paper bag this movie could have been good at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at all so i would say it s a good production but a bad movie too bad actually and eels come one really 
__label__1 a mess of genres but it s mainly based on stephen chow s genre mash ups for it s inspiration there s magic kung fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it s easy to get past the many flaws in this film a baby is abandoned next to a basketball court a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery that s in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can t read the old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks the new master gets mad at the now 20 year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master s weak punches and throws him out for the night the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster s club to play darts this leads to a big fight the boy s expulsion from the monastery and the man s decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie the man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film i m sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end the effects photography and stunt work are all top notch and make up for the uninspired plot stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that s not a good reason to ignore it it s quite entertaining even with a scatter shot ending recommended 
__label__1 to like this movie at most you must be a strongly in love without a marriage b acknowledge english humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c be fairly very intelligent because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie and only if you meet b and c requirements you can recognize and enjoy author s input d to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like kirsted dunst who is so natural sweet and irresistible e you must admire creative a little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalitiesif you meet all these requirements you ll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points i never laughed half as much as from watching this masterpiece and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments i always get sensitive whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst

__label__0 not a movie but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the british invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the beatles to the music world some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond but a lot of them did featured are herman s hermits billy j kramer and the dakotas peter and gordon honeycombs nashville teens animals and of course the beatles it is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts 
__label__1 sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracy s greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them both tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest he s learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone has wounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry tracy s brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills he s learned to the gangster trade he s a hit man now and george doesn t really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest out the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i can t believe gladys george couldn t figure it out she s a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagney speaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogart s character development there is similar to tone s although he was not the central character of the movie in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwood s classic the unforgiven the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think it s a lot better than he gave it credit 
__label__0 i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasn t a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i haven t seen films subjecting gay porn don t keep your expectations high though then you will be very disappointed out of 
__label__1 this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick disorder in the court this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy the boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of voices of spring she is going to be offered a record deal but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer when she and the others leave the studio the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine the contract lady who can make christine s career sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd so he ll find a way to get back at them what a great stooge flick this should not be missed 10 10
__label__0 i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve the martial arts would look realistic eventually the special fx would actually look special i was so wrong i love horror i am a complete gore hound i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world this however was not made in the eighties if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad it wasn t so it hasn t got that defence the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture i don t like hostel never have i thought it was over rated over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming i m still waiting for the twist that was promised 
__label__1 sort of like a very primitive episode of general hospital set in a natal ward and one for tough cases at that this fast moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact mainly because eric linden as the distraught young husband in the main plot is so palpably a wreck and with such good reason his expectant wife loretta young is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20 year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him ms young as always doesn t do anything to disinvite audience sympathy and she s a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie and the outcome not an entirely happy one feels right aline macmahon one of the cinema s few perfect actresses in the apt words of film historian david thomson exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse and glenda farrell as a none too willing new mom of twins gets to croon frankie and johnny as a drunken lullaby frank mchugh figures in another subplot and he gets to show more range than warners usually permitted him it s scaled and paced modestly and linden s expectant dad panic stays with you for days this sort of part was often played for laughs but he s a terrified young kid in trouble and very persuasive

__label__0 since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequel the little mermaid one is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a child s self perspective the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the ending feels like recess the little mermaid 2 starts out when baby melody is presented to ariel s side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute it s not funny the baby s being attacked okay i ll stop laughing morgana s crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly throughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in melody s character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her face like the first movie melody has a lot of ariel s problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parent the music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much orchestral work went into it it s great for little ones because it doesn t take an orchestra to impress them the ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water it s definitely more targeted at kids because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking it s time for recess ultimately this movie is fun for kids so we should let them have fun 
__label__0 i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on this has to be the worst piece of monkey s t i have ever seen i ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but i got bored and turned it off let s see the wardrobe consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot the masks were made from what looks like tin foil the gore the gore was pretty good i must give it that but ittenbach s burning moon was better for a low budget movie acting was horrible i didn t mind the dubbing i find this humorous like in ittenbach s premutos great movie the fighting and action sequences were pi poor bottom line don t watch any of schnaas s movies there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter check premutos house of blood schramm and the nekromantiks 
__label__1 this was the first televised episode of the columbo series although it was filmed after death lends a hand and it heralded one of the most successful tv series in history jack cassidy who played the murderer in the series three times enthuses smugness arrogance and self assuredness in equal measure here as ken franklin one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner jim ferris played by martin milner who decides to terminate their professional relationship leaving franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer the initial murder set up is fantastic and cassidy s performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best columbo murderer in the series peter falk is wonderfully understated in his role as columbo and the character s inherent traits and oddities which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent mindedness contrast particularly well with cassidy s character s extreme smugness one of their early scenes together where ken franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through jim ferris s non existent expo see of identifying hit men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well franklin hints to columbo this potential motive and columbo purposely or ignorantly fails to latch on forcing franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books mrs melville also noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old steven spielberg notwithstanding some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode one particularly stark image is of jim feriss s dead body lying on the settee almost dark in the foreground as ken franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to ferris s distraught wife i have no doubt that working to a restrictive 10 14 day schedule spieberg s efforts should not be underestimated unfortunately the event of the second murder necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of franklin s and ironically referred to as sloppy by columbo in his climatic summing up takes the steam out of the whole thing the cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen time between falk and cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script writer stephen bocho out of a tight corner since he cannot singularly develop the story without another murder the climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode the initial banter and exchange of words between falk and cassidy is strongly and effectively executed but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode the main aggravation lies with the sealing clue if it can be called a clue cassidy s character s hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt and once this is mentioned he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion all in all a bold opening to the series which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about columbo and conversely the problems associated with such ingenuity i e maintaining the high standards and particularly creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending 
__label__0 having loved paris je t aime i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons although i was not expecting a re make of paris in new york i was expecting the same structure what i liked about paris was the breakup of the neighborhoods you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell in ny there is no clear separation of the stories at different points in the film characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow another thing i loved about the paris film was the different takes on love it wasn t all romantic there was love between parents and their children unrequited love a lonely middle aged woman yearning for love etc it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans ny seemed to only go for an edgy over the top sexuality there were some redeemable shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together julie christie s short but overall the ny film didn t evoke any emotion for me i didn t connect with any of the characters like i did with paris i remember watching paris and feeling a deep sadness loneliness yearning hopefulness wonder it just had so much soul for me there was no soul in the ny film maybe if i had gone into it without having paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response but as a self titled re take of paris je t aime i was sorely disappointed 
__label__1 both visually and musically stunning a treat for both the eye and the ear the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been justifiably proud technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting the dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing 
__label__1  a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy chamberland who in 1980 witnessed a horrific sight seeing her 3 month old baby being brutally taken from their family s tent while camping on the austrailian outback azaria the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired 
__label__0 i liked it i really did please don t think that i m an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film i expected it to be crap it was crap but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you don t have to concentrate too much on isn t it i didn t expect any hidden meanings or morales and there wasn t any but that doesn t matter because i only watched it for entertainment and it did entertain me throughout films like this are why the ben stillers excusing there s something about mary and the vince vaughns however you spell his last name i couldn t be bothered checking have jobs it s ok to watch a crap film as long as you don t expect too much from it and i for one shall take a stand jog perhaps run but not drive because i don t have a car to blockbuster video or even choices and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them good day to you reader p s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i don t like you if you do say it helped then god bless you you will go to heaven 
__label__1 maybe it wasn t that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so memorable i still remember it today i became a fan of dick francis i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries the cockney slang of the sidekick chico barnes is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing london s bow bells but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting sid halley was one of francis more interesting characters and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand interestingly electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after world war ii 
__label__1 a masterpiece thus it is possibly not for everyone the camera work acting directing and everything else is unique original superb in every way and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting summer phoenix creates a deep believable and intriguing esther kahn as everything else in this film her acting is unique it is completely her own neither british nor american nor anything else i have ever seen there is something mesmerizing about it the lengthy unbroken natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing 
__label__0 this movie proves that you can t judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it or get it for someone at christmas the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising well until you meet the characters pumpkin jack the old guy from down the street brings the college co eds a book full of witch s spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house where the movie takes place after that there is some drinking fighting and soft core porn then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour overall hallow s end was predictable unsuspensful and reminiscent of a soft core porn this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do as it is a good movie to make fun of and for first time viewers it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die 
__label__1 i really thought that this movie was superb not only is the history correct but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate i was a fan of emily blunt s portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous perhaps infamous for the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well i appreciated the beautiful score which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009 s best 
__label__1 this show probably won t appeal to everyone sarah does what she wants she doesn t ask for permission and she doesn t apologize this is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of wallet stealing male cheerleaders the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled bigoted pervert if you can t appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isn t for you everyone should at least give this show a chance it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman brian posehn the comedians of comedy jay johnston mr show steve agee bobcat goldthwait s stay and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon heat vision jack monster house it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community channel101 com if you re into this show keep an eye out for the department of acceptable media on vh1 this march it ll be drawing from the same talent pool watch sarah silverman s show this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment 
__label__1 on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand café in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience la sortie des usines lumière was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience we start with closed doors of the lumière factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close again whether this is the first film or not some say l arrivée d un train à la ciotat was the first film lumière recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don t get to see historical things like this every day 
__label__1 gentleman jim not really a boxing film it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett but having said that the boxing scenes are a real eye opener to the modern viewer there are no 12 round points decisions here errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett his opponent john sullivan is still better however a bruiser of the old school played by ward bond the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment he is a liar and an egotist sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all and errol flynn gets the girl 
__label__1  all the world s a stage and its people actors in it or something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit or even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itself this film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said 
__label__0 i would just like it to be known that i do not often rate movies below a 5 i was originally very excited to see this movie its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie so the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film the storyline seemed intriguing enough some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway there s a photographer obsessed with the missing people where are they going what s happening to them one day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around yada yada the film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly predictable oh no it s dark look out behind you i say quite bored with the cheap thrills the plot even though predictable was intriguing that is until the end this was good until the end then it just got silly says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards and i fully agree and here come the spoilers see i was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism no it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries woo how original how unrealistic how dull 3 10 come on lionsgate you ve had amazing films but this one sunk 
__label__1 this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal it has this hazy overtone that is rarely captured on film it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future very natural acting for such young ones i don t know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good but no the less excellent bill scored as far as i m concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr paxtons bad acting what can one do in that role he played the part rather well in my opinion this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good the ethan hawke version wow do not listen to his comments great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable if that s what you want cinematography gets an above the average rating also 
__label__1 those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film s pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back story could have come off the back of a count chocula box the empty acre is the movie for you set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six month old baby as the couple s weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever there the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer director s faith in an intellectual audience there seems to be a sub text concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically astute the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love 
__label__0 body slam 1987 is a flat out terrible movie the low budget reeks the direction is pedestrian at best and the writing and acting is lame but if you re into old school wrestling circa 1970 s through the mid 80 then you ll be more entertained than the average viewer i have to warn you this movie stinks on ice i gave it a two because i felt like being generous this turkey was directed by stunt master hal needham the stars are roddy piper the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c list actors dirk benedict the synopsis of this movie is about a promoter who wants to combine hair rock and wrestling but their are others that don t want him to succeed there s more but i don t want to spoil it for you if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline there s a few surprises near the end for die hard wrestling fans i wouldn t recommend this to my worse enemy and i mean it 
__label__0 a very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it s creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie personally i can t do that with a drama and found this too far fetched i m particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete imbecile in this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no movie the first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named magruder played by kenneth branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl mallory doss played by embeth davidtz who is screaming that her car has been stolen they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town they notice that her car is in the driveway also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken things are very odd she s weird looking like a tramp she undresses in front of him until she s completely naked oh yeah also the father s strange the house is a wreck everything should have told magruder hey this is too weird for me i m out of here but not magruder he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed it all screams set up then being the top flight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16 year old magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is terrorising them the police ignore him i could have believed begrudging assistance but no help at all not likely it s just too unlikely 
__label__1 one of john s funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd and extras would be great the kung fu uuniversity kung fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of it s hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ebay is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them 
__label__1 one of the great mysteries of life suffered from daily is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys worse when the nice guys even want to marry those girls the girls still prefer the jerks and heels even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt have shown they re just interested in using the girls stu erwin is the nice guy who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely clark gable is the jerk and he is perfect in the role rather a sad note to his fans jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters intended to be bad guys i mean heck they re locked up so they must be are so obviously nice people in fact there are lots of nice people here people who in a lesser film or story would be snarling and back stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else so maybe the story is rather clichéd at least by modern standards but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit once again we can say a fervent thank you to imdb com 
__label__0 this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot not at all scary 
__label__1 watching ossessione today more than 6 decades later is still a powerful experience especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever roughly from ossessione and de sica s i bambini ci guardano both 1943 up to 20 years later with fellini antonioni pasolini visconti makes an amazing directing début taking the uncredited plot of the postman always rings twice as a guide to the development of his own themes it strikes us even today how ahead of its time ossessione was shot in fascist italy during world war ii think about it it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn t help ossessione alarmingly reveals poverty ridden war time italy far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist telefoni bianchi movies but it s also extremely daring in its sexual frankness with shirtless hunk gino massimo girotti who definitely precedes brando s kowalski in a streetcar named desire taking giovanna clara calamai a married woman to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet we watch calamai s unglamorous matter of fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo a very appealing actor his face not unlike pierre clémenti s who was shot by the nazis in 1945 at 28 years old in a few words sex lust greed and poverty as relentlessly as it had rarely if ever been shown before in italian cinema all the copies of ossessione were destroyed soon after its opening it was called scandalous and immoral visconti managed to save a print and when the film was re released after the war most critics called it the front runner of the neo realist movement preceding rossellini s roma città aperta and de sica s sciuscià some other critics perhaps more appropriately saw ossessione as the italian counterpart to the poetic realism of french cinema remember visconti had been renoir s assistant especially marcel carné s quai des brumes and le jour se lève and julien duvivier s pépé le moko while ossessione may be neo realistic in its visual language the depiction of war time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs poverty child labor prostitution bums swindlers etc the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian he was always more interested in tragic passionate obsessive greedy characters in social political sexual apartheid in the decadence of the elites than in realistic everyday life characters and themes favored by desica and rossellini in ossessione we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films especially senso visconti s definitive departure from neo realist aesthetics and rocco e suoi fratelli even in his most neo realist film la terra trema he makes his fishermen rise from day to day characters to mythological figures ossessione is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again from their first to their last opus no matter if the scenery background or time setting may change visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are well obsessively recurrent ossessione is not to be missed you ll surely be fascinated by this ground breaking powerful film 
__label__0 woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court okay that sounds all right there it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film this movie became redundant retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by woody harrelson played one of my favorite t v characters woody from cheers and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie but after seeing his acting performance i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend his acting was as dull and poor as the movie another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez i have liked movies with perez before but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn t have that many speaking lines do the right thing but now in white men can t jump she was made a central character with many lines thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice so after seeing this film term used loosely and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i m a white man and i m getting ready to jump off a twenty story apartment building 
__label__0 wha bam someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acid mushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture writer howard cohen expands the sword sorcery concept with a couple of extra s s like sex silliness more sex and sheer stupidity this isn t just a movie this is every juvenile pervert s dreams fantasies come true deathstalker has it all blood violence trolls female mud wrestling attempted rape successful rape life sized pigs awful hairstyles hideously oiled muscular bodies multi sexual orgies gay warriors tournaments to the death delirious witches dismemberment laughable villains and boobs boobs booooooooobies deathstalker literally wipes the floor with its obvious role model conan the barbarian when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance the story is evidently of minor importance lone and gay only he doesn t know it yet warrior deathstalker goes on a mission as commanded by an annoying witch to gather the three notorious elements of creation or something like that on his journey he combines forces with a troll turned human a fighter who s even gayer than he is and last but not least a luscious lady who doesn t really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil munkar where they ll participate in a warriors tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements munkar is bald guy with half a spider s web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous okay granted deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie the fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make up effects are downright pitiable for a moment when beholding the opening sequence i actually feared i was watching troll the prequel the monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing but it s undeniable entertainment if you re in an undemanding mood i presume this isn t a favorite amongst feminists as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat um discriminating most of the gals exclusively serve as eye candy in the harem they re allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud but strictly forbidden to open their mouths the two leading ladies barbi benton and lana clarkson are ravishing but in all honesty if it wouldn t be for their continuously exposed racks they would hardly be worth mentioning either 
__label__1 a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas this film is hilarious admittedly you have to have a taste for films with screaming hysterical dialogue over the top acting and melodramatic plot twists but if you do you re in for one hell of a treat sally field plays celeste talbert daytime tv s queen of misery celeste s cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven elisabeth shue her long lost niece and simultaneously jeffrey anderson kevin kline splendid as always celeste s long ago lover but celeste has been hiding a deep dark secret and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface add in the diabolical montana moorehead a wonderful cathy moriarty in full gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode who is trying mighty hard to destroy celeste s career david robert downey jr the weenie boy producer of the soap who s secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste and rose schwarz whoopi goldberg scriptwriter and celeste s one true confidant and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute does anyone remember mixed nuts but when done well can be pretty damn funny a major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look field kline goldberg and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm shue is clearly the weakest link here but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field kline et al moriarty is a stand out in the showy villainess role making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see there are also lots of familiar faces that you ll recognize in small but nevertheless all very funny roles including carrie fisher garry marshall kathy najimy and teri hatcher director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish mention must also be made of robert harling s screenplay carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera the dialogue is boiling over with great lines delivered brilliantly by the actors i d be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised look if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it get your hands on this one if not for anything else it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh 
__label__1 tripping over i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and abe forsythe s unquestionable talent i continued to watch i can safely say i m now glad that i did the story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most don t have any information missing the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line here s to hoping for another season 
__label__0 i couldn t make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews the opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story in it a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend he is assigned to photograph a mountain range it s rumored to be haunted but i couldn t tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film on his way he meets a beautiful writer patty shepard and convinces her to join him on his working trip throughout the film there is this terrible music score mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream shut up already what really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it s about to become good though it never does there is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere the inn and the silent abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous the foggy nights look real not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set and the idea while not original had potential but it never does improve at least not enough to be worthwhile here s how it goes more or less they stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper you expect him to be named igor with a hearing problem there is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window but the scene is so dark i had no idea what was going on whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me in any event we never find out know what happened there is a scene where she wanders off during the night whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen then found again with nothing stolen they wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman there are other things including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them the witches themselves a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don t show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained even the closing scene doesn t make any sense when all is said and done most people will be saying huh 
__label__0 this is not so much film as big budget children s television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when it s first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man s long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that s not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive 
__label__1 he s stocky sweaty slightly cross eyed and restless he stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert he claims that we the film viewers perceive the screen as a toilet bowl and are all secretly wishing for all the s t to explode from the inside he s unpredictable and scary well come on you could have guessed by now he s one of the leading philosophers of our age slavoj i ek is both a narrator and a subject of sophie fiennes extraordinary new film a pervert s guide to the cinema fiennes illustrates a feature long lecture by i ek and does so in two ways by providing exemplary film clips and putting i ek on real or reconstructed locations from the movies he speaks about it s always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies although revenge of the sith got here as well but the main attraction of a pervert s guide is i ek himself what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again what is more outrageous i ek s views or i ek s screen presence in a documentary by astra taylor i ek 05 slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent because he claimed he feels like he doesn t exist in the first place the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly and talk he did and how also a pervert s guide is dominated by his voice delivering perfect english in most crazy way and making some astonishing points about the cinema what are those well for example he sees chaplin s reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself kind of alien force taking over the human being think the ventriloquist segment of dead of night 45 he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects not to provide us with them he identifies groucho marx as super ego chico as ego and harpo as id he says a million other interesting things and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him so persuasive and captivating are his looks at some point i couldn t help but stare at his thick scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath craving of course for more insights most notable are i ek s readings of lynch and hitchcock which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them the cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of i ek s lecture memorable and unlike others difficult to argue with since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors this doesn t go for his reading of tarkovsky for example upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality dismissing precisely what s so remarkable in all tarkovsky namely strong religious intuitions and images the question isn t whether i ek is inspiring and brilliant because he is or whether fiennes film is worth watching because it is likewise the real question is rather are i ek views coherent one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride but after the whole thing is over some doubts remain for example while considering vertigo 58 i ek states that what s hidden behind human face is a perfect void which makes face itself only a facade something of a deception in its own means however when in the final sequence we hear about the ever shattering finale of city lights 31 as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another it s hard not to ask what happened to the whole facade thing why should we grant chaplin s face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive kim novak s of this same privilege in two bold strokes or maybe that incoherence might also be read in lacan s terms the name of the notoriously unreadable french psychoanalyst is fundamental to i ek s thought the film has all the virtues of a splendid two and a half hours lecture lots of ground are covered many perspectives employed even some first rate wisecracks made when i ek travels on a melanie daniels boat from the birds 63 and tries to think as she did he comes up with i want to f k mitch but it has also one shortcoming that isn t inherent to two and a half hours lecture as such it s almost obsessively digressive i ek s yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of i ek s perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on changing subjects constantly overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant cool fizzing wave you re simultaneously taken by surprise refreshed in mortal danger and confused no end as you finish watching your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and you re already planning on re watching some films but you also share a sense of having survived a calamity the ultimate question is did i ek lost it or haven t we even came close to the real thing once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other not having any movies around to turn our faces to i dare you all who will have enough guts to approach i ek and defy him my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life you become a believer 
__label__1 since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro goldwyn mayer had mario lanza under contract no one else could have done it i doubt whether it will ever be tried again and why should it i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen for his tenor voice was his life his reason for being on the earth to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest caruso like the man who portrayed him was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought he s shown in a recording studio once late in his life actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men it s why both became the legends that they are what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn t get an actual cast album with ann blyth dorothy kirsten and jarmila novotna also though blyth sang it in the film lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso if you re looking for a life of enrico caruso this ain t it if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career than you should not miss the great caruso 
__label__1 there are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this movie s details far more eloquently than i could but i would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment raising victor vargas is so true you will believe it this flick gets inside your head 
__label__1 this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today s politically minded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the 1960 s can t be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film s breezy energy and charm i don t know what those who label the film boring were watching there s so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time 
__label__1 having read diamond s book i was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative reading the other comments it is comforting to know that the culture warriors are hard at work seeing attacks on western civilization under every rug is diamond a little preachy sure like a lot of academics he sees his theory as the most important thing ever he uses the phrase guns germs and steel at seemingly every opportunity during the series we get it after about the first 10 minutes is diamond a little simplistic in the series sure the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing condensing some very long complicated history down to smallpox swords and horses wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes but the point remains valid these things did in fact contribute but not totally define the reasons for the spaniard s success against the established cultures is he preaching against western civilization in any way nope not a word not to my ear all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly not that luck is the only reason in the end if you re looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority then this series is not for you but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence 
__label__1 made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ship s entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas 1935 as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won t describe the way max rises to the occasion sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock s the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching 
__label__0 i understand the jokes quite well they just aren t good the show is horrible i understand it and that s another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it s not funny not funny i don t want people to say only smart people get it because if they re so smart why do they judge people they don t even know and say that they re not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it s like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they re just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i m not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they don t even know anything about any of us isn t exactly a smart comment 
__label__1 family is about two families who are after each other s blood viren sahay amitabh bachchan is an underworld don operates from bangkok he has a family in india once by mistake he kills shekhar akshay kumar like viren sahay he also has a family a brother wife and parents aryan aryaman shekhar s brother is out to take revenge of his brother s death he kidnaps viren sahay s family for the same reason the film has got one turning point amitabh bachchan second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs expression matters more akshay s minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh i didn t understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie there were a few loose points in the script like amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot free in the city kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague how can the family of such a big don doesn t have any security cover 
__label__0 pet sematary though a nice 80 s horror movie with a nice director and atmosphere is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati it s clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director the movie zeder was made before king wrote the book the cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being stephen kind a famous american writer it s totally normal that he can get away with this it s obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no budget and in part it s crap itself but the original idea i repeat it it s italian director avatilet the world know
__label__1 ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn t let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isn t really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummy one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother s secret is pretty frightening okay the acting in the film isn t all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr flocker you ve done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one 
__label__0 when i heard that the dukes of hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script i was like alright i ll give it a chance it s not going to be better than the first but we ll see what happens well i saw what happened i saw a great late 70 s 80 s show that was a classic basically humiliated by hollywood it s so sad to see that hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days they are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience and try to remake the classic show heads up hollywood it ain t workin anyway more about the show i think they could have casted a better actor than sean william scott stiffler from american pie to play bo i m sure that john schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of also get for real johnny knoxville as luke duke how low can you go a crappy jackass actor to play lovable luke this sickens me also i ll give jessica simpson is a beautiful woman but her acting sucks catherine bach who played the original daisy was smart sexy strong opinionated and a good il southern girl she was every little girls role model growing up i owned the doll and the jeep thank you very much anyway jessica simpson played a smart ass 2 bit slut as daisy duke daisy never was blonde why did they have to cast her jessica alba would have played a great daisy duke she can speak with a great southern accent and she is gorgeous and would have done a wonderful job anyway i d like to say that this movie blew something fierce i feel like i got ripped off by paying 8 50 for tickets and they should refund my money if you like the dukes of hazzard the original series don t see this movie it ll just upset you cmt country music television plays the reruns of the dukes all the time later at night so set your tivo s and go with the real thing not the imitation on the big screen in hollywood 
__label__0 watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another darryl f zanuck should have known better betty plays a 19th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks jr her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment before things have been consummated that s going to give anyone a bad attitude i guarantee fresh wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious marlene dietrich might have put this over but with betty it falls flatter than yesterday s presidential candidate she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song that lady in ermine s one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bows ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine i can t believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here neither will you if you see that lady in ermine 
__label__0 well where to start here straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma had this film come out of italy in say 1975 been directed by ruggero deodatto and starred david hess then i d be lapping it up faster than labrador drinks water on a summer s day because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema dan reed has produced a rape revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in england and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose mcgowan s leg into a machine gun because if you want to play grindhouse bingo then let me call out the numbers 1 rich high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and equally implausibly gets the hots for him check 2 gratuitous shots of said high flying career woman in various states of nudity check 3 convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in check 4 unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape check 5 gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off bingo plotwise straightheads is pretty basic stuff dyer meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss on the way home they upset three locals in a landover who take their revenge by giving dyer a good shoeing and gang raping anderson the couple then set about getting their revenge so far so straw dogs late night trains house on the edge of the park i spit on your grave etc etc so why didn t i think much of this film a number of reasons i suppose first off having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better but it s the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most because whenever anyone sits down to watch hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70 s then they always know exactly what they are getting low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator the baddies terrorise and murder the goodies the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back and everyone goes home satisfied their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored as writer and director however dan reed clearly believes straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there for instance when anderson and dyer are planning revenge on their attackers they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen year old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with when anderson finally meets him face to face he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter the casual and audacious way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw dropping it s almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience s moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they ve just sat through something of significance to make sure we get it at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter but reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of anderson rough handled and raped across the bonnet of her car gratuitous does not enter into it after being told his reasons for raping her anderson ties him over a table rams the business end of a sniper rifle complete with bulky silencer just in case anyone wasn t clear on the phallic imagery up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger telling dyer who has no such moral qualms that it s over dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that wittgenstein and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at cambridge over tea and cakes it is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness in fairness ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film it s obvious she wants to leave scully far behind and bless her she certainly does that one wonders what mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun dyer on the other hand does what he s done in virtually every film he s made to date that is plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching this is particularly true at the closing scene where after murdering his assailants in cold blood dyer gazes at the camera in what i m sure is meant to be a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after stan has landed him in yet another fine mess which incidentally sums up this film quite nicely 
__label__1 i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasn t even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfeld s acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don t take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if you re looking for a random movie and you like woody allen i d definitely recommend it 
__label__0 i recently watched this film at the 30 th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films i ve ever had the misfortune to watch don t get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films e g manos hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the 13 th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep 
__label__1 i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame boy was i wrong there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine even the acting was great jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was superb on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it it makes all the copycats e g nightmare on elm street scream look very tame i can t really say it is carpenter s best because i have not seen many of his the only one i can remember of his is starman i think he made it halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre 
__label__0 if utterly facile regressive self indulgent anti establishment anti civilisation juvenilia appeals to you then this is the ideal film very poorly scripted with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand held camera throughout this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic manichean terms all adults especially teachers parents priests and doctors are insensitive and bumbling at best and predatory monsters at worst the only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming yawn and infantile regression literally in a primitive cave like space in the woods with utopia taking the form of a rave party again in the woods naturally displays all the weaknesses of a first film and plenty more besides 
__label__1 i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs weren t great at least they weren t disney over produced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect walken s acting made it believable great fun i d watch it again with my daughter 
__label__0 why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime the texas chainsaw massacre the hills have eyes but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren t brilliant to start with prom night the amityville horror much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasons it s a poorly acted massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do it s clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually bloodless and i m not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm the original one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna keppel brittany snow has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style when the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and he ll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna who will survive to see graduation day and what will donna do when she s forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis co star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thing without much to work with mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump scare moment desperate times really do call for desperate measures there haven t been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue in the era of the hills my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society s creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that movie my final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night it s even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack job remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or frights a night you ll be in a hurry to forget 
__label__0 painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters two of the main characters cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable it wasn t worth the wait i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view 
__label__0 end of the world is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist i m not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that s the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly top secret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out they re on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space he s ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they re going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesn t help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi plus there s lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed 
__label__0 despite the english title this seems to have little to do with devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the philospher s stone wants gold made from lead virgin s blood jacinto molina plays gilles de lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood he s basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he s employed and it s more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession unfortunately there are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks and the film at least has a good look to it but otherwise there s little about this to recommend little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all and most unusual for a molina naschy film not really any unintentional humor therefore 4 out of 10 
__label__1  jag är nyfiken yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful self aware explorative don t expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid 60s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest social political documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians e g olaf palme at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena s life her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sjöman and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish i think sjöman may have had something similar in mind while jag är nyfiken yellow may not be everyone s cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic 
__label__0 when i went and saw this movie i had great expectations but i had so wrong this movie was exactly as every other horror movies it s a virus zombies etc exactly as resident evil and many many other movies but the difference with this and other movies is that the story is very week it s bad actors and boring music the photo is ok but the rest is total crap don t see this horror movie go and see the ring 2 or any other movie who s much more of a story i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies we have seen enough of that the only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous infected celebrities 
__label__1 sandra bernhard s without you i m nothing the movie released in 1990 followed on the heels of her 1988 off broadway stage production what she and others refer to in the movie as her smash hit one woman show there were several changes in monologues and one liners and the movie version visually re vamps the story taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york during what she calls her superstar summer to an illusory almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back to her roots to upscale supper clubs like the parisian room there s a point to be made here sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn t completely see it in l a she s playing to a predominantly black audience trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is shashonna a madonna look alike stripper and even then with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from like a virgin there s not much to be said for the audience s enjoyment of the show the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants but if she s going down sandra s doing so with style and force conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability right to the point at which she s naked literally pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein jerry lewis bianca jagger ralph lauren and what we re lead to believe is warren beatty are fictional and hilarious sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone s song four women while dressed in a mufti and other african garb singing lines such as my skin is black my hair is wooly and they call me sweet thing she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product that they ve been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him saying mister if this is about ishtar i m getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that s too self indulgent even for me sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism dressed as a cosmo girl sandra retells her young girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss she eventually concludes in relief i ll never be a statistic not me i m under 35 and i m going to be married sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society when he touches you in the night does it feel all right or does it feel real i say it feels real mighty real finally she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming eventually everyone will funk all this comes in the form of glitzy schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul burt bacharach hank williams and laura nyro to name a few at the same time the idealized fictional incarnation of sandra her self generated mirror image floats around town a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music in without you i m nothing sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that up until then she d only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman her almost child like enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the 80s is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing this approach to comedy would change sandra s direction forever and mark the more mature more personable entertainer to come if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour celebrity sex loneliness despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship this movie will keep you in stitches it may not be meant to be funny across the board perhaps it s a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you and you ll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is but see without you i m nothing with a friend in the know because it s definitely funnier that way before you know it the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else 
__label__0 assassin hauser s john cusak mission is to whack a mid eastern oil minister whose name happens to be omar sharif neikov in the country of turaqistan which is run by american interests hauser poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omar sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying here it does too much the government politics music war people not generally accepted by society and did i mention war and that is what we have here a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd also there are so many cusak family members in this that john cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there or is that just me it used to be that a john cusak movie while a little offbeat was in the end rather good not here believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess make of that what you will there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun fire bombings and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point probably it just takes too long to set up the hit which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast and chemistry between john cusak and marisa tormei i don t think so but you know the boy girl thing and they needed something to take up more time yes for what they were supposed to be offbeat and annoying the performances of duff and kingsley were good but when i saw dan aykroyd s character in the beginning of the show sitting on a toilet taking a dump i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well i was not wrong i am sure some will sing praises of this effort but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so too is a mess i now remember why i continued with the dvd i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself never did violence yes sex no nudity no language yes 
__label__0 this video nasty was initially banned in britain and allowed in last november without cuts it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979 ursula buchfellner the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures i am not sure what the purpose of that was it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene laura buchfellner is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom peter al cliver the beyond zombie is sent to find her and the ransom of course one of the kidnappers antonio de cabo manages to pass the time productively while another werner pochath whines incessantly the ransom exchange goes to hell and laura runs into the jungle will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal oh yes there are cannibals in this jungle why do you think it was a video nasty muriel montossé is found by peter and his partner antonio mayans angel of death on the kidnapper s boat montossé is very comfortably undressed peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura who has been captured by now they pass the time having sex and don t see the danger approaching guts anyone great fight between peter and the naked devil burt altman blood decapitation guts lots of full frontal some great writhing by the cannibal priestess aline mess and the line they tore her heart out which is hilarious if you see the film 
__label__0 it was 1 a m in the morning and i had nothing else to do don t judge me please we re back in time during the spanish settlements a group have made their way onto an island it doesn t take too long before they encounter a large reptile which gobbles up their horse soon they re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the reptile gods the cg sucks it reminds me of the cg of early console video games the encounters were lame the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit otherwise it s just a middling effort 
__label__0 this movie has not aged well maybe it s just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that we ve seen with the sopranos but i just viewed prizzi s honor for the first time on dvd alone the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but i have to say i was just appalled at the ending not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending i enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character also when was this move supposed to be set the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the world trade center towers completed in 1973 were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person somehow mid 1980s audiences found this film charming and funny mid eighties meet the late oughts only of you can live 
__label__0 the minute the forward started i knew we were in for trouble the premise is laughable at best the story line was even worse if that is possible the acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience you expect more from the likes of slater reid and dorff lines were delivered as if from a robot and i m sorry i like reid but she was very unbelievable as an archaeologist slater and dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks the continuity was off through out the entire film the creatures weren t bad but they really weren t good either bottom line i want that ninety minutes of my life back they can keep the money but give me the time what a waste 
__label__0 a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine and here susan lucci performs as a siren although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one isabelle lucci inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins john o hurley begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart in the wake of the hit man s assault upon collins a pair of police detectives performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott become increasingly curious concerning isabelle s possible involvement in the crime while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata s maneuvering lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds but o hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements released upon a fremantle dvd this largely lustreless affair depicting a man neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top flight visual and sound quality and although no extra features are provided the above average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards 
__label__1 textbook example of an underestimated movie although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it it s still regarded as just another funny picture and although the movie has inspired many and added it s quotes and images to the pyche of all it s viewers moon over parador still hasn t received the acclaim it should even the brilliant cast with academy award winner richard dreyfuss and raul julia to mention one is not able to change this perception but after watching raul julia as roberto strausmann make richard dreyfus an offer he can t refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion this stuff is timeless in fifty years we will have the proof 
__label__1 in it s time this movie had controversy written all over it like most of verhoeven s projects containing very graphic depictions death scenes a parachute that doesn t open smack guys body on the floor a guy being eaten by a lion chomp teeth in the throat and a guy being run over by a speedboat zoom bloody corpse going down but besides gore this flick also contains some brilliant and stunningly beautiful scenes filmed in the gray fisher s town that is vlissingen thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie a beautiful holy woman putting flowers in a milk can surrounded by slabs of blood dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters in a graveyard the story is concluded in a frantic but fulfilling 10 minutes that don t disappoint and will leave you sighing a breath of relief of course with the pros come the cons some special effects are too over the top and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gore factor e g the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets also while the two lead actors jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters the character of herman portrayed by the rather un charming thom hoffman just feels enormously underdeveloped making him hard to care for even after his tragic death i ve done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie and as you can see it s not easily summed up in words so do yourself a favor if you happen to find this movie somewhere watch it and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece 
__label__1 this animated movie is a masterpiece the narration music animation and storyline where all remarkable my girlfriend and i saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it we invited a couple friends to see spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot when i asked them to come along to see it they thought it was a movie about horses but afterwards they realized it was more than that i liked esperanza spirit rain and lil creek who reminds me of nathan chasing horse who is smiles a lot in dances with wolves spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that i found to be empowering and inspirational i saw spirit for a third time and i want to go see it again i enjoyed spirit tremendously because its portrayal of american indians is realistic dignified and non stereotypical unlike the movie the road to el dorado which was a total farce because it portrayed american indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way but dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making spirit a great movie that i found to be acceptable i hope they continue to make more animated movies like spirit and i would like to see sequels or spinoffs to spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping american indians i highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see spirit stallion of the cimarron 
__label__1 i watched this tape immediately rewound it watched it again and laughed twice as hard i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of but uncomfortable around transvestites it shows you that transvestitism is a feature rather than the entirety of one s being the comedy is not single issue this man is brilliant all comics should aspire to his level of candor intelligence and talent 
__label__1 it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like shô kasugi christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the perfect b adventure of all time it s actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it s flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if it s made in the 90s it doesn t have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just can t hate it i think it s an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song 
__label__1 after seeing this film months ago it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that point i fell in love with hal hartley s directing many years ago i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained it is a strange feeling granted and i assume most people out there really just don t get it or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable i guess i just really get it its as if these films were made for me although i don t remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film it remains one of the funniest films i ve seen in many years if you don t see the humor of the grocery bag fay carries from the street to a church to her brother s publisher s office to her son s principal s office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film the bag is a silent character in itself being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her i consider henry fool my least favorite of hartley s films i honestly don t remember it very well i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious hartley s forte seems to be feminine character development aside from posey s brilliance it was wonderful to see elina lowensohn one of my favorite actresses again her extravagant naiveté is perfect for hartley s direction his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout this film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story explaining political situations in afganistan this is never suspected at the beginning the complexity of this film s development is unparalleled this is the epitome of a stand alone sequel the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is spun around him the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film as an alcoholic chain smoking complaint machine hurling insults at his islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12 year old schoolyard bully although i was impressed and satisfied with hartley s other recent films the girl from monday and no such thing fay grim goes far beyond what i expected with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare 
__label__1 this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in proscenium and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the bathtub is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen be sure to wear your shower cap 
__label__1 cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget there are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience as he makes his exit he assures the client grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of 100 00 from the total or at least 50 00 but certainly 25 00 hilarious 
__label__0 a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lover s apartment rogers actually has two identities at the film s outset that of miss terry the dead victim s secretary along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand talbot instead of her paper s rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he s been out scooped here s a puzzle it s revealed during police inspector russell s purnell pratt investigation of harker s death that terry morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks why exactly was that after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before clues are dropped regarding harker s association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isn t relevant until it s all linked up to janitor peterson harvey clark and who s making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss with the words you will hear it cut and pasted beneath apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house s radiator system which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as mrs coby in the apartment below harker but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs coby s death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation it s these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the building s incinerator furnace however and score another point against continuity we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway but how and still pretty as a picture and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred arthur hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room sorry but for all those reviewers who found a shriek in the night to be a satisfying whodunit i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable the usual suspects by comparison if you need a reason to see the film it would be ginger rogers but be advised she doesn t dance 
__label__1 gere and danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders gere who plays babbage refers to them as his flock gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out he is training new comer allison to take over his job gere sees his flock as very sick disturbed puppies he asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve crimes he keeps getting warned for this behavior hence the reason he is being replaced during his final few days on the job a young girl goes missing and babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone awol so he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police that part is a little far fetched there is some sick twisted stuff shown in this film like when babbage and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other also there are the people who kidnapped the girl at the end of the film we see what sick freaks they are however i wouldn t call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film final verdict if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers then you will like this 
__label__1 this film is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish the ramones reigning princes of late 70s punk rock appear as themselves pj soles stars as riff randle the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock n roll riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones her favorite rock band she keeps the school rockin and encourages her fellow students to join her in her jubilant antics meanwhile the school that riff attends has just hired a brand new principal named ms togar she s a tall intimidating amazon of a woman and she vows to make the students toe the line she even has a couple of the students act as monitors who report back to her with dirt on their classmates ms togar is especially determined to nab riff and put a stop to riff s anarchic shenanigans but riff has clever ways to foil togar at every turn kudos to the superb performance of mary woronov in her role as principal togar mary is a legendary b movie actress and in this film she plays the fascist ms togar with sneering relish pj soles as riff turns in an electrifying performance clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer has lots of fun with his role the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene certainly this is a good film for ramones fans but even if you re not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast literally of energetic fun 
__label__1 if you love the thin man series you will love this movie powell s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles there are even dogs the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy but it isn t half bad 
__label__1 this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not english but are an annex of the french province of burgundy the film features comic actor stanley holloway best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period the story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the canadian government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty the idea actually reminded me of the real life case of the hutt river province in western australia where a landowner seceded from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues rather like the tv show yes minister as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well 
__label__1 this is a really interesting film it s the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist for the director of notting hill this is a bold move to something serious
__label__0 ok i love bad horror i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of demonicus or house of the dead those were bad enough to make fun of severed was not it was worse spoilers who cares my friend and i sat through the entire film and i have a number of comments both in the this sucks style and in the realm of actual critiques plot sort of there s a guy in this city which is possibly seattle see comment below who is running around and cutting off heads he s been doing this for over a year i m not going back to get exact numbers thank you very much possibly two or three years one head a week and the police are just now calling in a specialist who once refers to himself as a psychic but that never comes up again schya right feds take over after what three connected homicides after nearly a hundred similar killings we d be under freaking martial law anyway this specialist consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time and the two of them come to the conclusion that it s baron samedi a voodoo spirit who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body and then presumably take over the world or possibly just go to disneyland um setting where is this happening well if you re not from seattle you might not realize that at the bar rave occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members there s a poster for a local radio station and that in the highly entertaining pulp fiction esqe dialog as if between the two cops yes the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick they discuss the new stadium which may still have been an issue when this movie was made being from seattle i apologize on the movie s behalf and hang my head in shame ok here s where it gets really critical being a horror movie writer not published don t go looking for my name in the imdb i do research lots of research and unlike the writers of this movie i know that baron samedi while a voudon loa spirit who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated by various christian oppressors with satan is actually a loki like trickster god in other words he doesn t cut off heads besides a major part of the voudoun religion is that baron samedi can have a body whenever he wants their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa not to mention if he s already possessed someone why make a new body also if baron samedi got a body he wouldn t go around cutting off heads he d get some good rum and cigars and par tay in summary the only thing they did get surprisingly right is that in the completely unnecessary tarot card reading used only to show that the voodoo chick is spooky they didn t screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do again i ve done research anyone remember the old late night ad for phone in tarot readings the lovers you will soon fall madly in love and all that nonsense if you made it this far through my comments i congratulate you and i m sorry again i ll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me so please don t 
__label__1 running man isn t a great movie in fact it s kinda silly but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment i don t see how anyone couldn t enjoy this picture it s so silly and over the top that it almost makes fun of itself by the way this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there 
__label__0 a bondage humiliation s m show and not much else the plot is flat really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set pieces the host of the aforementioned show a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing the dream like ending felt tacked on to the film s credit though aya sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead flower and snake has been compared with eyes wide shut but aside from some minor surface similarities kubrick s is easily the more layered artistic and atmospheric picture 
__label__1 this movie was made in 1948 but it still rings true today very very funny it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it builds from there anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing great cast cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40 s clothing architecture and family life many references are made to the cost of things and those comparisons to today s costs are pretty amazing i can t imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it a true classic 
__label__1 it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte s nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good nolte an american moves to germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out he s visited by a jovial american john goodman who persuades him to accept a post as an anti semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis nolte has no politics but thinks it s a challenge to write a role that s almost impossible and then play it himself another american secret agent will modify nolte s radio scripts inserting a cough here a sneeze there that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies there s a catch though nobody will know about nolte s real role as an american agent except goodman donovan and roosevelt himself if he s ever uncovered he ll be refused recognition by the americans nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany his adored wife sheryl lee knows nothing of what s going on nor does she care nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two the war ends and the trouble begins he s captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal they beat him and leave him in the mud he s rescued by goodman his fairy godmother who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then by 1960 he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor the painter alan arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists led by a dentist and a priest his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations he s beaten senseless by an ex gi but miraculously his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans another catch it turns out later that it s not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity it s not a happy ending nolte can talk with but not see the occupant of the cell above his in jail it s adolf eichmann eichmann seems pleasant enough he advises nolte that it s a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours it s important to relax you must learn to relax nolte laughs out loud and shouts that s how i got here the film is filled with such ironies at one point in their relaxed conversations arkin tells him that in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart i don t know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn t that s the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary the fact is that it s a movie for adults and patient adults at that the story moves slowly there s very little violence no car chases no shootings and people don t seem subject to manic speech pressure a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don t open themselves to its deliberate approach nolte refers to the war time relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two this is a pretty compact phrase no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import it s a story of a man who loses everything his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression i don t mean to sound condescending but it s the sort of feeling that s hard to understand in your youth adolescents might like to think they know what s holding nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring remember robert frost s line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in well no place will take nolte in 
__label__0 watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment it s the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed i m sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie oops that s not what happened the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released when it was finally released there wasn t the usual three ring circus of publicity if i remember correctly in houston it opened at drive ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne who was hot after having directed the not all that good joanna a film with music about young people in swinging mod london if i recall correctly fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could that s why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish an impressive supporting cast kathleen freeman jim backus john carradine andy devine and others is wasted with nothing to do to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda in amazing footage from the gang s all here andlaurel and hardy who never dreamed they d be playing in an x rated movie the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions however none of the characters seem to be having any fun maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn t bad to exploit them this was one of the youth pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the 1970 s one writer joked that easy rider which was made for pocket change was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success sixtyish once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never as best i know been out on home video or cable they re the studios deep dark secret raquel welch s performance in this is all things considered very good with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in she looks great and has awesome costumes mae west is the liveliest seventy something actress i ve ever seen on the one hand it s kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by but i m sure she needed the money if you want to see a big budget x rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls also from fox because it doesn t take itself seriously it s crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio myra breckinridge tries to say something there just wasn t anyone who wanted to listen 
__label__1 i would love to comment on this film alas my search has always endeth in vain if any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a uk vhs or loan him a dvd copy of the vhs he would without reservation be eternally grateful blake wrote the road to excess is the path to wisdom one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition if not i will have to replay the excellent mr russel s gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer for better or for worse have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of july 1816 whilst i a fellow member of this melodious plot rests his lonely case in solitude 
__label__0 i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure or they have a fascination with chickens they are on the make or beating each other up it s as if the scriptwriter said what can i make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is watch the wonderful human portrayal in one flew over the cuckoo s nest where the illnesses are believable and real i once worked in a state mental hospital i didn t see any of these guys these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life 
__label__1 i really enjoyed this debut by ring director hideo nakata if you ve seen ring beforehand then you ll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick it s got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant and predictable stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre if you like films that give you the chills then you will probably like this one a good creepy debut by hideo nakata 8 10
__label__0 the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker a young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived extremely boring and very predictable in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie avoid this one at all costs 
__label__1 i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you ll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city s diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris je taime s plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you ll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won t you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyone s opinion on art differs i m just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect 
__label__1 when a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague a variant of bubonic plague u s public health service official dr clinton reed richard widmark immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body unfortunately the stiff got that way by being murdered and there s a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague leading to an epidemic enter police captain tom warren paul douglas who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster while panic in the streets is a quality film it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight it wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster police procedural thriller and even romance this is not director elia kazan s best work but saying that is a bit disingenuous kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as a streetcar named desire 1951 on the waterfront 1954 and east of eden 1955 after all this film predates those but kazan has said that he was already untethered by the studio taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl the film is set in new orleans a city where kazan used to wander around night and day so i knew it well he wanted to exploit the environment it s so terrific and colorful i wanted boats steam engines warehouses jazz joints all of new orleans kazan handles each genre of panic in the streets well but they could be connected better the film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods the sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers edna and edward anhalt quarantine and some like em cold the gangster material which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film is probably the highlight not surprisingly kazan has said that he believes the villains are more colorful i never had much affection for the good guys anyway i don t like puritans a close second is the only material that approaches the panic of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed inoculate them and contain the disease while there is plenty of suspense during these two moods much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama with pacing more typical of that genre the dialogue throughout is excellent the stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced it is intelligent delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character conflict isn t created by dumb decisions but smart moves events and characters actions are more like a chess game when unusual stances are taken such as reed withholding the plague from the newspapers he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions which other characters argue over in light of this it s interesting that kazan believed that propriety religion ethics and the middle class are all murdering us that idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm or allowances away from it made by the protagonists for example head gangster blackie jack palance in his first film role is offered a get out of jail free card if he ll cooperate with combating the plague the technical aspects of the film are fine if nothing exceptional but the real reasons to watch are the performances the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue 
__label__0 it s about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions at times it is clear how most of the doctors are charlatans even lying about how they don t charge their clients while they are wearing their gold watches the donation box is mandatory notice that there are only a couple of people who get cured while we see quite a few cases keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee while the average salary in india is 1 700 ru month

__label__1 time for a rant eh i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 i m being a little bit generous with the 7 point 1 matt damon aggravates me i was thinking what a dicky voice they got for the main character when i first heard him narrate and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad his performance in the departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but that s another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfully point 2 brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed not once did i find the music to fit and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought i d start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super american freedom style lyrics i couldn t help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9 11 in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radio hit teen bop 14 year old girl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i can t believe no better could have been done i refuse to had it not have been for this i d rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok don t bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking too bad it s a shame they couldn t have hired better musicians i liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thick dark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent ok i m falling asleep here so i ll sum it up before i start making less sense nice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck ;)

__label__0 ah yez the sci fi channel produces yeti another abominable movie i was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where as the survivors desperately searched for matches at least a half dozen fires burned with no apparent reason at various points of the wreckage fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout they searched corpses for lighters and matches and finally finding a box built a fire every day for apparently 12 but no one ever gathered wood then when the vegan hah burned the bodies what did she use for an accelerant i mean these guys were frozen well maybe not despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate bled maybe it s just me but even in a totally unbelievable tale none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti or an abominable snowman until the very end if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable oh what did the prologue 1972 have to do with the remainder of the movie and the revolver warm enough to hold in his hand froze up and wouldn t fire gimme a break well at least we have carly pope another eminently lovely canadian lass and with little irony ed marinaro as the coach well i might as well add the rabbit they ate despite it looking like chicken is not a rodent but a lagomorph now if it had been a squirrel or a rat it would have been a rodent but it still looked like chicken and the writers missed a real chance to have someone note it tastes just like 
__label__1 i saw this 25 years ago on pbs it was very difficult to watch so real to watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending no time for courting fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work this was based on the woman s actual diary which i read many years later she said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves she learned to mow which was not lady like she was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun browned calloused hands but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy to do it both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home it was so so sad when the baby died of course if they had it today i am sure it would have been fine that only makes the tragedy extra sad i was crying so hard but then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf spring is on its way and life goes on in her diary she did have two more boys and they lived 
__label__0 if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over 2 hour movie about the french revolution and also didn t have any sets and had to have my 4 year old autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn t make the auditions of that year s soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didn t work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn t stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet mistakenly hilarious hell worthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel space laser battle i don t mean to spoil the movie for those who haven t seen it but that s not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace 
__label__0 a truly truly dire canadian german co production the ever wonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term problem child a few uears prior to the action the child murdered her father and mum took the fall for the offspring now she s moved up to the northwest us to start over but her child still has a problem in that she s devoted to her mother so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond unfortunately mandy schaeffer as the daughter murders more than people she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie though the incoherent script useless direction and appalling music check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini clad bod don t help any we re supposed to find her sexy and scary but she fails on both counts almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing not to mention the fact that arquette and schaeffer don t really convince as mother and daughter all condolences to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow both of whom are worthy of far more than this and both of whom particularly rosanna are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago one of the production companies is called quality international films not since the three hour love lies and murder from two short productions has there been such a you must be joking credit 
__label__0 crazed shotgun toting incest driven revenge seeking truck drivers obsessive control disorder daddy raped me when i was 12 handcuff carrying all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station ie skinemax at 4am on sunday nights and yes i know that was an entire sentence but bare with me people this is a long winded review for a short pointless film filmed in somewhere canada with almost no budget the plot to this freak show is trite the police in it obviously never heard of state jurisdiction because they end up chasing both miya hookers and trent idiotic anal retentive generic insecure college student all across the u s and i thought only the fbi could do that the camera is shaky the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like ishtar and leonard part 6 as far as the skin scenes go which is the only reason to even rent this movie don t even think of buying it there are two of them the first one is the only one worth watching though which is the dominatrix sex scene with kari salin and ____ insert unknown actor here he s obviously done nothing else worth noting in a seedy disgusting motel room the kind with the busted sink that drips and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it it s all s m riding crops handcuffs hot wax and underwear licking folks and in the end he gets left in a motel room with no money and cops waiting at his door that s goes to show you guys don t let a hooker tie you up in a middle of nowhere motel room sadly though kari shows no skin worth remembering and that alone can cause deep seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen so that is definitely a downer towards this flick as for the ending snicker snicker i know you probably wouldn t mind if i revealed it to you but i won t you should spend your hard earned money for that one all in all i give it a 1 5 for action a 3 5 for skin see last paragraph and a 0 0 for acting character development or intricate plot twists laughing man
__label__1 there s perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart having just said goodbye to my new fiancée of oh one day for an unknown period of time i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see i watched a few movies and tv shows but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven t seen for that i have this movie to thank being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand i was sure i was going to like it anyway but i didn t just like it i loved it the technical mastery is astounding how did they do it how did they capture the animals in the way they did it s just wonderful the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous it s a happy sad one again it caught me a bit off guard as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours perhaps it s because the ending made me think back to what i left but for those few hours on the plane i was happy to see something new and original and that s life sure there are those things you love and feel comfortable around but the great outdoors holds many a mystery so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open i m going to explore it observe it and embrace it that s precisely what happens in this movie and that s precisely what you should do with this darn good movie nature doc too 8 10 p s it s two months on from the plane journey we still don t know when we ll see each other again but we will

__label__1 valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good marley shelton did great as the female lead much better than jennifer love hewitt in the i know films david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene all in all it s a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again 
__label__1 the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission he plays a kind of james bond s psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt as an intense hit man his character is very sexual but even better very funny add the kind hearted uber likable american guy next door greg kinnear to set up contrast the myriad locations vivid colors and quick witted humor provide great entertainment hope davis is well cast as the gem of a wife but the focus of the film is on the two fellows a new odd couple and that s the part that works very well have a great probably r rated laugh and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper 
__label__1 recently i was looking for the newly issued wide screen dvd of fly away home and came upon interesting title that i had never heard of grey owl the fact that it was a richard attenborough film caught my attention he responsible for such fine films as gandhi chaplin and shadowlands i noticed that the screenplay was by william nicholson author of shadowlands this special edition was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under 10 00 so i chanced it bought it wow what a beautiful film pierce brosnan stars as archie grey owl a real life trapper in the 1930s who came to love and respect the wild lands of canada and worked to help protect them brosnan who starred in a james bond film gives a shaded warm powerful performance as does annie galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land especially the beaver a fine score by george fenton the crucible and beautiful photograhy by roger pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film and the extras on this dvd are something else includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real grey owl as well as audio commentary tracks by attenborough and producer jake eberts 2 featurettes and many other fine additions plus options for those having access to a pc with dvd rom features grey owl has been released directly to dvd in the united states a fact that richard attenborough attributes to hollywood s lack of interest in distributing something that isn t loaded with a lot of violence and sex this is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about i had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion and a whole new love and understanding for beavers grey owl is a very fine film worth checking out this is one i look forward to sharing with others 
__label__1 leslie charteris series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady simon templar the saint was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming george sanders as templar it was a careful choice sanders usually would play villains with occasional nice roles ffoliott in foreign correspondence the title hero in the strange case of uncle harry the framed best friend of robert montgomery in rage in heaven here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his heavy persona while his good looks and suave behavior made templar a fit shady hero like chester morris boston blackie and to an extent peter lorre s mr moto the films are not the best series of movie mystery serials but they are serviceable like rathbone s holmes series or oland s chan s series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones the anti heroine in the film here was played by wendy barrie who would show up in a second film in the series this and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers who hear the buzz of the dialog always showing sanders braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys without noting the obvious defects of the plot all these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can t avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for barrie which she was long aware of shortly after he tries to protect her from the police but as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind i e the script disguised him as the least likely suspect barrie is after the proof that her father who died in prison was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang she has several people assisting her mugs like william gargan and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can t be pinned on her the d a who got her father convicted jerome cowan is determined to get barrie and her gang the only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is jonathan hale who is shadowing sanders but reluctantly working with him the cast has some nice moments in the script hale currently on a special diet is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for sanders by willie best he gets a serious upset stomach as a result enabling sanders and barrie to flee sanders apartment best has to remind him when he feels better to head for a location that sanders told him to go to at a certain time there is also an interesting role for gilbert emery usually playing decent people like the brow beaten husband in between two worlds he plays a socially prominent weakling here whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a bogart movie on the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 it will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory 
__label__0 have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills 90210 were thrown into a thai jail if so this is your movie this is midnight express for the mtv crowd that would be ok but the story was poorly executed contrived plot twists poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound this slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out this moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint later the same hotel employee is somehow found and bangkok is a big city mind you ive been there and testifies against the girls as if a couple of free mai tais warrant 40 years in prison c mon rent another day in paradise instead

__label__1 man i really love the new dvd that universal put out i ve never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy grainy vhs tapes for years unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs it sucks anyway troubled fashion model alison parker cristina raines moves into haunted nyc brownstone only it s more than just haunted it s also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest john carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch angels don t escape this has an all star cast full of old timey actors like ava gardner arthur kennedy jose ferrer etc as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken jeff goldblum who s voice was mysteriously overdubbed and tom berenger and you won t even recognize jerry orbach from law order i had to do a double take when i didn t quite place where i d seen him before nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father s rotting corpse that s been possessed by the devil and there s a neat ending where disfigured deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won t be the next one to guard the portal it seems alison s troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel an excellent creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that shouldn t be missed i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy 7 out of 10 
__label__0 this movie is phoniness incarnate a straight 11 10 on the phoniness scale the fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering yanks although the real scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there don t expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out controversies with the locals also don t attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing there are a couple of infectious singing and dancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18 th century scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay new york city maybe it wasn t such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left brigadoon maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump watch it for the fine alternative reality view of what a christopher streed day parade in scotland would look like on lsd other than that i d only recommend it to hollywood muscial completists 
__label__0 i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don t think watching it from the beginning would ve made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors roy marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind solomon s mines the very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre school kid would ve been spell bound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day 
__label__1 this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff rather it s for those who either appreciate a good story or have grown tired of the run of the mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprah ish this is such a wonderful movie you must see it semantics tho she is right for once the story unfolds flawlessly and we are taken along a journey that i believe most of us will come to recognize at some time a compassionate existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise acting is without faults cinematography likewise occasionally quite brilliant and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story a warm movie not excessively sentimental 
__label__0 my take a tired formula christmas comedy the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too i love the holidays as much as the next guy even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues but it seems it s just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year but that doesn t make them any less painful during the season as if we already had enough santa clause movies three and gulp still counting who wants to see a movie about his brother in a plot that would be at home with disney s santa clause franchise save the occasionally crude humor and santa s little helper wearing a short skirt fred claus is a one joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes sure jolly ol saint nick has a brother but where does it go from there it s a shame really fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow but it would have been so much better than this vince vaughn is your typical snob but we are led to believe he s really the long lost brother of the never aging santa paul giamatti who invites his good ol brother to visit mrs claus miranda richardson is reluctant and worse an efficiency expert kevin spacey has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas and his this close to being shut down hah and guess who plays santa s mother kathy bates of course elizabeth banks is santa s helper charlene john michael higgins is one of the elves and rachel wiesz plays fred s girlfriend si don t know if i d praise the casting or to bash it here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality but they re given way too little to work with as for humor the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa s brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers where he is joined by stephen baldwin roger clinton and frank stallone but the giggles begin and end there worse still the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that s supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what christmas really means apparently what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can rating out of 5 
__label__1 okay i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst but it s not haven t s you seen freddy s revenge wtf that was the worst of all now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it s cool that he had a daughter etc etc and then i found out it was in 3 d i was so excited i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the 3 d sequences quite a lot was in 3 d though like lisa zanes hand dream demons freddy s claw more than once lezlie dean holding a knife lisa zane with a baseball bat doc s hand freddy s head exploding i truly loved this movie because it was in 3 d but i wish the whole movie was in 3 d not just the last 15 minutes by the way it s 15 minutes not ten 
__label__0  the bank 1915 chaplin the bank was one of charlie s 1915 essanay films while these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts this one seems a bit below average the gag with the janitorial double combo locked vault and the tough luck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream in which he is stroking the lead lady s hair only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow are both classic chaplin moments they are both ironically the beginning and the end the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl the mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not the mop seems to be charlie s alter ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn t with his own two hands interesting stuff but there s better 
__label__1 the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forth in the most nauseating scene the woman s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick re creations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms but gorehounds probably won t find anything special 
__label__0 growing up joe strummer was a hero of mine but even i was left cold by this film for better and worse the future is unwritten is not a straightforward behind the music style documentary rather it is a biographical art film chock full of interviews performance footage home movies and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from animal farm the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour the campfire format while touching in thought is actually pretty annoying in execution first off without titles its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are secondly who really needs to hear people like bono johnny depp and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man they were not relevant to strummer s life and their opinions add nothing to his story this picture is at it s best when strummer through taped interviews and conversation touches on facets of his life most people did not know about the suicide of his older brother coming to terms with the death of his parents the joy of fatherhood to me these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face there have been better more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash westway vh1 legends and kurt loder s narrated mtv documentary from the early 90 s come to mind joe strummer the future is unwritten is for diehards only 
__label__0 you need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i ll take a stab at one now episode valentines pay jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball hence explaining the missing wages she realizes her mistake and the usual oh jim you re so lovely the endanother very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we re so many now in terms of human beings with tvs these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you d get an audience two and a half men on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious 
__label__0 if i could say it was better than gymkata i at least felt my money was not totally wasted then i saw steven segal s on deadly ground this movie should see a resurrection though on mst 3k if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo s head explode one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say bitch slap me i was a writer on gymkata 
__label__1 i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to all the president s men in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially own them unlike all the president s men this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like the negotiatior with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals i ve seen in my life going back to watergate the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it 3 times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john cusak s accent 
__label__1 first nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child second the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future third this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes eva mendezes and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are mrs christian is not a light but a sun however dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one own eyes is not new but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can being a sign the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects i e the sign behaves like an object now in our usual world of perception it is common that objects change signs f ex if someone grows a bird his photograph will show him with beard not without as it did before but the opposite the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man this is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie this is new and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time 
__label__0 bob clampett s porky s poor fish is a so so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments set in porky s fish shoppe porky s poor fish occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black n white porky cartoon and one of the books come to life merrie melodies that were popular at that time typically of many of the early porky cartoons porky is far from the star appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for unfortunately the audience gets far less than they bargained for as was sometimes the case in the books come to life series the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non animated medium laughs are scarce and while the cartoon is just about saved by clampett s energetic direction there is very little at all to recommend porky s poor fish over any of the other below par early porky cartoons 
__label__0 this movie should be nominated for a new genre complete mess except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore this movie is a complete waste of time calling it campy doesn t even cut it campy implies fun which this movie was not you spend the first half of the movie thinking its got to get better right in fairness it does at the very end when its finally explained who the brother sister team are and what they want but by then you hardly care anymore because you ve spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr onorati ms pacula do to tick someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie 
__label__1 michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out iphigenia however is a highlight adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides it s a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a big film with the emphasis placed on the simple story in supplication to the gods king agamemnon kostas kazakos is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia tatiana papamoschou much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae irene papas kazakos and papas are both outstanding but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game strongly recommended for fans of international cinema 
__label__1 one of the best if not the best rock n roll movies ever and it s not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film doesn t at all take itself too seriously which is what s great about it i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late 1970 s it made me kind of nostalgic like i said this film doesn t take itself that seriously and isn t pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of it s not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated that s rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule 
__label__0 this show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them well at least corner gas was good at first little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1 who are the people who are watching this show anyway i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies maybe the jokes are for them and they work there i don t know a single person who likes this show and can t stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas hopefully it won t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could should have led to a great show 
__label__0 i like jane austin novels i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies and i m half way through mansfield park but i couldn t stand emma i gave up on the book after 2 chapters and by the end of the movie i couldn t care less about emma she didn t seem to change at all maybe it was paltrows acting which as excellent in se7en or my lack of interest for the movie dunno the costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer ehle i gave it a 2 basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor i liked his singing 
__label__1 ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever mariette hartley and g d spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon 
__label__1 i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon i have to admit that i ve never been a big baseball fan but i can sometimes get into a good sports related movie what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system people jumping from family to family biological parents not always taking an active involvement and transitions that can be but heart wrenching and heart melting joseph gordon levitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very believable performances maybe it was just my emotional state but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film 
__label__0 the lack of content in this movie amazed me the most first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on but i m really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on so so story horrible cast ajay devgan jamming with salman khan and asin you gotta be kidding me the music was okay khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad vipul shah hasn t still learn from singh is king s critically bashed comedy now asin where do she come from sorry for asin s fan out there but she suck d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn t look good at all overdose of make up my final verdict go watch aladin with your family instead wasting your time here 
__label__0 eddie murphy s delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of stand up eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes forget it unless you happen to enjoy eddie s foul style i don t think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script saturday january 17 1998 video
__label__0 note to all directors long is not necessarily good this movie is incredibly long however not good the scenes were drawn out way way way way way too long the sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10 it is way below average some other problems also exist in this marathon 1 ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree the guy who played the great grandfather looks nothing like him but the grandfather father and the son who gives us constant unneeded voice over are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull headed personality no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn this one is minor but if the movie hadn t been 3 weeks long it wouldn t have been so annoying 2 the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave 3 the love stories in this movie are totally wrong you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short suddenly people are in love and almost instantly married then having children then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie but with time spent nothing was given to us 4 the ending was just bad i don t want to spoil it for anyone but you won t like it either unless you are sadistic the director writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis i mean endless loop oops they are the same thing i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie a short description of the horse whisperer and sunshine sunshine perfect title if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave 
__label__0 generally i don t do minus s and if this site could i would give this movie 3 out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie i thought uwe boll s alone in the dark was the worst i ve seen yet but at least i gave it a 2 5 out of 10 in my opinion stephen dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne bloodrayne would win a oscar for best movie if they were competing now to the plot this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but they ve could have done better the start looked ok but that s it i had to fast forward most of it because the death s where boring i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths i m not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this sorry for rambling but there s nothing good to say about it because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this this thing of disaster uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake well sorry i couldn t explain the plot if there was one but that was the best i could now if you don t mind i m going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life ok not for life
__label__1 an adaption of the book finding fish this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher derek luke who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist jerome davenport denzel washington a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel washington this movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn t win an oscar i think it was because it was released at a bad time that s why it was overlooked i strongly recommend this film to everyone you ll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is antwone fisher if you like inspirational true stories then watch antwone fisher thank you
__label__0 i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason herb evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly that most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isn t much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie 
__label__1 very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment the script was very good as was the acting the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good 
__label__0 this movie may be the worst movie i have ever seen basically it is right above leprachaun 5 the only difference is that it missing ice t the scene where he does the chick with the carrott priceless oh yeah they made a second one genius
__label__0 this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew based on shielah graham s autobiography it seems like the powers that be couldn t leave well enough alone they couldn t decide if this was to be graham s story or fitzgerald s story and also how much they should soft pedal whoever s story it turned out to be so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating fitzgerald and notorious ms graham personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing however and this saved the film for me kerr has never looked lovelier and peck is as always a very handsome man they truly make a beautiful mature couple and i only wish they had better material to work with there is one scene that does work scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs other than that the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 peyton place the best of everything 
__label__1 i really enjoyed this movie britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you holly fulfills her dreams just like britney there are times in everyones lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens i would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams she will never know how much that means to me bravo britney you are the greatest 
__label__0 how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no redeemable qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle it failed to get even a single smile on my face i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack i m pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks 
__label__1 i really thought this wasn t that bad not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far patricia arquette was overacting much of the time he was actually playing cello which was very impressive and his lines were never forced besides he is an incredibly beautiful man really sexy add that to the talent and most anything he s been in is a lot more tolerable he always gives his all even if some of the projects he s been involved in didn t quite hit the highest mark not the fault of the actor in most cases he s unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn t resonate at the box office always with a list actors but just not always a hit but he is worth every penny of any dvd rented or purchased see the wedding date with debra messing one of his best overall films worth every penny if you haven t seen it yet do then you ll understand that quote 
__label__0 terrible movie if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 that should be banyo what a waste of time other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil the dialog is cheap and sexual clichés are all over it the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it i must have really disliked it to write about it this much jeez 
__label__1 four macho rough n tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear the motley coed group runs afoul of crazed vietnam veteran jesse an effectively creepy portrayal by alberto mejia baron who not surprisingly doesn t take kindly to any strangers trespassing on his terrain director co writer pedro galindo iii relates the gripping story at a steady pace creates a good deal of nerve rattling tension and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murder set pieces a nasty throat slicing and a hand being blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite gruesome splatter highlights the capable cast all give solid performances with especially praiseworthy work by pedro fernandez as the nice humane nacho edith gonzalez as the feisty alejandra charly valentino as the amiable charly and tono mauri as antagonistic jerk mauricio better still both yummy blonde marisol santacruz and lovely brunette adriana vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits antonio de anda s slick agile cinematography the breathtaking sylvan scenery pedro plascencia s robust shuddery stirring score the well developed characters and the pleasingly tight n trim 76 minute running time further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang up horror action hybrid winner 
__label__0 i frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market and sadly white noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor i was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static induced headache increased i found white noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by michael keaton i was totally unaffected by his demise up until the credits i diligently awaited for something anything of substance to connect me to the characters story but such relief never came sure there were the occasional heart stopper moments but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer while the acting was lame michael keaton may have played his studliest role to date perhaps the only redeeming quality that white noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of keaton s abodes overall white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves 
__label__1 those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie she is just plain cool her car is great and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all of the time plus more than a touch of mae west the sets are well done as well and the comic cast is great with edie mcclurg at her usual best plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious any time i have to crunch something for a topping i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips this movie is one to be watched again and again just for the fun of it now i have to get the sequel to it elvira s haunted hills and see if it lives up to this one 
__label__1 this movie pretty much surprised me i didn t have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary rhoda was very funny and well written they didn t spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren t relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very entertaining my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit com and i think i might agree with her 
__label__0 i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie i m still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn t quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood cliché imaginable all the while flogging us with the corporations are the ultimate evil message subtlety this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide it s own spoilers the story appears to be a computer nerd s fantasy world come true the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker i think among many other nerd fantasy come true elements that you ll have to see for yourself as well i should ve known it would be a z movie when i saw ned bellamy he tends to be a good tip off can t recommend this one i m afraid 
__label__1 this movie has always been my favorit disney movie then on 11 21 01 i saw the 30th aniversy of this movie dvd wow i remembered why i loved this movie the dvd is so great it has an extra 30 min that the original did not have i did not know this when i first started watching the movie made ever so much more since the music they cut out should have been left in you have not seen this movie until you have seen the full 131 min version a lot of people say that the music is forgettable i remember every song in this movie by heart every song has it s own charm by it s self and comes together as a hole i remember when i was younger i had the eglantine song stuck in my head for days at a time as well as briny sea that song was meant for marry poppens but was cut out of the film please watch the new uncut 30th aniversy movie and re vote for this movie the 10 that it really is 
__label__0 it doesn t take long to see why code name diamond head didn t make it onto the network schedules the tv pilot movie doesn t get past the credits before it s obvious just how bad it s going to be maybe i missed something because the plot didn t make a whole lot of sense based on what i got out of the muddled mess a terrorist or thief or something named tree ian mcshane goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon the world s dullest secret agent johnny paul roy thinnes is out to stop him there might have been more but trust me it really doesn t matter anyway action movies should have action suspenseful moments should have suspense and dramatic moments should have drama there s none of that in code name diamond head i ve seen others use the word turgid to describe this made for tv snoozer and it s better than any one word description i can come up with none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about and roy thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable his charisma is just slightly north of a slug ian mcshane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it but unfortunately for everyone else involved it doesn t appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member now if mcshane had been cast in the series lead well then you might have had something i m quickly discovering that these gawd awful 70s made for tv movies make great mystery science theater 3000 episodes and that goes double if quinn martin was involved very funny stuff from mike and the bots so while i may only give the movie a 3 10 i rate episode 608 a 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale 
__label__1 i didn t even want to watch this movie after reading maltin s review and 1 1 2 star rating i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected i would give it 2 1 2 stars out of a 4 star system you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all if you don t know much about religion you will miss a lot i graduated from high school the year the movie was made so maybe i can relate to it better yes there is some pretension in the movie and it s weird to some extent but that was the 70s so what do you expect i can see why people might not like the movie however i cannot understand people saying it is boring the movie is anything but boring you will either hate it or love it if you find it boring you are probably brain dead 
__label__1 a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after he s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he ll be transferring soon bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940 s it still remains as funny nearly 60 years later this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 my grade a 
__label__1 i went to see ashura as 2005 fantasia festival kickoff man that was one cool kick off the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere but due to health reasons he s still in japan oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies the plot is pretty simple but somewhat original the demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called demon wardens are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura the demon goddess who s sleeping and supposedly is very kick ass it brings us to izumo some kind of elite swordsman called demon slayer and his buddy jaku who s the typical violent jealous asshole seems boring well now it thickens izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater in a boat joyride on a nice night izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons for the good cause the cause of love and damn the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes he is the total package he knows how to fight hell yeah he knows he s witty he s intelligent and he has that grit you never have to yell no izumo it s a trap the guy already knows it he has that common sense he s really the perfect hero as far as cinematography goes the esthetics are pretty interesting it s by far the movie that looks the most like a manga it s creamed full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic it s pretty amazing lots of colours an unreal photography other than that it s pretty straightforward but like i said the main character is carrying the movie a must see a tale lead by masterful hands
__label__1 dahl seems to have been under the influence of wenders the american friend innocent nick cage gets recruited for a hit dennis hopper plays a real hit man lara flynn boyle is dangerous the hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city like it s predecessor mentioned above this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable but all lead to the cathartic self discovery 
__label__1 i first saw this movie when it was released in the u s in 1984 i have seen it many many times since what strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal this continues up to the climax of the film all these years later my friends and i still love to debate whether or not carmen is really stabbed at the end from the reactions of the other characters to the stylized murder it is open to debate the passion of the dance the quality of the acting the love of art and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that once again blends and twists the line between life and art 
__label__0 all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place dialog riddled with biological techno babble chintzy sets balsa wood acting a horrific late 80s casio score and an overall look that suggests anything on the sci fi channel s programming schedule circa 1993 though metamorphosis starts off with a lot of promise the film unravels into bland idiocy and mst3k style cheese as clark kent wannabe doctor peter houseman gene lebrock is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects but when he tests his vague experiment on himself he transforms into a vaguely defined creature that bears more than a passing resemblance to dr freudstein from house by the cemetery the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously low budget production though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason but overall metamorphosis leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise i can t help but agree with one character s closing remark it was a nightmare from the past 
__label__0 director ron atkins is certifiably insane this ultra low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one harry russo john giancaspro who also co wrote a nut job who receives a rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend he starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs rape and kill not always in that order what starts off as being a balls to the wall exploitation film well stays like that but it gets very repetitive very fast i m leaning more toward the certifiably insane it is hard to forget once seen though kinda like if tom green ever did a horror film my grade f eye candy laurie farwell gets fully nude jasmin putnam shows tits and bush anti eye candy seeing john completely naked repeatedly
__label__0 with the rising popularity of the now iconic godzilla series like with any hit cinema event there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard with godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju giant monster genre many sought after success a few gained it one of the few that not only profited but garnered popularity was gamera a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion but unlike godzilla gamera was marketed as a friend to all children later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril and thus gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies unfortunately that s about the only audience mainstream that the original gamera series will have any appeal to while the new gamera movies directed by shusuke kaneko are marvelous revolutionary monster movies the original series including the original is nothing special the first gamera movie titled in japan as the giant monster gamera was clearly a godzilla want to be even though the movie was produced in the era of color films it was shot in black and white why to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s gamera also attacks tokyo because godzilla attacked tokyo in the first movie i don t know much about the japanese version for the version i am familiar with the americanized version where scenes were cut and new footage with american actors were inserted is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first godzilla film now whether this adds or takes away from the film i cannot say but gammera the invincible is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself gammera the invincible is a very routine orientated movie the characters are from a stock of science fiction standards the story is inane the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization the acting is laughable and so on and so forth the only thing that differentiates it from the godzilla series is the ending of the movie but that s also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts gamera s rampage is completely phony and ridiculous now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie and although shusuke kaneko would later transform gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s in the original series gamera was not an attractive screen presence he was neither scary nor sympathetic he just waddles around like a toddler swaying with each step and knocks miniature sets over as usual everybody wants to destroy gamera except for a little kid yoshio uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a central role who thinks gamera is a nice turtle most movies in the genre that gammera the invincible is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure even in the company of many other godzilla imitators this gamera film is not a particularly good entry and as far as my cinema experience goes the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse like godzilla gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters and like godzilla he d get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again it s peculiar usually i recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes but in the case of gamera my verdict is just the opposite i strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s gamera trilogy directed by shusuke kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested the new films are inventive well made exciting and above all fun the original series is a long stream of boredom 
__label__0 the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant 
__label__0 the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china the movie is based on the novel by pearl s buck the story is great but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles walter connolly is laughable as the farmer s father he has such a heavy american accent as do most of the lead actors that i could not bear listening to him speak it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african americans 
__label__1 popular radio storyteller gabriel no one robin williams scraggy and speaking in hushed hypnotic tones becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen year old boy from wisconsin named pete logand rory culkin who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents to boot pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still since his partner jess bobby cannavale good happens to be a survivor of hiv himself he also acquaints himself with pete s guardian a woman named donna toni collette brilliant and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin he discovers some secrets he was naturally not prepared to find based on real events that happened to armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with terry anderson and directed by patrick stetner this film moves a lot faster 90 min maybe a few minutes longer than one might think a movie of this genre would run that s good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear it s bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn t sew up any of the plot openings or back story i d rather not go into any great detail except to say that if you are not familiar with mr maupin s works or his personal story you feel a little bit out of the loop here still the performances by williams i would ve loved to heard more of his narration personally collette cannavale culkin and much of the supporting cast the waitress at the restaurant collete s donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has are top notch and the mood established here namely the chilly lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york give a terrific framing for this story it may have ends that don t tie together particularly well but it s still a compelling enough story to stick with 
__label__0 power rangers the completely awful kid s show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with it s complete cheesiness and awful settings this show was not entertainment it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences the toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was as such it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made 
__label__0 as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta s shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse this movie is so bad i wouldn t even bother renting it from the weeklies section do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth 
__label__1 i grew up on this classic western series and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on sunday evenings to watch it bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs the series chronicles the adventures of the cartwright family who live on a ranch near virginia city nevada around the civil war era their ranch called the ponderosa is run and defended by the widowed father ben and his unmarried three sons adam hoss and little joe these three brothers have different mothers all of whom have passed away years earlier the cartwrights are a hard working prosperous and honourable family highly respected in those parts the ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding also trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth needless to say few of these excursions pass uneventfully although hospitable much of the cartwrights energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation the cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary they are involved in various town affairs even the political life of the nevada territory one of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present despite occasional disagreements between ben and his three sons and despite frequent disagreements between the three brothers now one brother might beat up another every now and then but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long the characters are all very well drawn ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity the oldest son adam the most rational and suave of the brothers left midway through the series the middle brother hoss is a gentle giant of a teddy bear who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies the youngest little joe is a hot headed handsome charmer who by contrast has quite a way with women this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible for whatever reason the actors are all stellar in their roles including pernell roberts adam dan blocker hoss michael landon little joe and of course lorne greene as the principled family patriarch ben i also love the ranch cook hop sing played by victor sen yung this is a wonderful action packed western with great values the cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous if only there were more programs like this vintage western on tv these days 
__label__1 what irving thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again making a chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of paul muni luise rainer charley grapewin and walter connolly among others perhaps it s partly because the story was written by a westerner pearl buck who got a pulitzer prize for her novel in 1932 ms buck daughter of chinese missionaries probably brought china closer to the consciousness of america than any other person not the political struggles of china but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in the good earth unfortunately later on pearl buck became an apologist for the kuomintang china of chiang kai shek in all its virtues and excesses the rest of her literary output never matched the good earth in the sundowners there is a great description of comparing china to australia by peter ustinov when asked the difference ustinov said china was very big and very full and australia was very big and very empty that s what you see in the good earth china very big and very full of people more than she can deal with at times the good earth tells the story of wang lung paul muni as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave the woman o lan luise rainer bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have drought famine revolution and a climatic locust plague luise rainer won the second of two consecutive oscars for portraying o lan she may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player oscar performance with the least amount of dialog everything she does practically is done with facial expressions her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles i think only john mills in ryan s daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture rainer helps in the field bears and raises the kids does the housework when muni becomes a man of property he takes a chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief still rainer stoically bears it all still muni is not a bad man and it s a tribute to the film and his acting and buck s writing that you don t hate him and the culture gap is bridged we ve got a group of oriental players now who do more than just kung fu movies i m surprised the good earth of all films has not been remade at this point i ll bet the chinese government would even let some american company do it on an actual location till then we ve got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy 
__label__1 yeah it is in fact it s somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies number 15 i think anyways i m usually not one for plots but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games final fantasy 7 for example and not movies but this one has it all vivid drawings of planets stars an extremely well written screenplay while this is not really for children they can still watch it it contains no graphic blood guts and silicone but i don t think they re going to understand it

__label__0 this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven t got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 8 10 it isn t just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce 
__label__1 h g wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935 very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades great cast includes raymond massey arsenic and old lace sir cedric hardwick ghost of frankenstein ralph richardson time bandits and margaretta scott early glimpses of helicopters holograms a rocket ship and futuristic cities this film was ahead of its time directed by william cameron menzies invaders from mars its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis 1927 but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come that was made in 1979 this movie has nothing to do with the original h g wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories a classic science fiction movie 10 out of 10
__label__1 seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic i happened to see the dubbed version but i m on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue still the dubbing didn t get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour poison clan rocks the world the story telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue suspense and inter personal relationships you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed it s like watching real animals fight each other but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film s genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution of course if you just want to see people pummel each other along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture be my guest 
__label__1 i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it i didn t know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the film s history all i knew was it was a highly acclaimed french film had i known more i probably wouldn t have viewed the picture with an open mind on paper the premise doesn t sound interesting to me had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited however not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it throughout i had no clue has to where the story would go what the characters would do and what the end result would be it was if nothing else not a predictable film indeed it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers since the lead character is seen in present day the audience knows she will remain alive by using the flashback technique director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard looking face one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood instead denis presents france as a beautiful girl someone who looks fine on the outside it could be argued that chocolat is more about france s mother since she is given far more screen time though i believe it is ultimately about france to me what chocolat is really about is how a mother s actions affect her daughter it is about how parents behavior stays with their offspring france is not ruined by her mother s actions in the story yet her mother s actions clearly made an impression on france had france not been affected at all by her mother s actions the flashback aspect would be irrelevant for a movie that deals with two time periods the past and the present chocolat was a very well paced there were no scene of excess fat none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place the film had nice rhythm the editing crisp leaving only what was necessary to tell the story with a well told story solid editing and organized directing chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen it was responsible for launching claire denis career and with good reason it s an incredible directorial debut

__label__1 one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries you ll ever watch while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western hemisphere while essentially another chapter in the story of the u s backed latin american coup this film chronicles in real time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political savvy and courage the political insights offered by this film are invaluable one gets clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of american politics one gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny which has been abruptly and illegally thrust upon them by the conspirators we also see the arrogance and fascism of the cia backed private media plutocrats and generals who ve conspired to bring venezuela back under washington s domination though ably led by president hugo chavez the people of caracas are forced to act without him after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals their response is the highpoint of the film if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the u s government hugo chavez and revolutionary venezuela are all about this movie is it 
__label__0 i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and incredulous the first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is naturally shaky but then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode even during quiet conversational moments to the point of ridiculousness have the rental houses run out of tripods and steadicams the fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn t help as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky for all the effort bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie s credibility a car would not erupt in flames after a single shot and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand held extinguisher a single humvee would not be driving around baghdad in 2004 but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack it would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target i believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base not some random spot in the middle of the desert the oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the green zone a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within the zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents oddly james never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves thus setting up the attempted kidnapping speaking of which the 3 man team is always depicted clearing buildings chasing insurgents etc on their own even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there how many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he s not faking it there were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where baghdad was in relation i had no idea who the eod team reported to nor were any other characters fleshed out these are things the characters would know so we should too many of the surprises and scenes are perfectly predictable yes it s obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the iraqis he s trying to move along that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle finally there was an almost complete lack of character development renner s character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home is reckless and addicted to adrenalin he s exactly the same at the end of the movie what s the point if this is indeed the best so far of the iraqi war movies it s a sorry bunch just based on the half hour i saw of it i d recommend generation kill on hbo instead 
__label__0 hanna barbera sucks the life out of another famous property the violence is watered down the stories are formulaic the animation is bad the music is obnoxious and repetitive and frankly the show just isn t funny at the time h b put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not thus popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen hey popeye is popular and the flinstones are popular put em together and you can t miss also in an apparent ripoff of private benjamin olive oyl and the goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits seriously why adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode standard practice at the time for cartoons but still annoying popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely recycling and are you ready for this the dangers of smoking i swear i m not making that up the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack mercer the voice of popeye from the early days continues the role here worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old fleischer shorts otherwise avoid at all costs 
__label__1 this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun s judicial system policewomen lawyers and judges despite tremendous difficulties lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants these brave strong women are making a difference this is a rare thing a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate hardworking women i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states the more people who see this film the better 
__label__1 there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz lang s m forget the 50 s abortive remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a facile pragmatist who s willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable max sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter imelda staunton this is one damn fine film its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no need to dip into gore laden slice n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films gore is present it s a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didn t like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else i ve talked with who has seen it 
__label__1 i loved it having been a fan of the original series i have always wondered what the back story would be it didn t fail to delight me i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn t recognise one person this is refreshing much like bsg it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent can t wait for the series to start airing well done to ronald d moore and team excellent job the special effects dialogue and acting were all spot on and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci fi stuff produced in the last decade 
__label__1 incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th intense personal and completely riveting 9 11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal up until that morning filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center and from there a simple documentary was no more viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster without hesitation naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it s entire support crumbles around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable is older brother gideon s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safety after viewing 9 11 and seeing that it came out in 2002 i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone s recent rendition the big budgeted world trade center many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought 9 11 all but renders his film completely obsolete not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again 
__label__1 an incredible little english film for so many reasons first it s a rare look a laurence olivier in a light comedy while his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot being english it didn t have the big budget of the hollywood films of the same era and it often shows but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an england that would soon be gone when we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest american counter part it happened one night were in their day as risqué as fatal instinct was in our time but after watching and enjoying this movie the first time i can t help but feel sadness when i watch it today with half of film shoot before 1950 gone saving the remaining films means hard choices and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important the color shifting lack of contrast and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking this movie along with it happened one night are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch or better yet why not a double feature 
__label__1 kurt russell whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the world s fair will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter there are times you feel that you re watching elvis until something snaps you back to reality perhaps memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen all the performances here are excellent season hubley as priscilla pat hingle as the colonel even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of momma presley kurt s dad bing is here playing elvis father vernon and there s a fine understated performance from robert gray as elvis buddy and bodyguard red west a must see for rock n roll fans 
__label__1 wow this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on 9 11 01 in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outlets those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower two s subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forget heart rending tear jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last 9 11 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made we must never forget 
__label__1 this electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from it s star the musical genius that is prince the film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers while this film isn t as good as 8 mile as a recent example this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better on the dramatic side of things the story centres around the kid prince a young artist and regular spot at a club the owner of the club is frustrated with the kid s arrogance and little does the kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival one the side the kid s parents are having trouble with his dad abusing her violently during the course of the film the kid learns a few lessons in life and learns to appreciate his friends more it s all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course but this is combined as a musical a very stylised musical the cast are good prince is actually quite good on the drama side when he s not striking a pose he seems human and relatable clarence williams is very good as the abusive father as well appollonia kotero makes a good debut as princes sexy love interest the main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack the musical numbers are well staged and electrifying prince is no doubt a musical maestro albeit very eccentric when he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste and occasionally his experimentation can miss fire but that is the same for many musical geniuses the soundtrack for this film is excellent though with only sexshooter being a weak point the show stopping performance of purple rain is the standout though it is one of my all time favourite songs 
__label__0 diana guzman is an angry young woman surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas she takes her anger out on the closest targets when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club she knows she s found her home the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual coming of age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which detracts from the dramatic tension the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category 
__label__0 i saw this film last night about 102 minutes and don t know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i don t see how gere a buddhist got involved in this violent sexist trash 
__label__1 ordinarily i really enjoy movies like chances are but i wasn t quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons the first half was pretty well done overall with alex finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body played by robert downey jr he meets up with his wife cybill shepherd and friend ryan o neal and his daughter who is now grown up the scenes with them meeting again and downey rediscovering who he once was are well done and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated but from there the film goes downhill there are several sex related scenes that turned me off completely especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now after that however the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible considering the circumstances of the plot i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end there was great potential with this story and the scenes in heaven are well done there is a good theme song sung by peter cetera and cher but ultimately the film is not great for a better similar film try heaven can wait decent but i really kind of wish i hadn t seen it because of the scenes in the second half out of 
__label__1 i remember this series so well it was excellent such strong and compelling characters stylish and sexy and so different to everything else on offer at the time and now i am sure that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama traders both season 1 and season 2 are available on dvd region 2 in the uk its a treat to watch the series again season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes unfortunately it seems to have ended after 2 seasons this series was a lot of fun sometimes you can get it on special at amazon co uk
__label__1 in the hands of a more skilled director this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece despite michael death wish winner s merely passable direction the movie is interesting original and more than a little scary the script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back several it can t shake including chris sarandon as the heroine s boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly d angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover john carradine does a heck of a job sitting in a chair and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown at the time chris walken this movie is creepy and creative the plot twists are lovely if a tad predictable the climax of which i will give no detail is disturbing and quite impressive again a better director could have done more with it nonetheless it is quite satisfying at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror if you like modern overproduced body counting torture fantasy you won t like this there is almost no gore the direction is quite spartan the effects are few although there s some delightful makeup near the end most of which actually isn t makeup but perhaps i ve said too much already i ve rated this a little higher than its quality may justify but i enjoyed it as much as any 8 film that i ve seen 
__label__1 the way the story is developed keeps the audience wondering what is the tenant s dark past we get some clues during the series but enough to keep us interested in the mini series the characters are all believable and i personally felt immersed and surrounded by the story 
__label__1 in a way this film reminded me of jumping jack flash remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine whoopi zonked out tranquilizers whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right that s how i feel about rich in love a man hears his wife sing for the first time post coital teenagers talk about the nature of love albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe but there s only the whisper of a plot here and you can t wait for it to get moving only when ex go gos charlotte caffey s the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up and then it s over this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer s day in the deep american south

__label__0 visually cluttered plot less incredibly mind numbing rubbish not even close to greenaway s better work avoid at all costs the overlapping split screen effects do nothing more than confuse the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the artistic composing of images is pretentious in the extreme there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film even the nudity is incredibly unerotic which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring plus how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me he showed more ability in the star wars series and that s saying something i ve not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw darby o gill and the little people 
__label__1  ship ahoy was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan puerto rico at the time in which the country was involved in wwii this was typical fare for the studios which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning as he pursues the beautiful ms powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra in which one sees among others the amazing buddy rich who has a few solos with mr dorsey and ms powell a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band backed by the pied pipers this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre which mgm totally controlled 
__label__1 does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i love it one of my top 10 films of all time it just makes me feel good i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over bebe benson michelle johnston is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are like apples and oranges the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe it s only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren t changed more than they are this is a very good film it is very satisfying that s all you need to know 
__label__0 worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech don t waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i can t believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didn t listen and i did waste my time and cash please don t make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made 
__label__0 i kinda liked the film despite it s frenzied pace but i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north it is definitely not montana north and never will be americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world and that is one reason why stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world s great nations even in jest i would never refer to the usa as alberta south walt would never put us down so why start now other than that the film was pretty goofy better luck next time 
__label__1 this film screened last night at austin s paramount theater as part of the sxsw film festival we were graced with the presence of director mike binder and stars adam sandler and don cheadle who took audience questions after the film it is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back the performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare the trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects this is a breakout role for adam sandler while he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with punch drunk love and spanglish this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor he deserves an oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as tom hanks did and jim carrey is also doing in this role he seemed to be trying to channel dustin hoffman in rain man although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than sandler s traumatized character both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of child like isolation and confusion don cheadle s performance is less surprising but just as good after hotel rwanda and crash we ve come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from cheadle he has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role but he too is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as sandler s character cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist together the characters played by cheadle and sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do in a way that reminds me of matt damon and robin williams in good will hunting they are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again reign over me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year the soundtrack which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful the filming in the streets of new york a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself is also quite beautiful the supporting roles by jada pinkett smith liv tyler saffron burrows in a very odd role donald sutherland and mike binder himself are all quite good writer director mike binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels this is a story about grief family healing male friendship mental health and the meaning of love reign over me does not disappoint the film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character driven charming films like reign over me 
__label__1 izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor he definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world it s a pity more americans won t see this stand up routine due to its pal only availability 
__label__0 this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany i find the wooden horse disappointingly boring the subject could have been thrilling suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way it s a collection of plain and poorly told events with no suspension and thrill the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel but the events are so plain with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge the latter half of the film is even worse they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film i am disappointed by the wooden horse it wasted the potential to be a great film 
__label__1 a great film the acting from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute with very few exceptions was wonderful i thought soni razdan mrs noble and vrajesh hirjee saurabh were the best of the lesser known actors even kurush deboo tehmul who might be accused of overacting presented quite a believable and familiar character another great thing was the camera work and the way it captured the energy of bombay streets the tranquility of gustad saying his prayers and life within the tiny apartments i liked the story of the wall that becomes a shrine and then gets broken down and the artists philosophical take on it it s great to see good movies on indian themes 
__label__1 i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i can t help but be entertained by it gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made monsters to carry a scene the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr is suberb and very entertaining to watch the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly some might consider it corny but i consider it classic filmaking and acting at its best one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades in short its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either 
__label__0 this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen there is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful to top it all off the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible bridget fonda s acting is decent but everyone else s acting is totally amateur i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut scenes bad transitions and acting that should have been re shot read the book and don t waste your time with this film 
__label__0 i m so confused i ve been a huge seagal fan for 25 years i ve seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposter s voice no less what i also don t get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sex appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky self assured attitude and his bad ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone 
__label__1 it was extremely low budget it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder however it does have a good plot line and its easy to follow 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car but within the first 20 minutes of the movie amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard then she see s her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot tub then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for and you ll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not overall good movie reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part 
__label__0 for starters hobgoblins tries to ape the more successful gremlins that s bad enough but they don t even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here instead it s more like a bargain basement everything must go clearance of embarrassing scenes inappropriate sound fx acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws em down the old tube aroo the plot grrrr meddling kids track down gremlin like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies sound cool does it well see that wall on the other side of your room run right at it top speed face first see that is cooler than this movie you dare to doubt quick name something else one of the leads has been in other than this what other scripts have the writers done since hobgoblins name another rick sloane directoral effort how many hobgoblins action figures do you have see thank you i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film i d rather write about more important things like the separation of church and state economic restructuring in europe that kind of thing but no hobgoblins it is and it is bad bad like your grandparents wallpaper bad as pink flamingos on your lawn bad like underwear that says home of the whopper and i think we ll stop there well mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might they can do only so much with hobgoblins before they realize that yes the director does need kicked in the shin real real hard one star for hobgoblins seven stars for the mst3k version 
__label__1 this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the passion suffering and death of christ accounts in the new testament what motivated judas if money was not the issue what could bring the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day why did pilate waffle it is a movie for the serious thinking christian fans of the passion of the christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization as for myself i find the portrait painted here of the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own self interest is at stake far more realistic and deeply unsettling the disinterested just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in christ s wrist is as chilling as any moment in film the film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts it is a slow film but if you accept its self imposed limits it is after all the death not the life of christ ultimately a very rewarding one 
__label__0 how can a movie have ozzy osbourne and still suck i just don t get it trick or treat managed to do it this sucks and likes it trick or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about it is a vomit inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself trick or treat has no redeeming factors for a movie about heavy metal it sure doesn t seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986 probably one of heavy metal s strongest hours that is quite a feat however negative trick or treat so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it that simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film 
__label__1 this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around shahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values the movies doesn t get 10 as it isn t very good at music which counts a lot in every movie besides this it is flawless 
__label__0 this could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain had they played this flick tongue in cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like re animator or dead alive but juan piquor simon plays it tongue in cheek in spots but straight more often the premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat eating monsters albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot health inspector michael garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy the climax is a laugh riot unintentional at that which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is story no new ground charted here simon seems to play the gore elements tongue in cheek but the dialogue is straight had simon worked with a clever script one with plenty of one liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film violence you won t be letdown here we get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant the blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes acting wow michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film making endeavor is kim terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold your face while you scream bit the teenagers were all horrible actors no exceptions man this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs nudity two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched in a poorly done scene by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl s bedroom both male and female nudity here 
__label__0 this movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas capped by such statements like we all create our own reality sorry folks reality is what true for all of us not just the credulous the idea that anything s possible doesn t hold water on closer examination if anything s possible contrary things are thus possible and so nothing s possible this leads to postmodernistic nonsense which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas well founded and stupid are equal to quote sci fi writer philip k dick who put it so well reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesn t go away 
__label__1 sensitive film does lack brilliance and to some degree narrative structure but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed however the narrative structure point is debatable while it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a story i m sceptical as to whether this feel needs a narrative structure that is definite and detectable inevitably it will be compared with somersault in that its central protagonist i m not sure that s the correct word is a young and very young looking woman whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her although of course cate shortland s film tackles this aspect better but while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a cliché peaches is in some ways much more ambitious than somersault perhaps that s where it doesn t quite make it it s certainly very different to monahan s first feature the interview i m not quite sure how the sex scenes between weaving and lung added to the story who knows maybe they did they certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of weaving s character although i personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes just saw the film again on a second viewing i can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature but i m not sure how distinct these categories are anymore or even if we should be making that distinction in any case i do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from hallmark efforts on the other hand the film s structure is very formal and its content is hardly challenging at least in the way somersault tom white three dollars the illustrated family doctor look both ways and the human touch are the performances are all good but i did come to the realisation that the main reason i was enjoying the film was because it fit the australian genre without necessarily adding anything and i can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person not to like it indeed it wasn t until lung enters the room in her vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch but that leads us into another debate should we expect that a film must challenge us all the time certainly i enjoy being challenged by a film or a book or other people but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story i haven t deleted my initial post on this film because i m all too aware of the orwellian overtones of such an act but i would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6 5 as for nominations for afi best film my votes go to the human touch three dollars and look both ways and i think look both ways should win 
__label__0 you ve heard it said to live every moment as if it s your last whether it s your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of revenge

__label__0 being a fan of billy bob thornton and the diversity of his skills i noticed this movie listed and was surprised i hadn t heard of it i d traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 2 1 2 years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production now patrick swayze can t act for sour apples but thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them and charlize theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint dry being curious i checked this site s production info it made a whopping the story is pretty benign and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings on it s something like several snl bits all pieced together none individually too great at all and the overall presentation even worse whatever the expenses for this production had to be considerable even if all worked for less than their usual fees so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and billy bob s present albeit understandably somewhat laconic here compared with his usual work think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in sling blade bandits and bad santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this one star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical lifetime flick

__label__1 an absorbing although repetitive and rather didactic analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option but even here in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and no future that does not work and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with a simple act of charity gives some reward even if it just makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past although there is little actual on screen violence this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindedness of oppression politically and personally that does not make for easy entertainment clearly based on a play with a small cast a broader more expansive relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience

__label__0 of all the movies i ve seen this one rates almost at the bottom haunted mansion nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom it is hasty the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer s door the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous and illogical oprah gives a palatable appearance as bigger s mom but is not nearly at her potential other famous performers also seem to be at their worst the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk now the family he s working for are not against blacks but he thinks they are so when he comes home he puts her to bed but she begins caterwauling the blind mother yes hears this so bigger tries to silence her but instead smothers her now fearing he s really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do he shoves her into the coal furnace so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace the idiot didn t have the foresight to get rid of the ashes he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom if your desperate for a bad movie this one could do the job but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40 s and 50 s or see a good drama there are a lot better options avoid this 
__label__0 i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and co wrote such excellent screenplays as adam s rib and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and or directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated the script sinks to it s nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen s character tests drivas s character to make sure he s not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun 
__label__1 sydney lumet hasn t had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight well cast suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground new york city how he got insurance let alone the budget after all those flops is a mystery also the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents the only victim is going to be the insurance company the robbery goes awry and two people die most of the film is concerned with the aftermath the action is non linear and seen from the main character s differing points of view but it is not difficult to follow what is not so easy to work out is the back story how did the brothers get into such a mess there are clues the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father and vice versa but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin using murdering embezzler as the scheming older brother a corpulent philip seymour hoffman dominates the film but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his bullied inadequate younger brother albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that marisa tomei as the older brother s cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance i ve seen in many a year the film literally starts with a bang but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly i don t know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly masterton but i suspect that like lumet s great 70 s film dog day afternoon it is based on fact it s too silly to be untrue lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys this isn t a classic of either sort it s a well crafted piece of downbeat entertainment it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one but still wondering as to how they got that way we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant well like tolstoy we have to conclude that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way 
__label__1 i ll keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it s badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it s not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it isn t too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives gangland violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one it s very nearly perfect in my view jmv
__label__0 this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we re not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools after the basic version download die hard fan here on a dial up modem eventually got here i hit my first snag media player mplayer classic winamp failed to open it on my xp box and then totem xine kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server mplayer managed to run it flawlessly going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it the film beautiful soundtrack superb lighting masterful camera work and flawless texturing everything looked real and then the two main characters moved and spoke and the movie died for me everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters except for proog in the dancing scene looked fluid and totally alive the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut scenes that entail less realism than this any frame in the movie is fantastic as a frame and the thing is great if neither actors are moving i m so glad i haven t actually recommended this to anyone i d ruin my reputation oh and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn t for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen 
__label__0 this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off i know these horrible things happen in the world but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species this should be banned and destroyed i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market this movie should be removed from the public the person who made this movie needs psychological help 
__label__1 words can hardly describe it so i ll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the arabian nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu s battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie georges perinal s photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka stairway to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean akira kurosawa and orson welles as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old 
__label__0 if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children if you ve seen the movie you know that is no longer the case this movie was horrible main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute i wish i had never seen this movie it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left do yourself a favor go see something worth your money cause it s not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back 
__label__0 yet another venture into the realm of the teen gross out comedy set on a college campus featuring a nerd s quest to coolness and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl it s all been done before and it s all been done in a far more satisfying manner the gross out humor that has made teen flicks like american pie and dude where s my car so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove the film is badly written and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable i won t even dignify this terrible picture by divulging as it s a waste of my time and yours at best slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable jason schwarzman who impressed in his debut rushmore humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast please avoid please avoid save your money 
__label__1 this is a good film for 99 of the duration i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim it is shot in a rather naive fashion this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the nutcase called joe however the wholesome normal characters are a little too pathetic for my liking granted they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott the film starts slowly and the naive camera work smacks of b movie to start with and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur this is one of the most twisted movies with respect to cold hearted violence after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the eeriness and nail biting scenes earlier on in the film give it a watch and excuse the ending 
__label__1 anyone who loves the rheostatics music is going to enjoy this film i have some minor complaints mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors not maury who aren t really convincing in their roles but i don t have time write a detailed review i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader s digest version of whale music don t watch it it cuts out entire scenes and subplots if you can them that from the film the cbc which presents most of films untouched took half the guts out of whale music i don t know why it s horrible what they did to the film rent the video or watch it in a theatre but don t watch it on cbc television 
__label__0 spoilers all too often hollywood s shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text films including branagh s henry v and 1993 s much ado about nothing are powerful pieces of work watching love s labour s lost therefore it s such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste sadly love s labour s lost is awful the king of navarre alessandro nivola and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france alicia silverstone and her entourage arrive soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the prince s mind from the start you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by ken branagh the plot is still there and the script remains but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste classics like the way you look tonight let s face the music and dance i m in heaven are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just don t belong here aside from weak singing we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles the main eight actors four men four women are all equally dire and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy spall in fact only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that s the consistently magnificent nathan lane lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester costard there s little else to be said really love s labour s lost deserves mild praise for branagh s original take on an old tale unfortunately though that s where the positives end weakly acted performed sang and constructed love s labour s lost is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made a poor disappointing choice by branagh and here s hoping his next effort is better 
__label__1 the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died don t you dare say that pokemon sucks i don t like it when people say that i ve liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years so everyone should enjoy pokemon including this movie and other pokemon movies so without further ado please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages and also why do pokemon haters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies i don t understand they shouldn t do that there s absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that 1 pokemon is for little kids only 2 pokemon is stupid and 3 people shouldn t like pokemon i think this is why people don t like pokemon 
__label__0 i liked the first movie but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board the general idea in the first movie was if not great then at least very interesting this sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie and though christopher walken is still good as gabriel the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous if you haven t seen any of these movies then get the first movie and forget about the sequels they can take away all of the joy from the original 
__label__0 i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could donate it to the home for aged actors total rubbish five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn t one single laugh to be heard lots of yawning though paltrow s a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so called comedic movie 
__label__0 this is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on dvd television moved out of my life in 1981 so i never followed the series or any part of it which means that i m immune to the nostalgic charm that moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers possible spoiler warning the pilot of moonlighting is your basic caveman meets fluffball yarn where a charming red blooded he man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs the premises that the script s wit is based on must have already felt stale around 1950 it also contains some frankly bad writing as in the scene where maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance i often feel that susan faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment but in this particular case i m all with her moonlighting has backlash stamped all over it in one sense however this dvd is a must for all serious bruce willis fans in addition to the pilot episode it contains the screen test that landed willis the job both features show to what amazing extent willis acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988 89 die hard 1 in country impressive rating and i _am_ a bruce willis fan 2 out of 10
__label__1 after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixer upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there s not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that it s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later especially if you ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isn t an abundance of death and destruction in the film there s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the point the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that it s in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peter s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made for television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isn t worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but it s worth a rental and it s definitely worth watching for free 
__label__1 don t listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago the sarah silverman is wonderfully bizarre surreal immature ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line up if silverman tones down the juvenile doody jokes and emphasizes the darker meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled strangers with candy but just from watching the pilot its just solid not outstanding offbeat dark comedy musical but with huge potential silverman has created a hilarious child woman of a character a prettier younger jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional non stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can t wait to see how this show unfolds 
__label__1 i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour i was really confused about who was who for example bill paxson s character had long hair and was wearing a jacket then when all the males arrived at camp it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson but wasn t i said where s bill paxson then there was a guy with his girlfriend he said she was 21 this was supposed to be a 20 year reunion of the camp director s alan arkin most memorable later on this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased one guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend alan arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth the best part was that none of the grown up campers were successes in life none of them had very great careers this seemed very real life the movie was compared to the big chill in some ways it wasn t as exciting as the big chill but it was a lot more realistic so even though the beginning is not promising the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one 
__label__0 i happen to be the director s nephew it s taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time my uncle doesn t even have a copy of it anymore i asked i m looking forward to bringing him a copy currently the film s average rating is 1 9 10 as far as i can tell that should put it somewhere in the mid 30s in the imdb bottom 100 however with only 206 votes it hasn t yet placed it s sad that the film doesn t even get the respect of a bottom 100 title anyhow i m giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts best worst gift ever 
__label__1 mysterious murders in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat horde plaguing the terrified community this surprisingly effective little thriller was created by majestic pictures one of hollywood s poverty row studios the sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost expressionistic quality overall it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort even though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development the film can boast of a good cast grave lionel atwill gives another one of his typically fine performances this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle beautiful fay wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely alarmed dour melvyn douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who also happens to be conveniently miss wray s boyfriend maude eburne who could be extremely funny given the right situation steals most of her scenes as miss wray s hypochondriac aunt elderly lionel belmore plays the village s terrified burgermeister and little dwight frye who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the frankenstein and dracula films here is most effective as a bat loving lunatic 
__label__1 this is one of the best fred astaire ginger rogers films or at least one of my favorites most of the a r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs the music is the central theme here and what s nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure she dances also with fred of course and they re always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor growing up in the 1950s watching ozzie harriet on television it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty although she had that short early 30s hairstyle i recognized her voice right away also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball i can t find her but i know she s in here astaire except for some obnoxious gum chewing in the first third of the film was fun to watch and randolph scott although better in westerns is likable too this is simply a nice feel good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers 
__label__0 what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70 s 80 s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop 
__label__0 after the overrated success of amenabar and balaguero spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies the result is all in films like el segundo nombre a tv like production bad written but acted and directed even worse i didn t read the ramsey campbell book but i m sure that the author of the doll who ate its mother didn t have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless you re searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater 2 10
__label__1 this is the weepy that beaches never was as much as i wanted to love beaches it always seemed too hurried for me to feel for it its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though stella on the other hand moves at a slower and occasionally too slow pace and though it s somewhat manipulative in its tears inducing tale about a self sacrificial mother it works because bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances 10 10
__label__1 another one of those films you hear about from friends or read about on imdb not many false notes in this one i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead end home town in tennessee to florida with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten up car the heroine ruby makes some false starts but learns from them i found myself wondering why why didn t she lean a bit more on mike s shoulder but she has her reasons as it turns out just a fine film the only thing i don t much like about it i think is the title 
__label__0 i went to see this film with fairly low expectations figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff sadly it wasn t even that i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out i went with my two kids ages 10 and 13 and even they kept asking how much longer after lasting until the end i just kept wondering who would approve this script even the reliable fred willard couldn t save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot i d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie i use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing 
__label__1 overall i thought it a very nice movie i hate to use the word nice as it s rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong what i liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings all gilded and shiny this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good strong writing thank you julian fellowes d nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp i e not sensationalised greatly when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen well you couldn t get a less glamorous hand over of the crown it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert though somewhat fairytale ish on the face it was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people fitted together despite the union being initially arranged my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind so much said without any words that s what film is all about blunt held her own beautifully as well she has a face that demands your attention and i can t not mention the costumes that she wears every one simply gorgeous if i was blunt i would have trouble parting with any of them the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well harriet walter as queen adelaide being a highlight the only qualm i have is that it lacked a sense of urgency or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting it was rather tame i don t know i wanted something to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more when she and albert argued i loved it i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments though that may be just me lastly at the risk of sounding all patriotic it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position especially in one so young this may be in part to the fact that this film s snap shot of victoria s young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in the sword the scion but nevertheless it did flag up those feelings for those following my book can you guess what character victoria so aptly reflects it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn t seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation which only in turns renews appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic domain it made the government appear rather useless nothing much has changed then i suppose blog on films and books http sempergratis blogspot com:D
__label__1 and a made for tv movie too this movie was good the acting in it and the plot was just so great this one of the only movies i ve seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie but it s very easily over looked antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on four times and it too kicked was great if you ever see this movie come on tv i d watch it the effects in this movie were pretty well done i honestly don t know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn t suck so bad watch it it s really good no really it is 
__label__1 if you have any clue about jane austen s production you ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but i like austen s characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow she s very good in her leading role also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious 
__label__1 all i can say about the necromaniac schizophreniac 2 series is if you are even remotely pc or don t have a seriously messed up sense of humor then you probably wont get it as sick and disgusting as this movie is it really is a comedy and not a horror movie at all if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it s comical then you must see this to believe it this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn t touch this with a 10 foot pole with a condom on the end in my opinion though the best most extreme pieces of art come from way underground if you don t stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing then they reject it i have seen stacks of terrible boring z grade indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvd r i have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars when a no budget film like these two from ron atkins john giancaspro come out and blow all of the other shock films completely out of the water you really have to take a second look at the whole indy movie scene after seeing this you can really see how much freedom an indy film maker can have when they work on their own the funny thing is even the other people who saw this movie and hated it admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it i don t think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two so if don t take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously and are able to laugh at a misanthropic puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped you have to see this you may just be able to see it for the stand alone cult classic that it is both schizophreniac schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds 
__label__0 i m not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls shock movies do not an oscar make 
__label__1 i just watched holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective it is amazing the sound mixing camera angles directing and acting are all spot on additionally the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non exploitative it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend i ve had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals once in the us and once in netherlands i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved just listening to conversations after the screening people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation i highly recommend it to everyone both for its cinematic value and its subject matter 
__label__1 hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry s mission their focus on homosexuality depression war and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive in season 6 episode 1 countermeasures there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked

__label__1 i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate there were good romanian actors around they just didn t have complex roles i applaud puya s entering the movie business i don t know why but i think he s a good guy i just hope he ll be a good actor the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting plot i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award bafta good luck in romanian 
__label__0 this norwegian movie is so crap the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so wannabe hollywood the only actor who did a ok job was haavard lilleheie 3 10 if you want a really good norwegian movie watch buddy great actors and a feelgood story 9 10
__label__0 there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since given the very low average rating given to the film by other people i think you may draw your own conclusions this is a very bad film i ll admit it i thought the concept was kind of cute and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work but it didn t take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known acting the leads seemed competent enough but everyone else terrible plot chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through direction non existent humour did they really think people were going to laugh oh boy eye candy ok there were some really beautiful women in this film not just the three main female characters but right across the board it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn t notice how terrible everything else was if so they failed miserably in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic it wasn t even close 
__label__1 during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally unearthed for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has weill gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and weill only underscores its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the modern segment is weakly written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june haver both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii salute to our country s history albeit in a never was framework the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits 
__label__1 this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u s it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is another good film from this era rendition was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the u s is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination a clever plot good acting some big stars john cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans don t like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are complicit in mass murder 
__label__1 i rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it i had the opportunity to purchase it on dvd a few weeks ago and have watched it several times since i would have to agree with others when they said indian summer was nostalgic film when i watch it i wish that i could be 10 14 again i think that is why we all like the movie to some extent we all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom knowledge of adults wouldn t it be nice to have all your friends parents be young again to not have to worry about your job being a parent etc i know that i would like to jump into a de lorean and go back in time while i enjoyed the film very much my all time favorite camp film though is meatballs with bill murray i wish that they could make an indian summer version of that 
__label__1 billed as takashi miike s first family film by people who haven t seen zebraman presumably yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family friendliness diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors but i think it s probably just that he wanted to do something different he s really never been a one trick pony but often gets accused of it perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless it s a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into there s a very cartoonish feel to the production evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects aren t going to be seamless hollywood style work some blue screening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stop motion and puppetry i think the little sock puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the cuter for it the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job it s so hard to find a pre teen who actually understands the concept of acting but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie eared river princess yum yum those looking for another violent perverted gangster film aren t going to find what they re looking for in yokai but if you re a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit there s plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you ve got :) :)
__label__0 you know i went to see the hills have eyes 2 wanting to like it i really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around even though i still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me bloody intense and great special effects in short a great popcorn movie for any horror fan which brings us to the hills have eyes 2 man where do i start the plot or lack of one is paper thin we are not exactly breaking new ground here the military has decided to monitor the area and all of these people turn up missing so what do we do now let s send in the national guard to investigate in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen gee i ve never seen that premise before to make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion once again the special effects by nicotero are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck it was bloody and graphic but i found it predictable boring and not scary at all for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought wes craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this isn t one of them 
__label__1 this movie is bufoonery and i loved it the dragon lord jacky chan and his buddy cowboy totally made the movie fun meaningful and just plain silly the movie is a rare blend of a good vs evil fight and somehow the wonders and fun that is growing up long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord so named because he is the son of a wealthy family and cowboy which include implementing clever elaborate ways to escape studying with the help of the entire household including the tutor competing in rather boyish and idiotically interesting ways to gain the affection of a local girl competing in soccer you will see what i mean and the list goes on somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people the movie has its serious moments but they do not depress but rather inspire the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange but is actually employed against evil what i really loved about this movie is how it ends not the typical confrontation which in itself was awesome but well you ll see let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie silly witty meaningful and nostalgic great movie 
__label__0 1st watched 11 7 2002 2 out of 10 dir john bianco pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather like family in brooklyn who like to say four letter words a lot and kill people the only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang this is the only attempt at good film making the rest of the movie was predictable and cheaply made the quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your dvd player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound the acting was pretty much characatures of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like vinnie knuckles and jimmie tattoos and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well so go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one 
__label__0 much like orson welles thirty years earlier mike sarne was given the biggest train set in the world to play with but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe despite post modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today how anyone given the resources at mr sarne s disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely guarded secret only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes heaven s gate both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio s largesse whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey joanna in his locker furthermore heaven s gate could boast some memorable and well handled set pieces where tragically myra breckinridge s cupboard was bare simply put it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood 
__label__0 i was given the book version of kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it s over soon the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he s bullied by neighborhood kids which i don t blame them because he s a little douche bag the story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché about a boy who s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea it s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it s an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot 
__label__0 this sleek sexy movie is a must see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left untouched style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really connect with internal horror this film exhibits the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely defines the word masterpiece 
__label__0 very bad film very very very bad film it s a rarity but it defenitly is not worth hunting down this italian jaws rip off makes little sense most of the time and no sense the rest the alligator is not at all convincing and many of the sub plots go nowhere if it s at the local video store you may want to watch it if you re a fan of monster movies but it s not worth hunting down 
__label__1  five days is billed as something special a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes each set on one particular day of a police enquiry but in fact this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories in fact one almost can t help drawing comparisons to the last prime suspect as one of the sub plots focuses on a single cynical female cop approaching retirement and it s not just the absence of helen mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable there s a lot of earnest over emoting manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic in another suspicious and it s possible to guess the guilty party well before the end not because of the internal dynamic of the story but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole certain things must be true to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times in spite of these failings the series grew on me by the end i was quite gripped but it s a sad sign that the bbc which once made the likes of the singing detective boasted of this of possibly the best drama of the year for there s little true originality on offer here and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing five days is in fact not rubbish but it is formulaic and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh 
__label__0 as has been stated countless times the hills have eyes 2 is not a remake of the generally disregarded mid 80s sequel to wes craven s 1977 original but wishing to give this postmodern sequel to a remake the official stamp of diminishing returns craven himself a double threat alongside his son jonathan has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality in plain english horrible former music video director martin weisz takes the reins from alexandre aja and is clearly in way over his head yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the cravens screen writing 101 scrawl not only are the characters in this case a gang of goofball national guards wo men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls played without a lick of irony mind you but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren t funny after viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise their fate against the repulsive roaming cannibals is painfully obvious only this time out as in the original 80s sequel the script is so simplistic barely existent actually that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks we re treated to a combo childbirth murder during the opening credits plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven t ejected the dvd by the midpoint even the mutants in this outing are personality free freaks of no memorable stature the tacky rubbery looking makeup fx seems like the rest of the film to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment i really groaned at the lame surprise at the end of aja s otherwise excellent film and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of hills 2 setting the stage very lamely setting the stage for a third installment yet the cravens and weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977 2006 versions work that they d be hard pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face 
__label__0 i saw descent last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and being a fan sounds pervy i m not of rape revenge flicks of the 70 s i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out my conclusion let s stick to the classics yes the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat the actors unconvincing even dawson is empty some would say that it s a right depiction of the college world in the us that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity i wasn t expecting anything irreversible style but still aren t we suppose to feel compassion for her i didn t not for a minute she was so lame all the way and i read that the photography was impressive well it is good indeed but nothing ground breaking either i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn t so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie i couldn t help thinking i feel like watching argento s inferno again lol more seriously the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american canadian border in lynch s twin peaks fire walk with me the crude red and blue lighting the heavy bass music the general lascivious decadent atmosphere no i just couldn t get into this movie too bad ;)
__label__0 i never quite understood the popularity of saban s power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate americanized version of japan s ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version characterization special effects etc of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect i m sure if they spoke japanese they would learn how much better super sentai is over the american version power rangers is completely awful try super sentai instead looking for a better show try voltron the third dimension instead 
__label__1 this is an incredible film i can t remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered it s funny it s tragic it s compelling and most of all it s a slice of swedish small town life it crushes the clichés and dwells deeper it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her father s 70th birthday crossing paths with people she hasn t met in several years although the story itself isn t unique it offers a fresh approach the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who aren t very close or at least don t realize how close they are one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast first i m more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so called a list swedish actors in this film usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva röse to prove that you don t need words to convey an emotion the writing is also very appealing the dialogue is more than believable and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two it s ahead by miles maria blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didn t know you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film i can t wait for her next one once you start watching this you really want to see it through 
__label__1 i had watched snippets from this as a kid but while i purchased blue underground s set immediately due to its being a limited edition only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule and that s mainly because bakshi s american pop 1981 just turned up on late night italian tv see my review of that film below anyway i found the film to be a quite good sword and sorcery animated epic with especially impressive looking backdrops the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score the plot again wasn t exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed especially interesting is the villainous ice lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well endowed her bra could be torn off any second and half naked to boot her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass still it s clearly an action oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving darkwolf being particularly savage the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains lair inside a cave in the long run apart from the afore mentioned frazetta backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian 1982 and the beastmaster 1982 but also animated tv series such as blackstar 1981 82 and he man and the masters of the universe 1983 85 as for the accompanying the making of fire and ice tv mark bakshi 1982 1 2 vintage featurette on the sword and sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live action performances in a studio of segments from the script which would then be traced blended in with the backgrounds and filmed still having watched several such behind the scenes featurettes on the art of animation on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets for instance it s doesn t make for a very compelling piece 
__label__0 i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billy s movies but couldn t remember this one and now i know why it s so full of clichés and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesn t even get to be funny very often he s too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor 
__label__1 brilliant execution in displaying once and for all this time in the venue of politics of how good intentions do actually pave the road to hell excellent 
__label__0 save the 8 97 you ll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg i m a filmmaker and being an avid fan of h g wells i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment instead it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn t stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time it s horrible there are reports that timothy hines had a 20 million budget for this production where the heck did it go did he use most of it to buy a new house finance his retirement or what let me start with what is actually good about this film it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible and i do mean horrible special effects any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi to me most of it looked like stop action card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a 20 million project should be using there s no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than 1500 00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created i ve seen films with budgets of less than 2 million look better much better in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines special effects in this film in fact i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film there s no excuse with today s technology for a film to look like a 50 s b movie unless that was the intention which shouldn t have been with this particular project a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky another demonstration of amateur film making overall i have to say that i produced a 45 000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead it would be easier on the eyes 
__label__0 this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i can t give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other i probably wouldn t say anything that everyone else didn t say already the only other thing about this show is that it s pretty nasty with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and he s the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air it s always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick i m getting really really tired of stuff like this 
__label__0 after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come undone i must say i was rather disappointed the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed the characters despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting the sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be i ve never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot the ending is very anti climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn t explained well to begin with in my opinion a waste of time 
__label__1 since the start of her career in the 70 s and vastly throughout the exuberant 80 s elvira cassandra peterson has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror bad monster movies while ms peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures covering a wide variety in genres it was her tv character elvira that brought her the most fame part of her charm and respect from the fans lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous unlike many other big name actors actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their early work i ve seen only bits pieces of her tv performances but her cameo role in ghoultown s recent tribute song mistress of the dark really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video over the years elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid 80 s came around and in 1988 after films like fright night and terrorvision incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv work it finally happened elvira mistress of the dark the motion picture now i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film a few years ago i did manage to watch elvira s haunted hills made in 2001 but for some reason it didn t impress me all that much was it really that forgettable or should i give it another watch i actually really do feel like re watching it now as this first elvira film from 88 really convinced me though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script there really is no way to deny it cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy she also co wrote the screenplay when elvira learns she s one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt she never heard of before she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas out to claim her rightfully inherited money she travels to a quiet new england town but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her often unintentionally provocative behaviour to make things worse her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected a rundown mansion a cookbook and a poodle but what she doesn t know and her evil uncle vincent albot does is that her great aunt was a witch and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable and if you haven t turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe book then rest assured you re going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face it s surprising how a script rigged together with boob jokes witty one liners movie references inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story simple of course but coherent while other movies heavily relying on gag like situations often make you loose track of the story completely like the naked gun films for example this film doesn t a lot of horror comedies were being produced during the 80 s but not a lot of them actually worked let alone a horror spoof that doesn t derail at some point killer party although i m grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale or becomes too tedious too quickly saturday the 14th although elvira is more comedy than horror it doesn t loose track of what it s doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot including a real honest to god witch hunt and elvira s very own burn at the stake moment i m telling you there s no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already when daniel greene s name appeared daniel who oh yes i recognized his name and later on his dim witted macho face how can one not forget daniel greene once you ve seen atomic cyborg aka fists of steel but if you haven t seen atomic cyborg then i m sorry but you won t be able to laugh with his face in this one and on a side note i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better

__label__1 an excellent movie superb acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene cara tony king was very realistic in his role of satin this movie was one of the last predominately all black movies of the 70 s and unlike the blaxploitation movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very well done the movie soundtrack sung by aretha franklin was popular on the r b charts at the time 
__label__0 i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie 
__label__0 pretty standard b movie stuff seriously anyone who watches dragon fighter with dean cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence b movies exist to re work formulas that are popular if you give them even token analysis you ll wind up ruining the movie for yourself and perhaps writing some self important slanderous review on imdb i liked the female lead kristine byers she had charisma and i thought she was notably attractive it was a memorable b movie appearance unfortunately i don t see where she has made any movies since i ll watch for her again 
__label__1 when our local tv station first launched it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming lock up your daughters was duly aired and i swayed by the opening few seconds of the film popped in a blank tape best thing i ever did the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life complete with appropriate accents christopher plummer s foppington will leave you in stitches as will hoyden and her family double entendres abound plot line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene and risqué comments are made on a regular basis i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece a lost treasure as much for the cast as for the story to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release i ll be at the front of the line 
__label__0 i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing kitamura rocks editing and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2 but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off however these are completely 2 different movies the pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise if that is possible i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight the fight with the spider guy straight out of an episode of monkey in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam azumi s rampage at the end was unconvincing but aya still does an okay job she looks great in the cape but where did she get it from i don t think i will be watching this one over and over again what a pity :(
__label__1 daniel day lewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer the film however is a very difficult one to review or even watch fortunately i had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter i can t say it s the sort of film i d want to view more than once nevertheless my attention was held by the story telling device a flashback framed by the present in which we see christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him who certainly gave him loving care daniel day lewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist fiona shaw much to his mother s fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken there s a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much brenda fricker does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until day lewis begins to have success with his work she complements day lewis performance as the warm hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film both fricker and day lewis won oscars but hugh o conor and ray mcanally are also excellent o conor is christy as a boy and mcanally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy summing up elmer bernstein s music is an added plus factor well worthwhile but definitely not a film for everyone 
__label__1 what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust is i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of light speed to make it quasi modern stardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger played wonderfully by david kelly one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained and very sexy young lady named una she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain while the witch is away una seduces ben and sends him on his way ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect a baby boy the boy named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man charlie cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another nevertheless the young lady named victoria and played sienna miller goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wall meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold the old king perfectly played by peter o toole is dying he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne his sons names are primus secondus sextmus and septimus the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne anyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila that what brings the star to earth the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine clare danes and she of course is wearing the charm but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain the princes and also an aging witch named lamia michelle pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth complicated yes but it all comes together as the adventure unfolds tristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesn t recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love but he must get past the princes and lamia first the princes aren t that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the caribbean never has death been so funny but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother though he doesn t know it s his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert deniro his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinary michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia a sexy evil witch claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine she makes a perfect damsel jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spirits moreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times it s that good stardust is what movies are supposed to be perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other words perfect 
__label__1 now either you like mr carrey s humour or you don t me myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and on the other hand cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream but you have been warned if you re not sure watch the trailer i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film if you don t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny don t bother with the movie carrey a reporter stuck in a rut covering lighter news berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better carrey gets into the swing of having all of god s powers by making his girlfriend jennifer aniston s breasts bigger getting himself promoted and answering everyone s prayers by single stroke computer commands this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable but it is very well made within it s very limited intent provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow minded god squadders and anti god squadders on the more thoughtful level the film tempts us to speculate about carrey s own career stuck in his comedy typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes his most accomplished straight role the man on the moon is less well known that his comedy romps or the truman show on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey 
__label__0 the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer director star or is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this you want to make a movie tell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads if i m to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy

__label__1 having seen most of ringo lam s films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual it s a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest china town in north america like i do if you can find it don t pass it up 
__label__0 no this wasn t one of the ten worst films of the 1980 s but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere this movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 how else would you explain special effects pre dating an american werewolf in london disco still being considered cool and ronald reagan not being the 40th president of the united states while we re at it let s not overlook those 1970 s hairstyles in the 1950 s and 60 s i ve seen more of that here than in happy days laverne shirley combined the one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad it s good category was the late great elizabeth hartman but just barely biff plays as miss montgomery the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot a stereotype that s been done to death and is still being churned out by hollywood today but even as a hot chick she retains her mousey qualities her call for help is evidence of this she also looks much better as miss wimp seven bucks at the beauty parlor shot to hell she wasn t kidding this isn t to say that there aren t any good parts elsewhere they re just few and far between and i m not just saying that because i like hartman incidentally teen wolf was better than this teen wolf too was better than this and that wasn t even so good 
__label__0 this movie was definitely the worst movie i ve seen in my entire life and i ve seen some pretty bad movies i didn t like the way this movie was filmed all of the actors are unknown and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie but it s absolutely horrible i ve never seen a worse movie the story is so fake and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie there was no plot it looked as though it wasn t planned out before they started filming the story is too weird i didn t like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie there was no point in even filming this movie if you re considering watching this movie don t you re just wasting your time 
__label__0 i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can t get over the fact that she is even in such a piece stupid stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental 
__label__1 after seeing the trailer for evening you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved i mean they even got rocky horror s own brad barry bostwick to show the world he is still acting and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie while not entirely true the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer and that isn t necessarily a bad thing this is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her life the one that got away her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and harris killed buddy soon plays out no matter what happens though the film is not about these people and what they do good or bad it is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life what may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen the story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature our filmmakers here decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present ann on her deathbed dreamstate ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind and the past ann meeting harris at her best friend s wedding there are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring but overall it is handled better than at first thought it s not as though ann s life now is uninteresting it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned while i grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for ann s children currently i was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as i maybe should have there are some nice moments though for instance the crash that awakens ann from slumber being mirrored later on and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together it is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid these performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when our time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next no matter how annoying i find claire danes angry sad crying face that exists in every role she plays the girl is good at what she does i find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing patrick wilson is always great in whatever i ve seen him in you must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year from angels in america to last year s little children the guy will soon blow up but hopefully he will stay true to the craft and not cash in heck even mamie gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother meryl streep who surprisingly is in the film very little she is still rough around the edges but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day the real revelation though is hugh dancy i feel i ve seen him in many things but in fact it seems only in king arthur dancy literally steals every scene he is in and the way in which his role of buddy is devastated by love alcohol life is etched in his facial expressions throughout without his performance the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse while not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table you may be able to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together but you can t argue that the acting isn t worth sticking around for maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see however when it is all put together there may also be something coming out of it that couldn t have been achieved without all the other story threads either way the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it 
__label__1 i really do not know what people have against this film but it s definitely one of my favourites it s not preachy it s not anchored by it s moral it shouldn t be controversial it s just god any possible god no matter the religion and it s really funny jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final straws are executed he s quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until he s guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous ground ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly well as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place carrey s pitch perfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a it s a wonderful life wannabe jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you don t think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you re watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couple the movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey s career which wasn t goin anywhere 
__label__1 several years ago when i first watched grey gardens i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it but after many viewings i ve come to see the beauty in the strange twisted relationship between the inseparable big edith bouvier beale and her daughter little edith bouvier beale mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term shabby chic with innumerable cats raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day the result is a hilarious beautiful sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love and their lives an example of drive determination and free will this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself 
__label__1 this is the best movie i have ever seen i ve seen the movie on dutch television sometime in 1988 that month they were showing a yugoslavian movie every sunday night the next week there was another great movie involving a train rather than a bus the name of which i don t remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at vannoord let rug nlthe next week there was another great movie involving a train rather than a bus the name of which i don t remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at vannoord let rug nl
__label__0 this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was b movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell i m still laughing so as a shake your head in disbelief movie this one does well although it appears to have some known actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort the graphics might have been good in the 60 s or even early 70 s but come on this is 2009 i wont give spoilers out let s just say that if you have played jurassic park on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this filmit is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
__label__1 it s a weekend i ve been watched this funny film and i really like it all the kids are cute who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking it s a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night which could make lots of memories and laughters kid s humor always work nice acting as well simple story but cool shooting nice job for directer to find the kid s way when it comes to the kid movie i think of 12 and holding another one this year but differed aspect to the kid s world which is real and cruel awesome work h2efw focuses on the happy side of childhood which every kid and family need p s twitch i think is the voice of nemo from finding nemo 
__label__1 in my case i liked this movie because when i saw it i found more than i expected i mean this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after i finished it talks about death vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid point of the film that s what makes this movie so good the ability unique in don bluth director to play with the people s feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time that and the fact that it has so many good characters like charlie and ann marie that in the sad but happy ending you have to say i have something in my eye to hide the others that you cried all i ve said are just only some of the good points of this movie as for the rest you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest don bluth thank you 
__label__0 i only watched this because it was directed by lucio fulci and featured claudio cassinelli an actor i like i was certainly disappointed the idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for tv ratings has been overdone with rollerball logan s run blade runner and the new film death race which will certainly suck me in because it stars jason statham this was just a bore for the most part the kill bike action was ridiculous the training was a snooze fest it just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including dallas star jared martin or fred williamson pick one of the others mentioned and you ll be better off 
__label__0 a short review but avoid at all costs a thorough waste of 90mins at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened it s full of cameos stephen fry 3mins jack dee 30 secs the philadelphia girls and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn t make any sense whether the story just got lost in the edit i don t now but jeez put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest 2 out of 10 for the cameos and a morris minor car chase 
__label__1 brilliant my wife and i joined the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film festival after seeing the film i can understand why there was such a long line holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people she is a young girl he is a worn out westerner the film grasped every bone in our body there aren t any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut the film is beautifully shot among others we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle thuy ngoyen s rawness cant believe this is her first acting job and ron livingston s performance stayed with me for a couple of days highly recommended 
__label__1 got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date with an excellent performance for cusak tomei and all the supporting actors excellent plot very well placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed choreographed very funny all in all i give this film a big thumbs up it s extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle east and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who don t share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic 
__label__0 i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982 i remember dialogue from tatum o neal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burton s character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didn t translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awful this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70 s and 80 s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speak circle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didn t see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again

__label__1 i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise i left the theater with a smile on my face one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story hilarious it has some great character actors in it too mindy sterling is in it and is very good i loved her in austin powers howard hesseman is also terrific i remember him from head of the class i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made this is fun and light and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd i will definitely buy it 
__label__0 lucky me i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in texas horror flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you i ve rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of worst killer clown movie ever made from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy i m sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one from all indications it was shot on dv and it doesn t really look all that bad quality wise for digital but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts the story slight and cliche as it is goes as follows an executive ken hebert who also scripted and co produced with the director takes skeptical co worker tracy amanda watson and horny married couple mark and susan hank fields and chris buck along on a weekend getaway to a yawn secluded cabin 12 miles from the nearest town on the way there they pick up a bitchy slutty hitchhiker melissa bale in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin pot smokin friends disappears one by one with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates the killer clown doesn t even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being morbidly obese it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes i cannot say enough bad things about the cast especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times doesn t really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense originality intelligence general coherence or humor i could go on for days on how inept this film is how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is but i ll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy this sucks kind of way also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s i c k serial insane clown killer it s currently catalogued under its original title of grim weekend score 1 out of 10
__label__0 this movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy it is an extreme tragedy it left me sick to my stomach i hated it i think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer i would not have seen this movie if i would have known i think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie i am tired of it i really wanted to have a fun comedy and i am extremely disappointed it has been several days now and i still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie i have never been more disappointed in a movie nor have i ever written a comment on a bad movie i really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie no one would have seen it 
__label__1 several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives all are transformed at the end of the movie adela antonia san juan leads a brothel her daughter anita monica cervera is retarded and has a restricted life leire najwa nimri is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend maricarmen vicky peña has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife isabel ángela molina is a bored rich lady other characters are used to connect the five main women characters in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience the shoe theme is driven to extremes for example when leire as a shoe designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints she breaks one of her heels in editing small connections are made between the scenes a telephone rings a cigarette is lit a song etc are used to make the connection and fast cuts frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tv levels it is strongly music driven to set tone and atmosphere the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters one of the more moving shots is when anita who makes the same walk every day widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually using the soap like stories as the simple backdrop there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful as ramón salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level including the acting adela s love life isabel s doctor the shoe theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor this is often compared to magnolia because the structure is the same but they are different magnolia is more technically competent but somewhat mechanical this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually after seeing this you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie city madrid 
__label__1 the pervert s guide to cinema 2007 if loving cinema makes me a pervert so be it if you are a true moviefreak like me then i m sure you can t get enough of films about film making and i don t mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience well if that s the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you in sophie fiennes sister of ralph joseph if you were wondering has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive and often outrageous takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing probing and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings socioeconomic political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging determined and near frenetic dissertations to go from explaining how the bates house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego superego id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman although i had no idea who zizek was he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese with his sibilant tongue and passion the host comes across as a mad prophet fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick lynch hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz the red shoes and fight club there s something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film s themes even if they are freudian jungian to a fault then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video it s the only way to appreciate it 
__label__1 this show was great it wasn t just for kids which i thought at first it is for the whole family the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son he sadly passed away in season 2 i could believe it when i heard it i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made it must of be so hard for them to film this you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday secrets i still think the show was strong enough to go on i was disappointed that it ended it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday 
__label__1 it follows block heads and a chump at oxford two films that are hard to top not that saps at sea is a bad film it is the last good comedy unless one insists on jitterbugs or another of the later films that laurel hardy made it s just that it is a toss off little film without the crazy destructive crescendo of block heads or the astounding sight of stan s real personality in a chump at oxford to revel in at 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit but that actually is not a bad point for it it has just enough time to it to hit the right notes it s just not as special as the other two stan and ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns i suspect that there was a bit of chaplin influence in this sequence one recalls a similar assembly line incident in modern times only four years earlier ollie s nerves finally snap and he goes on a rampage he goes home and naturally his roommate stan does not help stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument you ve got it a trombone after beating up the poor professor ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor engineer ben turpin in a nice brief appearance and then faces his doctor jimmy finleyson and his nerve tester a balloon that inflates as you push air out of ollie s stomach finleyson announces that it is a bad case of horniphobia and ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat s milk they end up going to a ship but ollie and stan know nothing about seamanship so they plan to sleep on the ship unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off also unfortunately on board is richard cramer an escaped dangerous criminal this is not going to be a peaceful vacation saps at sea like a chump could have been three shorts one at the factory one at the apartment and one on the boat each would have been a successful short and they all make a funny film but the stitching of the parts together shows there are some very amusing moments in the film the discoveries of how turpin s ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment the accidental remarks of building manager charlie hall when stan or ollie runs by him and asks for directions can you help me find the basement asks stan certainly you can t miss it it s downstairs says hall who realizes what a stupid comment he just made and cramer s mistreatment of his two hostage slaves he calls ollie dizzy and stan daffy an allusion to the dean brothers of the st louis cardinal teams of the 1930s see dan dailey s the pride of st louis cramer has the boys cook him up some food and they make a synthetic meal boot laces for spaghetti for instance to get him sick to be overpowered when he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves their reactions are brilliant saps at sea is not on par with the top line of laurel hardy films but it is a good film on the whole and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career 1927 1940 when they were with hal roach in the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and roach had serious problems involving production costs our relations where stan was producer on the film artistic problems scenes from swiss miss were cut meaninglessly and contractual arguments leading to ollie appearing with harry langdon in zenobia stan and ollie hit back with the flying deuces wherein the production was not roach s but boris morros at last a two picture deal of a chump at oxford and saps at sea concluded the arguments and problems and on a high note the boys left roach unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been 
__label__0 this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer s part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn t do anything for me i still don t really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person s life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i can t recommend this movie to anyone 
__label__1 i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards much the best drama of the piece is in the mid section and then it plays as melodrama arising from the high concept science fiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over the top as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardson s mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey s aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the small fry nature of his kingdom it s not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of it everytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the things to come seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal life yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasn t got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedged bet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say it s not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in 1940 well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly 30 years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such contraption in 2036 a technocratic socialist we don t believe in independent nation states type government in britain after 1970 hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable anti war sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship whether boneheaded luddite fascist as under the boss or all hands to the pump scientific socialism will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in 1936 there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers vision on other matters much of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from 1940 would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashing eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isn t explored but then this was the 1930s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for richardson and scott and chapman slightly i would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous yet the script is ultimately over earnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate things to come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a metropolis tis much as silly in wells words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it ;)
__label__1 we watched this on the wonderful world of disney on abc last night and i came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at the mouse than usual since this movie only runs 74 minutes and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time they had and i m not making this up commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes and during these commercial breaks they had another advertisement in the guise of a tv show hosted by the oh so annoying kelly rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of cinderella 2 dreams come true again and again break after break disney took time out of the real movie to tell us the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel thank you disney for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie anyway all this commercialism and cash register ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of cinderella because by the time the commercials were over i had forgotten where the story had left off but of course the original cinderella still maintains its magic and the story is still a good one though we ve all seen it countless times it s a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow up 
__label__1 i ve been intrigued by this film for a while in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb a 9 0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film how had i not heard of this film before this website well you can t always trust the ratings this is actually a very good film preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication excellent acting by the principals especially william haines as brown and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard yale football game but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 obnoxious self centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place becoming in the process a caring self sacrificing friend i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels the predictability factor is high still it starts out very well and is certainly deserving of being remembered if not praised to the heavens maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard men edit now 600 voters and the score has actually climbed to 9 2 seriously folks there is ballot stuffing going on here i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than metropolis or the general 
__label__0 ok i kinda like the idea of this movie i m in the age demographic and i kinda identify with some of the stories even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi realistic and in a different movie would have been forgivable i m trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did but it s not that easy when the filmmakers weren t trying at all the editing in this movie is terrible possibly the worst editing i ve ever seen in a movie there are things that you don t have to go to film school to learn leaning good editing is not one of them but identifying a bad one is also the shot oh my god the shots just awful i can t even go into the details but we sometimes just see random things popping up and that in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience this movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also i ve seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity joe greta i don t know what the heck you were thinking but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos you should be ashamed of yourselves in conclusion this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene if that s not your kind of thing avoid this at all cost 
__label__1 mesmerizing breathtaking and horrifying this hauntingly beautiful film is the apocalypse now without fiction slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom there is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to consume the host and die with it manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience at least i ll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again 
__label__0 blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense at one point some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels exploring they begin to discuss what they ll find down there and one of them a girl says she bets they ll find a blue monkey yes thats it totally inconsequential to the story the only sad connection to the title and no idea why she would suppose she d find a blue monkey in a hospital s basement i m embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose 
__label__0 poorly written conspiracy drama mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find despite the cinematography itself being commendable the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey grade d 
__label__1 i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it s awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of who s going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it what s even happened to patty dunning now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s but we haven t heard from her since i know for sure about thom rachford who plays jerry works for accounting at rd films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school 
__label__0 i couldn t wait to see this movie about half way through the movie i couldn t wait for it to end all of the white actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said say it like this then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen it was so annoying we all know how will ferrell really talks and he doesn t stumble over his words like mr allen the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan and this movie definitely has not converted me i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction this movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies i have ever seen 
__label__1 best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials period this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent however a gold god don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself its zorro and his band of men to the rescue reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is there is a reason that i ve seen this the most of any serial i ve seen its simply a great action adventure film the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period its super and highly recommended 
__label__0 okay i m not going to critique this film in depth i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me and as i generally like maria de medeiros i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment and in such fashion nearly a year has passed but each time i see that dvd on my shelf i sense an inner groan anyway let the elogious voices override me but for other cinephiles like me beware expressed in simplest and gentlest terms here s my stance the political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life via newspapers i read daily in my local middle european pub at that time i followed the newsreports but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring the reporters tended to report either in non partisan terms or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris berlin prague and various places in the u s all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time but dictatorship or not my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment not as a well fleshed out evil empire to use flippant star war terms so week after week i read of disturbances but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them or evaluate the practices and social economic impacts of the dictatorship etc so in purchasing this film i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest and to enjoy a well conceived drama this film gave me neither the film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts and the drama well as i said i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry but it was trite and shallow i obtained my copy of the dvd from france selection official cannes 2000 un certain regard the box shows smiling clean shaven actors the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny after seeing the work i wondered what the french could have thought of it though as a shallow piece of cinema verite with sensitive ethnic content i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its honesty but look at the back of the box un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution a warm regard try describing allende s overthrown and murder with a a warm regard try it with czechoslovakia in 1968 try it with the whole line up of overthrows and civil rebellions another review maria de medeiros a renoue avec son pays son enfance et son histoire rubbish rubbish rubbish at least for me i love portugal in all of europe lisbon barcelona and prague are my favorite cities but my love for a city and a country doesn t flesh out a vacuous film i ll hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa meanwhile i m stuck with a zone 2 by the above title that might as well go in the trash 
__label__0 this film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentional the plot was beyond ridiculous i don t even think a 2 year old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film makers tried to slap together into a story however on the positive side some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor for example wow lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard it gets worse and even funnier but i ll spare you the acting is generally laughable most of the kids roles are sort of cute but not very believable on the other hand annie is pretty awful all around the adults don t take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing if they d tried to be believable the film would ve been even worse which is difficult to imagine once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almost not crappiness the scene where lady hogbottom s son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though it s an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police the butler character while very minor is a ray of sunlight that almost but never quite pierces through the gloom watching this movie actually caused me physical pain nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a 5 unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 thus i give it a 3 that s being pretty generous i d say 
__label__1 it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn t see and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit 
__label__0 as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont pines yes palms no and the same for the wedding service again nice grove of palm trees when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express did they ship themselves overnight in a crate come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo the two should have switched roles the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
__label__0 i m all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war this ain t it and for that matter neither was the emmerich devlin gibson the patriot but i digress i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios now sony just before it came out the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran robert dillon directed by the esteemed hugh hudson of chariots of fire fame and starring al pacino but it didn t take long for people to start squirming in their seats whispering derisive comments about pacino s horribly misconceived accent he was supposed to be an american frontiersman of scottish ancestry and that of nastassja kinski who was supposed to be recently emigrated from england then the story started and it all went downhill fast motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context what there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officer pederast his accent was all over the map too i guess there weren t any english actors available lots of people left those who stayed tried to stifle giggles then openly guffawed i stuck it out i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good i was wrong inexplicably hudson chose to film them with hand held cameras not even steadicam the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel authenticity which ruined the sense of scale there was a semi famous tv reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me the late gary franklin of channel 7 eyewitness news i could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us and sure enough on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a 10 on his notorious franklin scale of 1 to 10 while remarking churlishly about the louts who d disrupted the screening the night before who clearly didn t know art when they saw it what a buffoon after this disaster pacino didn t star in another film for almost 4 years hugh hudson s career never recovered you can t say i didn t warn you 
__label__1 honestly i was expecting to hate this one and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace the group of post teens is warned by the property s caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid b movie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one by one first off there is plenty wrong with evil breed the acting dialog is pretty weak and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson chasey lain ginger lynn and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and jenna s role in this production is grossly over hyped as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time even less with chasey and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it s thrown in just to end the film those gripes aside there is some good stuff as well richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on with greico s nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey s guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn t shown on screen not bad for the first 5 minutes the other kill scenes are pretty inventive including jenna s forced breast implant removal a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass a knife through the face and a few other notables the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it s a shame the producers made them chop em so to speak also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don t really have too much time to be bored the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps overall evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected this one along with satan s little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films i usually steer clear of them as a whole but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith evil breed is no masterpiece but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you re at it i know i was and i m sure it didn t hurt the experience 7 5 10
__label__1 some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with a bit of aimee semple mcpherson the story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being hounded as they leave a courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters hand as they make their way to a waiting car soon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school the dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping out behaving like she s nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion listening on the radio to sister alma almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things i won t say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film in many ways this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straight jacket and the nanny while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year olds i ve ever seen plus she can really really dance my only concern about all this is that some might find winters hyper religiosity in the film a bit tacky like a cheap attack on christianity at first i felt that way but when you meet sister alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so i took winters religious zeal as just a sign of craziness which i assume is all that was intended by the way this film is packaged along with whoever slew auntie roo another shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great fun and quite over the top 
__label__0 i read tom robbins even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager i loved every word it was sexy funny and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing but when i saw the movie i could not believe what a dull sour joyless piece of junk it was how did this happen i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under gay pride women lesbians that s the library of congress subject heading now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians any more than star wars is about real space travel the book was obviously and i do mean obviously written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians in the nude all the time but has never really met one still someone in hollywood said uh oh better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble so they handed it to gus van sant nothing against the man but however gay he may really be he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film gus van sant took a straight man s playful fantasy of guilt free girl girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull literal minded lesbian power recruiting poster it s like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy not pretty the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting his clout allowed him to hire the very best his ignorance of the novel s real subtext a straight man s fantasy not a gay pride recruiting poster caused him to make choices that were not only bad but bizarre let s meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues pat morita as the chink okay there are few name recognition asian actors and pat morita in happy days was fairly funny but casting him as the chink was wrong wrong wrong pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man gus didn t tell him pat also doesn t seem to know that the chink is well sexy in the book he s not wise old mr miyagi he s more like hugh hefner he s a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean you see in the book they aren t really lesbians do you get that this is a straight man s fantasy yet john hurt as the countess okay he s a gay friendly man but he is a serious shakespearean actor you need someone who is fun and camp for this role for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more and sadly shake his head now richard you know you ve lost your soul entirely for shame my former student and yes john hurt was funny and pretty gay as caligula but that was black humor not playful and breezy humor like the book rain phoenix as bonanza jellybean no talent no training no problem except that in the book bonanza is funny playful cheerful mostly heterosexual and loving in the movie she s sullen passive expressionless and dull as for her taste for women robbins in the book puts it like this god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits uh gus did you read this book uma thurman as sissy hankshaw this is a tough role in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine still a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye or a sway in her walk to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures uma doesn t pull it off probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs uma plays it more like she s in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia this movie is sour and dull and i accuse you gus van sant 
__label__1 _les acteurs_ is the absurd story of jean pierre marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water the story of a conspiracy against actors the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting the fourth wall the hidden cameras to play or not to play the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera the film is not voyeur is quite vague and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing as andré dussolier quits the film and leaves josiane balasko to play his part great actress she s hilariously serious especially when in dussolier s role she bitches about herself as actors run in each other on the street asking for autographs as fights and gossip happen we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each or others have played actually for whoever does not know the actors most of them being at least in their 50s or does not know french cinema this movie has less interest since most of the references will be missed but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging on acting on public life

__label__1 this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you don t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn t close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future 
__label__0 the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i ve put the spoiler warning up because i m unsure if i m giving anything away the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago then we re up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house we re given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror some 105 year old woman lived there there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den an old fashioned straight razor falls out when they re renovating and the husband keeps it i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money the husband murders the body guard a co worker and steals the money his wife is suddenly pregnant what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron panels put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar was he locked down there by his family starved to death or just concealed who is mr hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels he s never seen again why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon spawn of the serial killer has he managed to infiltrate the husband s semen and why if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge burly security guard is he unable to overpower his wife and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldn t redeem this muddled incoherent mess 
__label__1 to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue that is not what this film is what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church although this could be substituted for any powerful body the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching if we do not study the past we are bound to repeat it 
__label__0 remember the name kevin lime and please please never lethim direct again timing pacing editing all hopelessly wrong three or four decent professionals next time guys walk off theset can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like aliceevans and the kind of production standards you d expect fromteen produced children s shows on british tv greatest mystery the music a score so inept inappropriate andill matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it isa case of sabotage add an acoustic that booms apparentlyunengineered from a single mike and a director who onlyintermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen and wehave what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result ofrecent years 
__label__1 for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film also the effects can be impressionable and awesome the plot is ridiculous and refreshing not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days also notable are the little aliens who i found cute all in all it s a good film for fans of the genre also recommended are films such as tetsuo the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed of course seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two 
__label__0 i m not even gonna waste time on this one it s not funny not scary practically unwatchable and only occassionaly gory the fx suck though no pun intended this is a disclaimer watch at your peril ask yourself 1 question are slugs scary 
__label__1 this film is fun if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then by no means is this movie fine cinema but if you dont take things too seriously and can laugh at yourself once in a while elvira is a good frownbuster 
__label__0 rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly griffin dunne rosanna arquette illeana douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john turturro all jumped on board only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke attaching martin scorsese s name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of it s parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing more than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull merk
__label__0 oh man if you want to give your internal crow t robot a real workout this is the movie to pop into the ol vcr the potential for cut up lines in this film is just endless minor spoilers ahead hey do you really care if a film of this quality is spoiled traci is a girl with a problem psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite sex parent but this girl seems to have one for her same sex one and i don t think there s a term for that it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette whose cute overbite neo flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters here dana is not only clueless to her daughter s conduct she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition it s possible that dana misses traci s murderous streak because truth be told traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster it s only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she s like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara carmen is so wise to traci s scheming she might also wear a sign saying hey i m the next victim sure enough traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire in another sequence arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard under cloudy skies talking to the owner cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies talking to the owner s brother then cut to her wearing the first dress in the first location under cloudy skies but it s supposed to be later you get the picture we re talking really bad directing as for skin don t expect much although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis for those looking for a trash wallow 8 for anybody else 1 2 
__label__1 to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn t go into theaters the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used there are a few dull moments when the story s following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get s the props it should the very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer the property he buy s turns out to be where the witch tooth fairy lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don t wanna give anything really away just a little info if you ve wanted to see this movie then do so it s worth the price of the rental
__label__1 robert culp they call his character doctor i think he s a vet or something and family move to an affluent low tax zero law enforcement suburb lantern jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and go cruising through his front yard at 60mph he presses charges which arouses the kids ire and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign marilyn manson er marlyn mason rather plays his fretful boiled celery wife who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services but the system is getting culp nowhere and he s not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music and we all know what movie people do when the system fails but this is based on a true story which makes it even better it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient 70s funk o matic teenage theme music that warns us when they re up to no good this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even handedly really it doesn t make a big generational thing out of it kudos for that anyway if you like dogs or at least believe in protecting their civil rights like me and you like justice and you like fire and you like justice for dogs by way of fire and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are too damn soft then this flick s ethos is up your alley no it s not really good at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word there s nothing subtle or understated or clever about it it s just sort of a feature length psa for vigilantism it does however capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works remember in frank miller s the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully s face in remember how cool that was or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors yeah mon unfortunately this was a 1973 made for tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate and it s probably not destined for dvd release but after being inspired by this film do you think i m gonna just sit here and take it 
__label__1 the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of symbolism the 2 goldfishes do they mean something in thai culture there s not much plot not much happens and it just meanders along no real start no real middle and no real end rather unsatisfying really it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real the move felt chaotic and disjointed i don t know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve maybe if i were thai it would make more sense 
__label__0 i rented this back in the 80 s and honestly can t remember anything specific about the movie only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen this isn t one of those it was so bad it was funny this isn t one of those it was so gory it leaves you with a bad feeling movies it wasn t even one of those what the heck was that movies i can t recall the performance of the actors but it was poorly shot the story was disjointed and it had no definable style when it was over i was angry that i had wasted the time i ve seen plenty of movies i didn t understand because of unfamiliar cultures styles and or story telling but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties the incubus has none i actually contemplated not making a comment on this piece for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie 
__label__1 i always thought this would be a long and boring talking heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads rituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider it s still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light shadow contrasts although there s hardly any action the ending is still shocking in it s ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit 
__label__1 yes as the other reviewers have already stated this may not be vintage l h but it s far from being their worst work as at 20th century stupid i mean fox this film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys but it s their serious approach and determination that makes them funny they don t play it for laughs as other comedians might but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor in this film they are faced with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today namely job related stress first we would get checked out by a doctor and he would prescribe some much needed rest and perhaps staying by the sea that s where the surrealness comes in to all of this l h always take a most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerate it but never to the point of being incredible except maybe once in awhile this makes us laugh because we can relate to their self caused predicaments and attempts at extrication that s what makes stan and ollie universal in their appeal in this film all those ingredients are presented in a delightfully artful and gracefully slapstick way not their best in comparison to their earlier work probably because this was the actual last film they did for roach because he wanted to mirror the big studios and go into making features exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligation big mistake they should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five more years what the world may have missed in their not considering this as an option watch laugh and enjoy this as their last great performance

__label__1 joseph h lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir this is surely his best it doesn t have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir though american made it is set entirely in england it lacks gangsters it lacks a femme fatale it does not lack crime the title character answers an ad she is overjoyed that she ll be making some money as a secretary instead she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms foch has an elegant manner she is no screaming cowering victim she is actually a bit icy and patrician albeit impecunious this makes her character s plight all the more believable surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty she was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady vanishes she has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly dithering manner but here she is far from a heroine george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son the whole cast in fact is superb it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing but he did it on a low budget that is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir it is small convincingly lowlife and in this case unforgettable 
__label__1 a brother s promise is a wonderful family film this is a biography of dan jansen a champion olympic speed skater the movie depicts this athlete s life from a young age through full adulthood the love and support of the family members is evident throughout how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us the commitment and determination of dan s coach and his teammates shows what it takes to make a real team how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age 
__label__1 the scots excel at storytelling the traditional sort many years after the event i can still see in my mind s eye an elderly lady my friend s mother retelling the battle of culloden she makes the characters come alive her passion is that of an eye witness one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldn t guess from the way she tells it the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig a local cut in to give his version the discussion continued to closing time stories passed down like this become part of our being who doesn t remember the stories our parents told us when we were children they become our invisible world and as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir fact and fiction blend with aspiration role models warning stories archetypes magic and mystery my name is aonghas like my grandfather and his grandfather before him our protagonist introduces himself to us and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations it produces stories within stories stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland its rugged mountains shrouded in mists the stuff of legend yet seach d is rooted in reality this is what gives it its special charm it has a rough beauty and authenticity tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hear aonghas angus visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death he burns with frustration part of him yearns to be in the twenty first century to hang out in glasgow but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelic speaking community yet there is a deeper conflict within him he yearns to know the truth the truth behind his grandfather s ancient stories where does fiction end and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents he is pulled to make a last fateful journey to the summit of one of scotland s most inaccessible mountains can the truth be told or is it all in stories in this story about stories we revisit bloody battles poisoned lovers the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth in doing so we each connect with angus as he lives the story of his own life seachd the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made like angus i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories but also like angus i forgave this once i saw the bigger picture forget the box office pastiche of braveheart and its like you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man to see a film that is true to scotland this one is probably unique if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough you might even re evaluate the power of storytelling and the age old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced 
__label__0 i am an avid fan of lucio fulci and yet i must say that zombi 3 aka zombie flesh eaters 2 of 1988 which he made with two other directors bruno mattei and claudi fragasso was quite a disappointment especially compared to its great predecessor fulci s very own gore classic zombi 2 aka zombie felsh eaters zombie of 1979 this is vastly disappointing sure the low rating of 4 5 already suggests that it s not a good film but these low ratings usually come from people who are not into italian zombie flicks and as enthusiastic fan of italian horror films and low budget exploitation cinema i love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings also many of my fellow italian horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated which i sadly cannot agree with not that the film was a complete disaster it has some redeeming qualities above all fulci s nauseating gore effects that are always a pleasure to watch for an italian horror gore buff the basic idea behind the film is also not bad allthough far from original and i liked the ruthless portrayal of the military sadly that s about it while the great predecessor zombi 2 was extremely gory but beyond that also genuinely creepy this is not creepy or scary for a minute and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch zombi 3 the film is sometimes fun to watch but only for the gore and as an unintentional comedy i guess that it was mainly the gore that came from fulci and the disappointing rest that came from mattei and fragasso the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cult flicks such as d amato s porno holocaust and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made the god awful troll 2 overall this is definitely watchable for the gore but out of all fulci films i ve seen so far this is definitely the worst and i ve seen the majority of this great filmmaker s repertoire i am a fulci fan and i always will be but this sure isn t his magic moment it may be fun for the gore but i recommend to watch any other fulci film before this 
__label__1 i think that people are under estimating this incredible film people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1 10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10 10 for the pure entertainment of the film the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining 
__label__1 as far as the muppet line goes however this is not the best nor the second best this was marketed towards the kiddies but has some dark and emotionally upsetting adult moments to which parents may not wish to expose their children one of which showcases miss piggy going postal in a jealous rage which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work beyond that however the story is progressive and highly entertaining one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun i like this very much and enjoy it still today it rates a 7 6 10 from the fiend 
__label__1 this first rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement romance and james stewart to the screen the far country is the only one out of all five stewart mann westerns that is often overlooked stewart yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he had in the five stewart mann westerns jeff webster stewart is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without this displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick ben tatum played by walter brennan since tatum is the one that gave it to him mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart mann westerns he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners calvet and flippen and no good but beautiful roman and her hired men they are unable to leave because crooked sheriff mr gannon mcintire and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through skagway which is gannon s town but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart and or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government what is mcintire there for he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money people are killed a sheriff for dawson is considered needed and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed so flippen is elected instead a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon s men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named madden who carries two guns played by wilke flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk a man named yukon replaces flippen stewart and tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by gannon s men tatum is killed and stewart is wounded stewart finally realizes that he must do something or gannon will take over dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like skagway the audience also realizes what stewart must do another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly this is where a great scene occurs stewart walks into his cabin he has a sling on his arm for a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up stewart is in the background just inside the door he stares at it for a few seconds he tosses the sling away the sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor this is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself he comes into his new life of helping people when they need help what ends the film is a guns blazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feel good feeling that everything will be alright 
__label__1 i saw this movie when i was about 8 years old and i liked it but it wasn t until i watched it again at the age of 13 that i really understood it for what it is a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold adopts a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals the dog star charlie b barkin is murdered by his formal business partner carface who is absolutely diabolical by the way his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life s time which charlie being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds sending him back to earth once back on earth charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface this is how he comes upon young anne marie the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface but scoundrel charlie actually comes to care for young anne marie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after anne marie discovers what her best friend charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino now he must rescue her from the dreaded carface i still love this movie even at the age of 22 the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain 
__label__0 horrible acting horrible cast and cheap props would ve been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie what a waste starting from the name of the movie the enemy naming it action movie would ve made it better contributing to the parody effect the cop looking like a 60 year old player the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie horrible don t waste your time 
__label__0 i may not have the longest of attention spans but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through and i even bought it on dvd because of its classic status at first i thought that the director was playing a big joke so i kept waiting for a resolution something to laugh at something to keep my interest but this resolution never came rather the writing was laughably amateurish the movie dragged on and felt disjointed like someone cut a tv series to feature length the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight oscars once again i repeat myself this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through the first was exterminator i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is 1 10
__label__0 i rented this movie from the library it s hard to find for good reason purely out of curiosity i m a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment the bell jar 1979 is by far one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the script is horrible not because it strays from the original novel text but because it strays without focus or intent the scenes are ill constructed and don t lead the viewer anywhere what s with the hokey voice over of plath s poetry lady lazarus has little do with greenwood s situation plath s poetry was completely misused marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood or any 20 year old for that matter partly due to casting she was 32 during filming the age plath was when she died and partly due to the fact that she can t act hassett is all emotion no craft no skill the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what s there which isn t much the only reason i m giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn t an option sorry sylvia you ll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting 
__label__1 this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey one sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that history repeats itself life is what it is shown in the movie when people are young they seem not to understand their parents their own spouses people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves so that when life has to end some day people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope a new life the actors and actresses are fantastic they have understood the director s intention perfectly the movie s charm lies in to me the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience 
__label__1 this was a great romantic comedy historically inaccurate einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb but he made a great matchmaker he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working the supporting cast lou jacobi joseph maher gene saks stephen fry etc all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around and did he wear socks in one scene reportedly the professor never wore socks two new entries for the imdb goofs section historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside this was a great movie to watch with a great cast i give it an 8 
__label__0 for some reason tv guide gave this two and a half stars plus faye dunaway is in it so it definitely looked like something to see my oh my this may be the worst film i ve ever seen ever from its horrid acting every time the girl asks the boy what s wrong with him i shouted to the tv i can t act when she asks what he needs i yell i need acting lessons to the unbelievably bad dialog give me back my organs and the brian depalma wannabe ending too it was all just beyond awful i wanted to like it dunaway is one of the best actors ever and the production values were pretty good but wowzers this had me laughing laughing most of the time don t even bother out of curiosity that was my first mistake staying with it was definitely my second and third and fourth 
__label__0 this is by far the worst horror thriller i ve seen in my 29 years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isn t even the worst part of this movie its the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killer s capture but i ve seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this 
__label__1 at least for a half hour a week i haven t been interested in anything on the big 3 networks abc cbs nbc in years all of the lions are interesting although larry can get annoying at times i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter most of the other characters are interesting as well the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times too the animation is top notch and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show usually when they hire big names to star in a show they re trying to hide a poor script or characters not entirely true in this show though there s a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting but overall the characters stand on their own this is definitely for 16 and up there s nothing here that most kids haven t already heard before though and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads it s definitely not as crude and edgy as south park but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs pinky and the brain and freakazoid it s the same type of humor grown up it may not be as witty as spielberg s classic tv series but it s still good i hope that it finishes this season off well and is renewed for future seasons otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again 
__label__0 the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous the plot is awful but on the plus side the acting is pretty good with a few good shouts and rants sharon stone is ok this time not even half as good as the original mind you the murders aren t as gory as the first one either which is a shame its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake they are fully clothed the script is weak most of the time but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr glass and washburn are highlights the plot twists a few times but the ending is awful the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of oh my god the chase sequences are brilliantly directed and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise rush felt film sharon stone is a bit old for this too the bits where we see her breasts were in the first one delights this time around they are too horrid to describe the films its self is rather average but it is worth a go mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz with the opening sequence being a highlight not to be critical but if you liked the first one leave this one don t ruin the run you ll be glad you left this stone unturned 
__label__1 here s my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all encompassing con it s like the grifters but without that film s level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouse s lines the way she reads them sound as if they re inner monologue or narration which they aren t with the arrival of mantegna things pick up the dialogue here isn t as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring a ding ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones don t it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words he s far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality what s more strange is that other than this the film doesn t look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowed i wouldn t mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines it s a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn t work that doesn t mean the movie is bad it isn t it s often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middle it s standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is she s a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room i ll admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting she d write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end however and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones the little learner ones to be the most fun we re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is we see the ending coming and then we didn t see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didn t see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling i m going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again james foley did him better 
__label__1 what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme the summary from taxman is great i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing i must have been 10 11 at the time i watched it i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead s very blond hair and his permanently sad state the theme was played on a flute i recall although i cannot remember how it went i think the intro showed him playing it or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune but at least i now know it is not just me 
__label__0 yeti curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas unlucky really with some dead some alive the survivors have to think about themselves decide to wait it out until help comes however just when they think their luck couldn t get any worse they soon discover that a huge hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill eat them all trapped cold starving fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time yeah with a title like yeti curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing that is that someone at the sci fi channel has made yet another creature feature although to give these things a bit of variety the sci fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a beast feast as if that will make any difference directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time sure it s bad but it s sort of fun at times too the basic premise is alright actually it s a sort of cross between alive 1993 with it s plane crash the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive the excellent gory killer bigfoot another legendary hairy monster exploitation flick night of the demon 1980 which i would defend with my last breath i have to say it s not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it s fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written the character s are mostly annoying american teens there s the expected arguing there s the macho hero the strong female the coward who thinks only of himself so there s no prizes for originality there are some plot holes too if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them how are you going to dig a large hole line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her the there are actually two yeti s running around twist isn t used to any effect at all either at least there s a good pace about the film it certainly moves along at a fair old pace i never found myself becoming bored with it there s some moderately gory action the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not if they are going to eat their dead mates or not the one thing you can always say about these sci fi channel creature features or beast feasts is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious so that proves to be the case yet again the plane crash at the start looks awful the yeti when it s cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it s on a pogo stick there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm a squashed head a ripped out heart some dead bodies some blood splatter the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half beats him with his own ripped off legs before biting a big chunk out of them according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three a half hours to get into the suit the make up which seems like a long time since it s actually a pretty tatty looking creation apparently the original title was raksha curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit so now you know this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh bleak himalayas was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm the acting isn t that good i didn t think any of the girls looked that good either which didn t help yeti curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc fi channel creature feature if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn t too bad there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it s not very good 
__label__0 the original les visiteurs was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect lv2 must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in lv2 everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn t work first it s repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved lv1 just don t see this film just see lv1 again

__label__0 an excellent performance by alix elias highlights an otherwise mis directed and confused pile of dreck i have seen this movie perhaps 12 times and with each run through i find less and less pleasure why are munchies so lustful is that ever explained are they a reflection of our wanton boorish animal selves if they are why not make it more obvious why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie and make that connection explicit another part of this movie that bothers me to no end motorcycles the jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest street wise traveler the sun glasses say pretty cool dude with all this i m ready for easy rider meets the muppets all i get is munchies 1987 what gives stick to the gremlins series if you re a fan of diminutive wise cracking reptile puppets it ll give you the treatment you deserve 
__label__1 the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can t drive and he wants to make the rip by himself the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role at first i felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone 
__label__0 never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent let s see first they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread next they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget and finally when the film hits the theaters get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the multiplexes if necessary not on the merits of the film itself but because a 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory but that of course won t be enough i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti christian of course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn t surprise anyone it is after all good old fashioned capitalism at work what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole left behind mindset as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality it leaves me scratching my head it would appear that there are many many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air what kind of reality i wonder are these people living in is this rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they fervently want to believe in and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and disillusioned will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the rapture is imminent in a way i almost wish that such an event would occur what an interesting day that would be what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the anthropological sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed but as more of a stephen spielberg production with boiling clouds trumpets angels descending out of the sky moon turned to blood the whole nine yards imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the evangelists had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit wouldn t that be something yet in the final analysis it s that cold hard physical reality that i will content myself with my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently thank you very much 
__label__1 when it first came out this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinema really at first we must say that this isn t really direct cinema it is more cinema verité the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation the meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality these two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they can t help talking to each other this way they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need in the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply edie says she doesn t want her mother to die because she loves her very much and edith says that she doesn t want edie to leave her because she doesn t want to be alone but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women can t help be girls they cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the meysels and few others could do 
__label__1 return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the western s clint eastwood digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old days this film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era act one sets up the premise workers in a dye mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters they can t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like mr miyagi s style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad nausem in hollywood flicks they sure don t make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday so if you re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for 
__label__1 i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting best of all it left out the usual sex and violence they re getting old inserted in many movies the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the southwest the acting was also superb

__label__1 todd rohal is a mad genius knuckleface jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads what the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration or not you just have to see for yourself the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can you ll be glad you did it is hilarious and check out todd s other short films also popping up here and there from time to time single spaced and slug 660 
__label__1 who would ve imagined hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style the fusion is highly entertaining having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade i approached this one with some caution his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog the director s earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life often in the region of long island new york or in new york city itself that were offbeat and insightful my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a spy thriller to my pleasant surprise hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue it works in more ways than one might imagine hartley s film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks along with a singular cinematographic style moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides hartley has brought all his skills to something new a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana truly he is coming into his own the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley s vision and style fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before

__label__1 the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good but still not work if the audience doesn t believe that the actor is portraying the person that s the main issue with young mr lincoln henry fonda gives a terrific performance but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft spoken as fonda portrays him this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront whether or not this was a true story i don t know but if it isn t then why tell it using lincoln as the central character never mind though in the film lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder there s really not much to the film and as a result it seems rather empty i wanted more story and character development the film is 100 minutes long but it doesn t feel like it there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd but they seem superficial the acting is good all around but as i said fonda s performance works as a character but not abraham lincoln i just don t believe that the real lincoln was that soft spoken true he has a big voice when he needs to such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly the other performances are solid though especially alice brady as abigail clay the mother of the accused she s a nice lady who we can really feel for simple and uneducated yet very sweet we can see why lincoln wanted to help her john ford seems to think of this film as an epic and at the time of its release it probably was but even then there s just not enough material to present it as such it s a nice watch but not a classic 
__label__1 despite its low key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries the r rating in the states can t have helped honestly just because hbc uses the c word this is actually a fine piece of work the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but it s overcome by the playing of the two leads it s easy to win plaudits just because you re playing a physical or mental cripple daniel day lewis geoffrey rush dustin hoffman etc and helena bonham carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely in fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes and what eyes this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film except possibly hamlet and there his playing was diluted by the large cast here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a self loathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn t always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth in short we believe him just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein as the priest in the proposition as the lawyer in the gingerbread man even as andrew in peter s friends this is surely his finest performance yet so why could he not produce the goods much earlier as a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldn t amount to very much but it s been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and i eagerly await more from them though not love s labour s lost 8 out of 10 but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10 
__label__0 this movie was awful in the worst way you just didn t care you didn t care what happened in the plot you didn t care about the characters everyone was devoid of heart i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didn t want to subject my mind to it any more there is far too much sex in the film sex can be okay it can even make the movie hence karma sutra but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy it was just ugly don t see this film 
__label__0 it does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and small groups of scientists that gathered this data what s up with all the al gore biography going on there like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone layer i ve seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really don t understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless you ve been living under a rock this documentary shouldn t be any news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points p s i m not american so don t even try saying that i m a bush fan p
__label__0 i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2 00 a m so i flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon h b o where this classic was playing initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle s diner and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting but certainly not worth watching basically if you have nothing to do some night or just can t sleep medication works much better however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound but even that can get annoying
__label__1 i loved this mini series tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham a beautiful young woman hiding along with her young son from a mysterious past as an anglophile who loves romances this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the 1800 s i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production 
__label__0 i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week this is a real problem that far too many afican american families have dealt with and continue to deal with the lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study law enforcement including local state and federal are also complicit what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending seemingly television can deal with almost any subject matter except race this is shameful get it together or don t explore it next time 
__label__0  however i am not one of them caro diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time but the boring and self centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self indulgent mess moretti says he feels a need to make this movie but doesn t want to whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it but really doesn t want to either a film about italian politics and elections could be fascinating but this is not that film at one point moretti and his friends are standing outside the communist party headquarters discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside but it s characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them interposed with moretti s political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant pietro the film drags us through several years and more than one election period we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument but they never come i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a nanni moretti movie again he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity 
__label__1 a blockbuster at the time of it s original release it was the second highest grossing film of 1976 the third screen version of a star is born has always divided critics and fans alike the film open to scathingly negative reviews however 5 6 million budgeted picture went on to gross over 150 million at the box office and won an academy award and five golden globes it s not without some irony that streisand s most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial for every ten fans who state that star is streisand s best film there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography although both sides have some merit to support their claims it should still be noted that the seventies take on a star is born remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that hollywood ever produced for my money it s the best version of the often told tale the film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing changing the setting from the old hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters romance and their careers this is the main area that the 1976 version of a star is born actually surpasses it s classic predecessors for example the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never ending phone calls that interrupt kristofferson s songwriting attempts this version of the story is also more believable in it s portrayal of the lead characters for example the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self sacrificing that they came off as saints on the other hand esther the female lead in this version is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate but also flawed and conflicted this makes her feel more real than the janet gaynor or judy garland characters felt in the previous films and makes the story that much more effective the performances are all on target even if some of the supporting characters aren t fleshed out enough if you re looking for an actress singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance streisand is definitely the girl you want she s one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural and as usual she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer simply put her esther is a fully realized three dimensional human being kris kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid back characterization however he s always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from newsweek time and even the new yorker s usually vicious pauline kael gary busey and paul mazursky also give believable performances but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time the film s soundtrack recording was also a massive success hitting the 1 on billboard s hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the us alone the streisand composed evergreen with lyrics from paul williams is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop brought to even further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from streisand the rest of the film s original songs mostly composed by williams and rupert holmes are pretty good as well and streisand sounds fantastic her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded streisand s vibrant performances bring woman in the moon and with one more look at you to thrilling life and make even sillier numbers like queen bee work far better than they have the right to kristofferson s solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless however that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline though naturally dated in some respects it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made the seventies take on a star is born still holds up remarkably well the film is well mounted and slickly produced the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine and streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective in conclusion a star is born is not only entertaining and moving but it also transcends all criticism 
__label__1 documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold balls that s where they dress up however they like strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other as one man says to another you have three strikes against you you re black gay and a drag queen these are people who sadly are not accepted in society only at the balls there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted then the film cuts to three years later 1989 and you see how things have changed tragically for some sounds depressing but it s not most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations they re well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor just as they should we find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out the sense of community in this film is fascinating when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial and a big hit it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals but was never even nominated for an academy award their reason was black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material fascinating isn t it homophobia and racism all together seen today it s still a great film and a period piece it just isn t like that anymore the ny they show no longer exists the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here also drag has become more accepted in society for better or worse and i ve heard the houses are gone too that s kind of sad i would like to know where these characters are now i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown still it a one of a kind documentary fascinating funny and riveting a must see all the way a definite 10 where s the dvd 
__label__1 man on fire is definitely one of the best drama crime thrillers i have ever seen despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well this is denzel washington s perfect role in which he plays a body guard called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée pita dakota fanning plays pita the very smart enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner she has a great future ahead of her as i said the story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it you must watch it a couple of times this film is made in two parts there s the first hour where everyone is happy nothing s wrong everyone s just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed and then there s the second part the rest of the film where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing when creasy s recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and la hermamdad that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them it is a real shame that this film hasn t been acknowledged enough washington really deserved another oscar for his performance and so did fanning and the director and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality if you like excellent slightly deranged suspenseful thrillers this is the one to see the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters 10 10
__label__0 underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan drifting on the sumida rehearsing and acting in the nakamura za were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck 
__label__1 i keep watching this movie over and over and over i have to watch it at least once a week i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn t even know about africa denzel s movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life i wish he was my own brother i have also seen and love your masala mississipi what a thrilling situation when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn t know then that denzel was american till i moved down here 
__label__0 the show s echoed bubbling sound effect used to put me to sleep a very soothing show i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs florida i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge of the seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother s house imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads i thought flipper had better undersea action of course he had the advantage of being in his natural environment 
__label__1 warning mild spoilers the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing even moving episode in american history and world religious history this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth i ve so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers alvin hyrum joseph who at a very young age needed an operation the operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents joseph s religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed the face of jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph s marriage to emma this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history but merely jumps from scene to scene this is not a critique simply a note about the style the practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior s love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the ever deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments the film shows many scenes from joseph s life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph s life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful at the end the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non members i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movie can do just that as an insider i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an american religious man or something else the film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law we moderns take for granted 
__label__1 i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft core porn in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks perhaps for sex as well but not on indian tv anyway not being a fan of the genre i couldn t place jeff wincott and had no leads to search from only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic nurse coif so mayoral for the high top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90 s couture or nod and wink schlock à la paul verhoeven can we add a genre tag for so bad it s good 
__label__0 i thought i read somewhere that this was the last monogram production but whether that s true or not it doesn t matter because if it wasn t then it should have been it s a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice robert shayne in bringing the dead back to life every time their subjects are revived they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table big deal carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it s dead and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion wooooooooohhhh that s about all she wrote for an ultra cheap monogram quickie this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted the funniest running joke in the movie is that the older doctor carradine constantly refers to his young assistant shayne as m boy when in fact carradine was actually 40 and shayne was 45 when they made this 
__label__0 i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg over acted crap don t send an assassin it s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it s good it s so bad i d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it s that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i m sorry i don t get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung s cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance 12 monkeys clerks etc there s no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo i ve said enough here 
__label__1 at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing i m kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with shaun of the dead now given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius i realise this is a rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether fido will appeal to you in a way the comedy picks up where shaun left off except we re back in the original 1950s living dead era stereotypical middle american small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well adjusted useful members of the community this so we re informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps the beauty of the film lies in its dead pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual it s a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film s all round strong cast it s one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part it s also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like so in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you 
__label__0 i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb but i went to see it anyway because i am a big fan of bible related material first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie but it also looked like casper van dien didn t see those jones movies through but he should i believe he tried his best but script just stunk music tried to be kinda jones style too great work but for such movie it seemed like too much work like the video part did t deserve all that great music robert wagner gave his best acting skills he did a good job but somehow the script was bringing everything down jokes are old school somewhere 20 years old they brought only cynic smile to my face there are some really bad camera angels sfx looks like homemade and unrealistic kevin vanhook had probably a good idea on the story in my opinion but i love such stories but things just didn t work out in the end maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head when i in first minutes saw that movie was going to be one of those low budget movies i hoped that i will at least hear a good story but sometimes movies just disappoint 
__label__0 very disappointing film by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part and william macy was good as always still not worth watching it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep 
__label__0 hi everyone if you saw singing in the rain you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain you also remember the dance number of donald o connor make em laugh if you saw royal wedding you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling if you saw jailhouse rock you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself that is what is missing here there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation the closest was chuck mcgowan s i can do that the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film richard attenborough was to blame for this failure he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at it does not work here the cast was good except for michael of course a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production but someone should have thought about how to film it next time they do one of these i hope they call me first tom willett
__label__1 rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre sergio martino fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film it s when everything has fallen into place that we can go ahh the film revolves around the death of a husband in an airplane explosion and the million dollars the wife receives from it there are those with great interest in that money one in particular being the dead man s mistress the wife is lisa ida galli and the mistress demanding half the money is lara janine reynaud she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money lara says she ll use her lawyer sharif luis barboo to get that money so already the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa who awaiting someone in tokyo george hilton portrays peter lynch peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means when on his watch lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room he is a possible suspect he decides to do a little investigating himself while also assisting inspector stavros luigi pistilli and interpol agent benton tom felleghy on their quest to find a killer the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa soon the film follows a journalist cléo dupont the delicious luscious anita strindberg as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her soon they fall deeply in love but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed soon someone attacks cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken the throat and lower torso the film s conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying the film has some unique camera angles but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery 
__label__0 avoid the usa version it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you ve ever heard probably done by new york amateurs the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater 3000 i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba s voice i couldn t watch the entire film it was that bad instead of this americanized version watch chiba s other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors 
__label__1 i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy adventure quest of some sort the plot line really is nothing like i have seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters in spite of what first impressions may give it isn t cheesy corny tacky or ridiculous and is actually highly entertaining and funny the flow is quite well done nothing seems rushed or dragged out the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv and even though i might have known what was coming at points i still couldn t bear to stop watching the screen to my knowledge not a single person left the theater during the entire movie my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film and as brilliant as it is i can t figure out why 
__label__0 the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 nov 1918 the troops pile off the train wearing the uniform in which the french army including the legion marched off to war in 1914 this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey the french army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working metropolitan french troops were put into horizon blue and colonial troops were put into khaki the claude van damme sp remake at least got the uniforms more or less right really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right 
__label__0 this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it s watchable and rather funny i don t think the film makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it s just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it s the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it s own this film is really stupid but it s funny the killings are hilarious i wouldn t advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked good but if it happens to be on tv one night and you re up for a laugh then stick it on 
__label__0 the only reason i don t give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isn t quite on par with a movie like manos the hands of fate this movie s greatest crime is the fact that it is head meltingly boring terribly unforgivably british the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising the whole teleporting concept but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting it was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers the actors were wooden unemotional and aloof as was the love affair between the two scientists which was anything but intriguing i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non existent nor did i really understand why the melty faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research grants else they go rampaging about killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures 
__label__1 but just as entertaining and random love it or hate it but don t expect a sophisticated plot or nail biting cliffhanger think of it like seinfeld but without the follow through and repeat performances of wacky characters well so far i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season continues creature comforts is not for the faint of humour it s meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your brain s part which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what i m missing funnier than most of today s sitcoms calmer than an evening at nascar just the right mix of dead air and comebacks can t wait for the next one 
__label__0 warning spoiler i have to agree with you it was almost there this was such a bad movie about such and interesting true story it had such promise but the acting was ridiculous at best some sets were beautiful and realistic others are something out of a theme park i found myself laughing as i watched what was suppose to be serious scenes i really wanted to like this movie but i couldn t the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the king dying i liked the queens punishment and the final shot made a beautiful picture though there are so many better movies to watch i don t recommend this 
__label__0 first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg burt reynolds is not boss hogg and even worse was m c gainey as roscoe if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this movie the movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop but goes on to win the race 
__label__0 first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus single parent troubles and it s so predictable that you can practically recite along with it second of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close minded in fact i don t recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptight so classical it s really insulting how label classical music in this way third i ve went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isn t any point at all and oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly i m not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasn t as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time 1 10 stars 
__label__0 that word true in this film s title got my alarm bells ringing they rang louder when a title card referred to america s civil war as the war between the states the circumlocution preferred by die hard southerners jesse james thief slave holder and murderer is described as a quiet gentle farm boy how dishonest is this movie there is no mention of slavery far less of the documented fact that jesse james s poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war and that jesse and his brother frank actively fought to preserve slavery according to this movie all those civil war soldiers were really fighting to decide whether missouri is a northern state or a southern state that s all missouri it s a candy mint it s a breath mint black people are entirely absent from this movie except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars one of whom wears a help the poor sign that s very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten some shots of 19th century newspapers are inaccurate too with 20th century type fonts this film has a weird flashback structure there s some very impressive stunt riding and some fine work by stunt horses and one excellent montage i savoured one line of dialogue some of those boys will never taste beans again the movie gets a few facts straight agnes moorehead as jesse s mother conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of pinkerton here called remington in which jesse james s real life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm some errors here are pardonable during his bushwhacking days the real jesse james accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger but robert wagner in the title role here does not have a stumpfinger i ve seen a photo of jesse james s real wife if she had looked half as glamorous as hope lange looks in this movie jesse james might have stayed home more there s plenty of revisionism here and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles but many of this movie s errors were avoidable jesse james s mentor william quantrill is mentioned several times but all the actors mispronounce his name we see jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two storey house where he will soon die after paying a rent of 18 actually jesse james s last residence at 1318 lafayette street st joseph missouri was a simple one storey cottage renting for 14 there was no upper storey so when jesse james is killed his wife could not come running from upstairs as hope lange does here she was actually in the kitchen one continuity error robert wagner with no stunt double does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back but when he gets up the rope binding his wrists has vanished the screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates following the northfield robbery attempt jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday the actual northfield bank raid by the james gang 7 september 1876 was two days after jesse james s birthday maybe he meant next year s birthday later we see jesse and his wife moving into their st joseph home on a fine summer day while jesse tells her what he plans to do when christmas eve arrives but in real life mr and mrs jesse james moved into that house on 24 december 1881 so this scene should be on christmas eve these errors were entirely avoidable some of the fictionalisations here don t make sense according to this movie the northfield bank raid failed because one fictional henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires if this had actually happened it would indeed have hampered the james gang s getaway but it wouldn t have affected the robbery itself which failed for other reasons there are good performances here by jeffrey hunter as frank james moorehead alan hale jnr as cole younger and by stage actress marian seldes in a rare screen role i was disappointed by robert wagner normally an under rated actor elsewhere wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes villains and morally ambiguous characters here he can t seem to decide whether to depict jesse james as a goodie or a baddie so he doesn t much bother john carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises jesse and his wife at their wedding in fact jesse james was baptised in childhood by his uncle a methodist minister but perhaps this second baptism is a topping up jesse james was no robin hood i doubt that robin hood was robin hood either but that s another story there is not one single documented instance of jesse james ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family after some of his hold ups he didn t even split the swag with the rest of his gang in this movie jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever in reality the night before his death jesse james and the ford brothers stole horses that jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the platte city bank as preparation for most of his robberies jesse james stole horses from local farmers the same poor folk who in the inaccurate legends were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse i cringed at one scene here in which the fictional jesse james is so gol durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes the true not much story of jesse james is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer and likewise dishonest about the civil war for the very impressive stunt work one good montage and a few fine acting turns i ll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10 
__label__1 i want céline and jessie go further in their relationship i want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached this is about love but not stupid things like in notting hills or those kind of movie this is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling this was so clever and touching i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there i want to go to vienna i want to see them as soon as possible again i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happen i m french and didn t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski three colors white now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting i saw before sunset the sequel in paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter they are both masterpieces proof that you don t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings i m sorry for my english which i m trying to best franck in france
__label__1 i started watching the apprentice about 4 years ago maybe 5 and i really really liked it the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core is still very entertaining donald trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well but the best part of the show is new york city mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character unto itself the jazz tunes coupled with some great camera work make new york look spectacular the apprentice will easily alway make my top 3 reality shows of all time the amazing race is no 1 however but just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast the same case as with tar star world the broadcasters in this country did a bang up job in presenting the show the first three seasons were shown in a row then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown which kept the concept fresh in conclusion you will love this show especially the first 2 seasons however if you keep watching the show continuously thereafter its charm will wear off and fast 
__label__1 this film is one of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930 s before the hoyts code was enforced it s the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns lily powers is a woman who doesn t have love on her mind just power and money i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain the filming and different scenes were something fantastic the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks making this film full of realism this film was all together an alright movie the ending to this movie wasn t as good as it should have been but it didn t entirely ruin it baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once and suggested to some people and friends 
__label__1 this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living some of the scenes are very funny i don t think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in color the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it 
__label__0 this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen and i don t mean that in a good way we wanted to see a crappy horror thriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store for once the film was everything we d expected and more or should i say less the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera the so called special effects are created by putting red see through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats and the script don t even get me started on the script and just when you thought it couldn t get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar material compared to the ending take it from me this film is hilarious if you re into crappy horror films but if you want a good film keep on looking this is not for you 
__label__0 this movie was horrible i swear they didn t even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie ice t was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when ice t is on that hill and uses that spaz 15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take 1000 s of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didn t see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldn t blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel 
__label__1 marie you are smooth dan no i m not smooth i m dan if you re anything like me smooth and single do not go together you see someone you like rare enough as that can be and you want to say something but you don t or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you ve ever said in your life more often then not though you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life a risk you can t blame a guy for being a little frightened though maybe he s been burned hard before or maybe he s trying to focus all his energy on his career there are reasons some valid some not and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason you tell yourself you don t need it or it isn t the right time for you but you still wish it were happening any way you break it down it s not easy sound familiar if you thought yes even just a little then dan in real life the new comedy from director peter hedges is a must see it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once the dan from the title is dan burns steve carell an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced fulfilling and morally uplifting life four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day he lost his wife and love of his life after that tragedy dan was left to raise their three daughters alone between that and focusing on his career finding love again was not one of dan s priorities and so he became more functional than feeling removed from the power of intimacy dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again that is until he meets marie juliette binoche in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning they re interaction is casual comfortable and it catches both of them off guard there is only one problem really she is already seeing someone unfortunately for all involved that someone is dan s brother mitch dane cook his entire family has come up to their parents country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan s heart from its coma with so many family members to deal with jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film luckily hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes despite the occasional evan almighty sized misstep he is charismatic charming and obviously a sharp humorist as dan he is also self deprecating awkward and scared carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona perhaps more importantly he is entirely relatable as dan whether he s flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen unable to stan d still in his anxiety dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did despite its slight shortcomings juliette binoche i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i don t recommend it unless there is chocolate involved because of where i am in my life would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film i can t say what i can say as someone who knows what it means to be lonely dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen 
__label__1 this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the screenwriting department more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting location work and overall exuberance the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian the third with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isn t helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he s obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we re given a woman with a jaw of a turtle minor quibbles aside this movie and it s wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can 
__label__1 i don t know why i picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different every once in a while its good to try a film that s slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero thriller flick and this film certainly was different right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn t figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being and are left with the things are going to be ok type of a feeling i m sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance 
__label__1 once you can get past the film s title pecker is a great film perhaps one of john waters best a wonderful cast headed by strong performances by edward furlong and christina ricci make the story very funny and very real there are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children but they are there for a purpose unfortunately this movie was not mass produced and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it if the opportunity knocks then go see this film 
__label__1 for me this movie was powerful i don t want to be a spoiler but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers this movie brought back some vivid memories for some reason i couldn t place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 i kept getting a message like no votes have been placed and yet i saw in the stats that there were will try again tomorrow monday minor flaws i overlooked it was the relationships between the characters that got me beautifully acted and real situations i ve been in a couple of them a small gem of a movie just like spring forward is another overlooked gem i m very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people well written sensitively unfolded with first class acting and direction after all isn t that what it s all about 
__label__0 very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading man pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has is its quirky side characters but without a realistic backdrop such characters are pointless nothing to see here keep moving 
__label__0 the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although turturro is an actor i generally like his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi autistic man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances 
__label__0  iowa wants to be requiem for a dream for midwest meth but it comes across as a hard r rated reefer madness yes drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious as an addiction and how it destroys people families and communities but these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye rolling plot won t teach that lesson to anyone while writer director star matt farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner diane foster plays a wincibly silly wide eyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by susan sarandon in the rocky horror picture show i really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through it wasn t until the end of the film that i realized i was supposed to think these two were recent high school graduates to explain some of their naiveté as we are bombarded by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on the o c while they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a badlands type couple the guest stars are badly used michael t weiss who was so good in tv s the pretender is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film rosanna arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for david cronenberg as a very low rent livia soprano john savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about i did pot but this is worse a goth chick shows up with the odd explanation that she s a stripper from des moines the obligatory latino drug dealer appears in iowa with a limited budget the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations we certainly see them go crazy while the iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery the accents and church references are confusingly southern baptist guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner city drug dealing movie the songs of iowa s best known bard greg brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits i hope they were used with permission i caught this at its commercial run in nyc because i missed it at the tribeca film festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz 
__label__0 this picture reminds me of a keneth more picture from 1957 called the admirable crighton whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant madonna did ok in some movies however this one doesn t fire if there is any picture that show madonna can t act it is this one i am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of the admirable crighton but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail the plot is loose and the acting is mediocre the script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location while many here have canned madoona for all her acting i think that in films like a league of their own was quite good and enjoyable and who s that girl showed a quirkiness of madonna s style not shown before or afterwards other madonna films are not as enjoyable and i would have liked a to see a madonna animation series with the character from who s that girl i like the music from these two films however swept away remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so everyone has a bomb right

__label__1 it d be easy to call guys and dolls great it s got frank sinatra and marlon brando and contrary to sinatra s original wishes the casting works it s got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption and most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself if it s not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldn t be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l mankiewicz not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it s being performed for the stage as opposed to film it s hard to tell at times brando and sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screen the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999 s she s all that well not quite but close a gambler and 14 year betrothed played by sinatra wants to host a big time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch so he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab the only way he can get it is through a big time bet with fellow gambler brando who s put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker it allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn on turn off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by jean simmons who falls for brando it is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other obviously without getting married or too compromised mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in hell even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and big star quality the story and characters eventually wind down to what you d hope will happen and that s fine all we ask for and what we get is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down my favorites were the number with the lady cats at the club luck be a lady and the two numbers down in havana cuba a

__label__1 i often wonder why this series was slammed so much i thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed i think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued sally phillips simon pegg peter serafinowicz and not least julian rhind tutt of the hugely successful green wing the writers graham linehan and arthur matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age anyone that can produce comedy like father ted couldn t be capable of writing something not worthy of publication if it is ever issued i will certainly buy it

__label__1 the most satisfying element about dan in real life is that the relationship between dan steve carell and marie juliette binoche makes sense and is beautifully realistic the casting of oscar winner juliette binoche as dan s love interest was a superb decision she is exceptionally talented intelligent naturally attractive and thank goodness appropriately aged for the part had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson it would have been a disaster another wonderful aspect about dan in real life is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the frat pack formula dumb chicks chauvinistic guys and sleazy jokes dan in real life is witty and has fun intelligent laughs throughout whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing the jokes from dan in real life are more natural and clever and involve some thinking on the part of the audience my only problem with dan in real life is that the rebellious middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson it s difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director either way her character is unrealistic and annoying but this is only a minor flaw in the film and does not take away from the story as a whole all in all dan in real life is a great film a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed down comedies the quality of the writing directing acting and especially cinematography is excellent it is simply a beautiful light hearted comedy 
__label__0  unhinged is one strange little film a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre it s hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique it s plot is fairly overdone three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter very quickly the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic on top of that the mother and daughter seem to have a very very strange relationship as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them halfway through the film when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help the killing begins as far as the acting goes this film is at the bottom of the barrel none of the three stranded girls can act particularly the lead girl it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the film the mother and daughter are better but not much the film is also quite dull in parts and really really drags the killings are gruesome but nothing we haven t seen before however as mentioned on here the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic sleepaway camp unfortunately the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring boring pacing the isolated creepy looking mansion and the dark foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes 4 out 10
__label__1 i thought that this film was very enjoyable i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child therefore i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so then they were obviously going to be disappointed this is simply an animated movie nothing more if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained you will not be disappointed in closing this is definitely not the best movie disney has made but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received 
__label__1 tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks so much action and humor this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin the film maker s personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving a great documentary of a very talented and well loved artist a great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world 
__label__0 i just got back from the film and i m completely appalled this movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind the theatre i was in maybe had 4 other people this movie was recommended to me and i couldn t believe that this person liked it i can t believe that any sane human would like it there was no plot no plot at all it was a joke how can you make a movie about nothing this movie only goes to show why hollywood is in such a shambles i can only just look at the spiral of the horror movie industry and giggle what a travesty to all filmaking this is true of all the new teen horror flicks grudge boogeyman ring saw series it is all such trash don t support this kind of hogwash 
__label__1 the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love by far the most romantic at least one of them movie of all times 
__label__0 pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad tracey really doesn t have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isn t worth renting and the short movie before didn t do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans oh well maybe the next one will be better cant ge t much worse
__label__1  the garden of allah was one of the first feature length 3 strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disney s 5 year exclusivity deal was 1935 s becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for it s garish color costumes the garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat 
__label__0 this version is pretty insipid i m afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william hurt s weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt i also can t believe that they eliminated edward s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the 70 s version with george c scott and susannah york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched rochester s character the way that scott did 
__label__0 julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but it s hard to imagine she d end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it it s nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it the plot has all the markings of a late night made for cable and don t be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without roberts name above the title i m sure it would have totally flopped deservedly 
__label__1 i really don t understand why people get so upset and pan this movie remember folks this is an snl movie not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction the ladies man is a hilarious movie albeit stupid at times with a wacked out cast and as usual wonderful performances by will ferrel and tim meadows yes some of the jokes are stupid and yes the characters are unbelievable but its comedy i really don t understand how anyone couldn t laugh a lot during this hilarious film anyway all i ask is that people take this as it is an snl silly and irreverent comedy nothing that will win awards but nonetheless some modern comedy gold 10 4 apricot 
__label__0 a trio of low life criminals led by matt dillon botches a late night burglary they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist the real terrorist gets away and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar taking hostages unaware why the police are so intent on catching them and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night unbelievable absolutely and it goes down hill from there spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent matt dillon faye dunaway gary sinise viggo mortensen and m emmett walsh but they re all wasted mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar all they do for the remainder of the film is argue endlessly and aimlessly long before the conclusion of the film you ve stopped giving a damn about what happens to them 
__label__0 ok where do we start with this little gem mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england town only one man can stop them and that man is mike brady now if that wasn t laughable enough stay tuned the footage of the slugs is what s known as stock footage no matter who the slugs attack or where they are the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown keep in mind this singular shot occupies at least half the movie the acting in the movie was knock down drag out steal your wallet punch your girlfriend kill your dog bad i m sure there s worse but you re going to be hard pressed to find it the only gem was you guessed it mike brady he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca because he was the best in the bunch as for horror this film is not to be taken seriously there isn t horror they re slugs for crying out loud the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two only watch this film in a mst3k type environment otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain 
__label__0 well here i go with another b industry movie it s sad enough to see some badly made films but i don t care if a b industry or c industry produces the film show some effort in your work the characters are really bad the acting isn t in question in this one surprise but plot is how can a tight knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered and then go on as if nothing happened what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor s ass was give me a break 
__label__1 probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful dramatic episode in this case the superb balance of terror with a lighter affair shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci fi and while the formula isn t quite right yet in this entry the true triumph is trouble with tribbles in season 2 the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness diverting from the show s tradition the enterprise isn t on any proper mission in this episode instead kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty a well deserved break after three months of incessant work the earth like planet a budget related fact is very appealing but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens dr mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll s work soon other people begin experiencing similar things a woman meets a don juan like character sulu has a run in with a samurai and kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy throw in a freakishly real looking tiger and it s easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what s going on before anybody gets hurt the idea is a classic one idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly the episode s humorous take on the topic is rather successful weren t it for a dark turn of events that doesn t sit well with the rest of course everything works out fine again come the end and the cast s general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves most notably and ironically the otherwise hilarious william shatner and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new previously unseen things the definition of star trek s success 7 5 10
__label__1 what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and bulky big budget fantasy this is takashi miike had already proved by the time he got to the great yokhai war that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime yakuza genre visitor q and andromedia showed this the former great the latter lesser but here miike in his first and only co screen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a post modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it boatload of cgi creature effects and make up and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kids as big heroes power hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source machinery as the greatest evil and many bizarrely defined flamboyantly designed creatures or yokai of the title but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the gungan battle in tpm and to the whole power play between good and evil with similar forces or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to henson s films and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or over reaching moments it s miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters here ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world but will become the hero in a world going into darkness the darkness is from an evil sorcerer who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures the yokhai into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission to destroy and kill anything in their paths tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato s main minion and cohort agi kill bill s chiaki kuriyama another great villainies steals tadashi s little furry companion a sunekosuri soon things come to a head in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories but can only be contained up to a point by miike and his crew i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids but in the forward note that it s not some watered down fantasy in american circles this has creatures galore including a one eyed umbrella stand and a walking talking wall not to mention a turtle a fire serpent and a woman who became cursed by sato so the variety is on high on that end and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects which grows to unfathomable heights when the festival hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope but there s also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike s disposal and not just because it s cuteness squared where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form yet through all of this the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike s career is here as well which distinguishes it from its animated muppet and sci fi counterparts there s the bizarre humor as usual including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes i loved for example the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller or the anxious turtle yokai the biggest danger with miike s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry which he flirts with is overkill on this end he s got everything down i m sure with storyboards and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions one of them is when all is said and done and tadashi and the other human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant and some visuals like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map just seem weak and pat i almost wondered if miike might dip into bad spy kids territory quite frankly but this liability aside the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement goofy thrills and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies it owes a lot to cinema as well as traditional japanese folklore but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats it s not the filmmaker at his very best but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage it s got a neat little message and lots of cool adventure 7 5 10
__label__1 at least something good came out of damon runyon s misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mafia guys and dolls the seemingly indestructible stage musical was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l mankiewicz all about eve in a colorful enjoyable movie that featured an all star cast including vivian blaine from the original broadway show jean simmons whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in roman holiday and two of the all time great leading men frank sinatra and marlon brando both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor from here to eternity and best actor on the waterfront and were on the top of their game one listen to brando singing luck be a lady tonight speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice stubby kaye steals the show as nicely nicely johnson who brings down the house with sit down you re rocking the boat the ubiquitous sheldon leonard adds yet another page to his rogue s gallery of screen gangsters the film has a bright cartoonish look anticipating the pop art of the early 1960s the characters speak in a stylized patois apparently based on yiddish idioms although the film s social attitudes and gender roles are dated it s all great fun and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes 
__label__0 well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s this is one of them just one of the girls is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can t keep up the charade for too much longer i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn t even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who d want to watch this if you re looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 this is about the point that haim s career tanked 
__label__1 scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element all pseudo science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed when he summons his rivals who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him to witness his discovery they propose a joint expedition to africa of course they end up stealing much of dr rukh s original discovery giving him only residual credit in addition to that an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst abbot costello lawton literally steals dr rukh s young trophy wife drake who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being having grown horns like a deer wasn t going to make dr rukh karloff any friendlier so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr benet lugosi the only one who had helped him finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but to my utmost dissatisfaction sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married acting is mostly fine with karloff lugosi being very good check the hysterical chambermaid scene other characters aren t worth mentioning recommended much like all old universal horrors 
__label__1 there are so many words i want to use to describe this movie but can t really do that can i this movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit laugh cry and then pee i m serious don t watch this movie if you re easily offended by profanity sex nudity homosexuality and everything else associated with nature being a woman and that might not even be a factor i can watch this movie over and over again trey parker and matt stone are absolutely brilliant along with all their other debuts i think baseketball is the prize winner i m laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie watch the movie that s all i m going to say it s sort of hard for me to leave this comment because i m one of those people like ozzy osbourne who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak so i m keeping it professional best movie heck yeah 
__label__0 the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ somehow according to the plot god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it s self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer the lead character an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it s self meanwhile with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people s beliefs it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment silly
__label__0 there is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel it was drivel when it was a vhs rental and it s drivel on satellite re runs now it might fool you because it has 2 moderately well known names in kistofferson and henriksen reasonable soundtrack music and nice monument valley scenery it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot if that s all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you happy it s still drivel though 
__label__0 as if there weren t enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori 1973 which i had watched earlier this year the marquee value name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters apart from not looking minimally sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl antonio sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster apart from being a resistible leading man his relationship with savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter s spirited teenage niece besides for a gangster flick there s precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled furthermore the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else incidentally the bargain basement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members or even the film s title is ever listed 
__label__0 this movie makes several mistakes a few american actors in spain and the spanish actors speaking english the spaniards english is ok but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying the dialog through the whole script is very weak it may have been a spanish script but translated incorrectly who knows and who cares i can only assume that these are famous spanish actors forced into the english language they may be good but not in this flop you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes thats how pathetic it is then the rest is just bad lots of waste of time lots of un necessary plots oh did i mention one of the baldwins is in this 
__label__1 not only was this movie better than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen looking at the top 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to 2 i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn t mind i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again 
__label__0 i was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror to my disappointment this turned into more of a comedy than a horror the acting dialog and flow of the movie was all very poorly done much of it didn t make sense for example there s a party of about 30 people and they re all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard i kept thinking maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome emphasis on try the blood and gore are also poorly done i ve seen halloween costumes look more believable than this a guy with his head cut clean off looked clean missing signs bone flesh blood and even the head a strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist but contradicted other parts in the story what was going in the guy s mind to turn out like that if there was going to be a twist you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense 
__label__0 this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i ve spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies you d probably say that s hard to imagine but never the less it s true after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew that i had to see it if you re a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldn t you the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting unfortunately the movie is none of these from the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop if you re reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty five minutes i m afraid you are in for disappointment why is it so bad you might be asking yourself let me tell you the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious the script was at best laughable there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn t the acting was absolutely dreadful i like nicholas cage but this was a miss without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique finally the story is completely transparent you can see the end of this movie coming a mile away i am not usually a very harsh critic frankly when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mystery suspense horror i just want to be surprised this movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment do yourself a favor and go see something else 
__label__0 i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move it wasn t funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing terrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now being married with gordon gekko and all but if you haven t seen it don t waste your time a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in god s hands 
__label__0 although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal mart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it 
__label__1 first off i would just like to say what a big fan of bette midler s i am stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast bette midler john goodman trini alvarado stephen collins marsha mason this is one of my favorite films of all time it deals with a mother raising a child on her own she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it roger ebert gave is 3 1 2 stars and it deserved 4 wonderful i give it 4 out of 4 
__label__1 it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant it captures more than the nostalgia of the time it has a real heart to it it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful a simple story is always effective when done well this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one am looking out for his next project the follow up is always the most difficut thing it s like the second album blues for most people i just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film cheers to all enjoy your cinema 
__label__1  pecker proves that waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age a lot of things have changed since waters started making films in the 1960s but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do over the years the budget of waters films has increased considerably this is one of his most recent productions but i was amazed to see that waters still has that trailer park touch edward furlong plays pecker a kid who is obsessed with photography he lives a quite life in baltimore md with his friends and family but pecker attracts the attention of a new york art agent the always watchable lili taylor and his life changes for the worst once again waters makes fun of art fame and heterosexuality it is not among his best films but there are some big belly laughs here memama has the best lines in the film it is consistently clever and funny and has that very queer sensibility that i have come to love in warters movies 
__label__0  i love new york is another entry by vh 1 mtv networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ebonics speaking craziest contestant and her mother and give them a show on this network many will argue this is a show true it s not as bad as it s previous show flavor of love but it s just as bad it reminds me of a skit from the 90 s show in living color where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on the love connection dating show and he picked robin givens for a date mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in this show reminds me of that the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto you ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv but these are professional reality actors so why bother it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network well you can t hate them for trying to make a buck maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour or wonder if she and her mother s next show would be on the wwf any way you slice it it s a train wreck you ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately 
__label__0 beyond dirt cheap this shot on video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through it s got the typical gore that you d expect in a zombie movie but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while what s strange is that this is an amateur german video and the version i saw is english dubbed the dubbers seem to be american fans penpals of the germans who can t decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy one character a white german of course is dubbed by a black guy apparently who speaks with thick ebonics kno wahm sayin comrad 
__label__0 in theory director s commentary should have worked the talented rob bryden plays peter delane a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are bonanza flambards the duchess of duke street and the bounder his commentaries are not the least bit informative due to his habit of wandering off the point but in practice it failed dismally it is a one joke show and the joke is not particularly funny the scripts are completely lacking in wit and bryden fails to convince as an old man whenever stuck for anything amusing to say which is like every five seconds he issues a hissing laugh rather than being amused by delane you want to shoot him if senile old men strike you as hilarious then this is for you it didn t help that the shows mocked were with the exceptions of mr mrs and crossroads rather good for the joke to work they needed to be really dreadful such as charlie s angels o t t telly addicts neighbours and new faces the show tanked big time so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions wouldn t it be deliciously ironic if director s commentary were someday itself the subject of a spoof

__label__0 as much as i like japanese movies this one didn t just cut it a movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot the photography is ok though i ve seen much better sword fight scenes in other japanese movies the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn t convince me at all the soundtrack is so weak you don t even notice its presence but worst of all was the way the plot evolved i have to admit that at some times i had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a hollywood influence all in all if your looking for an action japanese movie this isn t it its very slow with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental in a bad way 
__label__1 screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture he reveres them yet audrey hepburn is naturally put a notch above the others because after all she s the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior he shoots her in loving close ups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard boiled soft boiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout the love connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john ritter s tv styled klutziness colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthy sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch but it s really hepburn s valentine and she absolutely glows from 
__label__0 the volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters thankfully highly acclaimed director nelson mccormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time rated lower than side out and higher than well umm however don t let the cover of this movie decieve you kill shot stars up and coming star koji as a modern day sherlock holmes using such high tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my gameboy koji is able to aid fbi agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime while there are other actors in the movie including brief cameos by denise richards a gay negro and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl koji carries this movie on his own any fan of movies such as the matrix or hackers will definitely love kill shot 
__label__1 this movie with the alternate title martial law 3 for some reason introduced me to jeff wincott for the first time and it was a great introduction although i had never heard of him before he seemed to be an excellent fighter the action scenes in this movie are great there are lots of them too by the way the recruit fight at the peacekeepers hq is especially good there s just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that s really fun and for the rest of the cast brigitte nielsen was a good choice for the villain roles like this fits her but others don t matthias hues also did a good job as always he s a great fighter and macho like character and was a good rival for wincott in this movie 
__label__0 please help the economy spend your money elsewhere the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her that s it undetected by anyone except cuba and angie she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president cuba a deflects the assassin s bullet which then enters the back of the president s head cuba and angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great lengths to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film cuba speaks with a presidential staff member the psm comments that there was no conspiracy cuba claims there was more than one person involved the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi the cia and the nsa gosh i wonder is the psm is involved ms archer the first lady is a craptacular artist cuba can t make out a painting and she says you re too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective can anyone miss that clue 
__label__1 it could have been a better film it does drag at points and the central story shifts from boyer completing his mission to boyer avenging wanda hendrix s death but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil his stories are all morality tales due to his own considerations of catholicism guilt and innocence very relative terms in his world view and the human condition boyer is luis denard a well known concert pianist who has sided with the republicans in the spanish civil war he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed unfortunately for denard he is literally on his own everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the falagists of spain in particular katina paxinou mrs melendez a grim boarding house keeper and peter lorre mr contreras a teacher of an esperanto type international language wanda hendrix is the drudge of a girl else who works for mrs melendez the local diplomat licata victor francken is already a willing associate of the falangists the brits holmes herbert miles mander and best if not worst of the lot george coulouris don t give much hope to boyer s cause which he soon grasps may be britain s before long herbert and mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the ramsay macdonald s and stanley baldwin s governments during the civil war coulouris here is a typical col blimp type always impeccable in his native english diction he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general the one ray of hope is lauren bacall rose cullen here trying to play her role as well as she can but she can t really she s an aristocrat the daughter of a press lord it was bacall s second film and sad to say almost sank her long career she does act well but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with humphrey bogart and being directed by howard hawks boyer is a fine actor but he s not bogie and herman shumlin is not hawks her next film returned her to bogie and hawks again and her star resumed it s ascendancy it s a bleak film as was the novel boyer s mission never succeeds as he has too many hidden foes all over the place but the villains are likewise also losers frequently with their lives with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of katina paxinou and the man who destroys her it is well worth watching to catch the warner s lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction 
__label__0 i picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious the gamers by dead gentlemen productions which is highly recommendable by the way boy what a disappointment the movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing true it can be funny to use every singe cliché there is about role playing games but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable already at the beginning of each scene you know what the joke will be about but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top there is no subtlety in this movie if there would be captions laugh now or a cheap 80s style fake laughter track it would not make much difference with some scenes you can t help to think yea i get why they thought this would be funny but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke 
__label__1 since douglas macarthur affected more human lives for the better than any other american not elected president he deserved a better film biography not that universal s macarthur is bad it s just not all it should have been oddly enough the potential was there from the very early star trek episode the corbomite maneuver 1966 to the recent hbo films something the lord made 2oo4 and warm springs 2oo5 director joseph sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go the producer frank mccarthy also gave us patton 197o the legendary jerry goldsmith scored both films and universal widely touted the fact that the film was four years in preparation and production yet for all of this macarthur is perfectly adequate and not much more than that the film begins in early 1942 shortly before the beleaguered general was ordered by president franklin d roosevelt dan o herlihy to flee the philippines to avoid capture by the japanese thus this film omits macarthur s birth in 188o in a frontier barracks in arkansas still subject to attack by native american tribesmen thus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows and arrows to thermonuclear weapons his graduation from west point first in a class of 95 how he joined his famous father general arthur macarthur who had earned the medal of honor at missionary ridge in the civil war on assignments in japan china and most importantly in the philippines his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into vera cruz how he leaped about the trenches of world war one like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to brigadier general his postwar service as west point s youngest and most progressive commandant his participation in the court martial of billy mitchell in 1924 his routing of the bonus marchers in 1932 his efforts to sustain a woefully underfunded army as chief of staff in the early 193o s his retirement from the u s army to become field marshal of the army of the philippines and the reactivation of his commission by fdr shortly before the outbreak of the second world war all this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of macarthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by pt boat thus we know that general mac is a legend but not why nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to dugout doug and so patently unfounded the remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly his island hopping hit em where they ain t campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the filipinos i shall return his crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar japan then the difference of opinion with president harry truman a properly feisty ed flanders over the conduct of the korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to congress that old soldiers simply fade away after which he did just that all quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval if macarthur s actions appear noble let them be presented as such if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment since joe sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience s reactions again see warm springs this refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective and finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to midway released about the same time both films were relegated to television directors sargent in this case jack smight on midway and both have a made for tv look even jerry goldsmith s march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his patton theme just another way in which a larger than life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film there was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably there was also greatness and love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that macarthur did what no military commander before him had done he won the peace in the end macarthur like so many film biographies is a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it 
__label__1 as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man s point of view if you ve never watched this show you re in for an extended treat yes there is violence and nudity but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano the thinking man s gangster with the reality of the life he has been born to and quite frankly would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew take a break sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football even carmella his wife when given a chance for a way out finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own if you followed the whole thing you know how it ends if you didn t trust me you ve never seen a tv show end like this 
__label__1 the costumes and make up were grand there were some exceptionally funny lines and the role was made for jim carrey carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing sure this was mostly a movie for kids but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss i expected more from ron howard it s worth a see but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic by any measure 
__label__1 i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible i am attempting to watch all things star trek this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved shades of grey is the first recap episode in the tng series having just watched the shows these clips were fresh in my mind but i noticed how a couple of them were re shot because the film looked better season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me and the actors looked silly like they didn t fit in their own skins the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker s life on the enterprise up until this point the data and riker scene in the holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker s authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon then the admiral kicks his a but good this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi up until this point they have mentioned the fact but they have yet to exploit it let the record show that the st wiki memory alpha claims that imzadi means first and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come here is the article http memory alpha org en wiki imzadi by this point in the series production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci fi behemoth it was destined to become watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows a ds9 movie would have been nice too 
__label__0 ok not possibly honestly the worst movie i ve ever seen this made absolutely no sense there was no plot no characterization no acting just nothing here s what i thought when i first saw it may 28th 2003 caution this is a spoiler alert it s also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced but there is no character explanation as far as i knew the main character was new to this school but apparently not also it appeared that he lived by himself then that he was a foster kid then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves now we come to a main plot point this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus intently on him for the contingency of the movie i think i must have missed a main plot element here there was no reason for the main character to get hooked even if that s the point having no reason why do all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before suddenly follow him and do what he wants so the movie continues on and it gets all right they re running havoc on the school blah blah blah but wait a minute suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the show here wait a second didn t the insane guy specifically tell the main character not to do that it was supposed to be anynomous ah another important plot element has been skipped over the insane guy was supposed to not be insane everyone said he wasn t insane but as the story goes on he is very clearly out of his mind but i thought the news people said he wasn t hm now the movie comes to a close that was the close what the hell was that not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character it didn t answer any questions about the insane guy are these people in the same situation if yes then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this if no then what is the point in saying that s you in two weeks end of the thing that s what i thought then that is pretty much what i still think now it s 6 months down the line and if i can get it for free i might give it another chance but i doubt it i highly doubt it 
__label__1 let me be the first non australian to comment on this i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end it s one of those drama of life films as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive i liked the light and the girls the rest was without too much fault but without too much merit either i yearned for something like the interview or at least some matrix villain element here and there but nothing out of the ordinary the story does teach one about facing one s own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close so not much of an effort to change things is required the smart american beauty sound alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film in the end i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life but to me it didn t seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didn t seem attractive as a story i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie :)
__label__1 this is a must see for anybody who loves thriller s specially political thriller one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled

__label__0 hobgoblins what a concept rick sloan was a master with this film he had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn t act on top of that he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong put it together you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners this movie was very painful the pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your genitals carved out with a spoon and then having the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid 
__label__0 the script for this tv soap opera is so bad that even a hopkins at some point had to play like an undergrad drama student so as to bring some life in his script dead character i do not know whether this was the purpose of the director but hopkins ciano reeked nothing but vanity fear and lack of self esteem the real ciano possibly was all that but then why make a movie about him mussolini was a bit more convincing and his long way down was as if closer to the truth edda mussolini was plain ridiculous not because of sarandon but because of the impotent script while she had to be the central character of this alleged familial drama watch it only if you enjoy venezuelan soap opera 
__label__0 i don t know where to begin the cast is full of people who ve never done anything before or since debralee scott is listed on cover boxes but does not appear in the movie at all the writing is quite bad even for college films it s obviously very low budget with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing the characters are pretty typical for college films timid guy nerd suave black guy tough guys guy with mustache attractive girl small town girl etc the featured teacher is about what s you d expect middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily if you wan t to see a college flick stay clear from this one it s so bad it s not even funny 
__label__1 fräulein doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in western europe has declined in the past 40 years then in the late 60s while the big hollywood studios were on the ropes italy france and england were turning out movies to fill the void left by hollywood s decline there were the james bond pictures doctor no was a surprise hit in the usa it was first released at the century theater chain in nyc with a 99 cent afternoon admission price the clint eastwood spaghetti westerns with a fistful of dollars released by a distributor that never paid the italian producers a dime and french crime movies that usually went to art houses with exceptions like the sicilian clan and there were european co productions like doctor zhivago and of course fräulein doktor with its big budget for the time and the world talent involved fräulein doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later kenneth more playing a british intelligence officer has a line in fräulein doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the wall game the wall being opposite a firing squad with little chance of the spy winning the game that sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders in the vietnam war era of 1969 the steamy scenes between suzy kendall and capucine probably did not damage these performers chances at getting parts in hollywood movies hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses fox would no longer co produce films like the sicilian clan columbia wouldn t distribute films like belmondo s the night caller mgm went even further cutting almost all film production selling its chain of theaters in india for the value of the land underneath and unloading its borehamwood studio facilty as kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in las vegas where a bally casino gift shop sold mgm memorabilia at giveaway prices stuff left over from the auction of mgm s prop warehouses paramount distributed fräulein doktor but gulf and western s charles bludhorn who had taken over the company and canned the studio s aged board of directors unloaded the studio s film library to universal as i recall and really became interested in movies after production chief robert evans started turning out one hit after another but that was in the 70s fräulein doktor with its lesbian scene was buried with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s kenneth more was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older especially in the bbc detective series father brown when he was younger as in the british movie titanic he played his standard reserved british officer in fräulein doktor he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual as i recall it would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate about his role and of course those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle that was some scene and alberto lattuada showed he was some director helming this world war i espionage movie where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen 
__label__1 caught this film at the arizona international film festival i wasn t expecting a lot though the festival s director told me it was one of the best films submitted five minutes into it i was sold shot in b w on a shoestring budget this film is hilarious the acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid the acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting not this one it features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with tourette s syndrome i ve ever seen the plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous if you get the chance see this movie filmmakers like majkowski hope i got that right deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience

__label__0 first it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another 20 minutes then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife all of this should have taken 10 15 minutes at most simply as a set up for the real action intrigue and plot twists by the time the real action gets going i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end hackman is great as usual and the other actors as well but this is a dud of the first magnitude

__label__1 this was soul provoking i am an iranian and living in th 21st century i didn t know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather you see that today or even in 1925 on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on demand but here 80 years ago people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass it s really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep but they lose many the sheep on their way i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe they were as tough as bakhtiari people 
__label__1 i totally got drawn into this and couldn t wait for each episode the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be together with the effects it would have on those closest the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all explained at the end we couldn t hear clearly what was said and have no idea what gary s part in the whole thing was why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either very strange but maybe we missed something crucial 
__label__0 how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k i ll never know gymkata is a ridiculous action movie filled or is that empty with paper thin plots dumb characters and preposterous situations but take it from me if you enjoy watching poor yet goofy movies you will enjoy gymkata a great deal the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents at least i think they were government agents to become a spy you see his dad was another quasi government agent who has gone missing competing in this game called eloquently the game so the gymnast played blandly by kurt thomas trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad sounds promising doesn t it okay so it doesn t but still that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn t begin to describe the joys of this movie they can be found in the movie s strange details like the gymnast s mysterious asian girlfriend who doesn t speak for the first half hour of the movie then all of a sudden begins to talk and doesn t shut up for the rest of the time or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break the game s non existent rules whenever he so pleases and of course there s our hero s delightful romp through the village of the crazies evidently that s the place s real name nice place to visit but i wouldn t want to live there but where this movie really shines is the action scenes since our protagonist is a gymnast the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses it has to be seen to be believed one interesting thing of note a lot i d say about half the cast dies from being shot with an arrow interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie if these were indeed effects my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds more likely this was the film s way of not paying extras nevertheless gymkata deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing

like lucy lui who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face maybe it s the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they re uttered by people like kiera knightly who if you buy as a bounty hunter then you ll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012 nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility absolutely nobody at all it is a painful and misguided experience taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them the principal question is was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she s coming across as tough but really she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school attempting to impress her peers there are things you genuinely don t know how to react to whether they re supposed to be funny or not if it is supposed to be a comedy that begs the next question is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs i don t think so the film opens with the title card based on a true story sort of if that s supposed to be some sort of post modernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose then you re simply on another planet truth is in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying sort of which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer following this we learn of domino s relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the sort of cop out as in real life she was just four but if the film had gone by reality s dates then her entire drive would ve been born out of the death of her goldfish we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey rourke domino knightley herself and would be love interest choco ramírez during the scene an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son s life to be spared what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers fire off weapons at innocents we don t know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads a feeling of no why are you doing this why is this happening bad seeds are planted and wouldn t you know it they stick the film is painful to watch excruciating even as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills 90210 here is another daft post modernist slant people playing themselves and that sort of joker card being played again christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jr s natural born killers character so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and choco s gang purely for her good looks i might add it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver s registration i ds or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another the problem is as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isn t a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up if there is any feeling between choco and domino it exists on such a small tiny minimalist scale that you have to ask why it s even included so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative wise we find out the reason for the fake i ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded he must ve swam really quickly double the speed of the film s fasted edit which means something in the region of 01 of a second yeah sure the film s story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up plus there s a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film s comedy runs so dry that it has to resort to the jerry jerry chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show when did we last laugh at jerry jerry when we were say seven years old i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film s existence 
__label__1 i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my 3 film i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film it s nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like så som i himmelen this was a very good film and i m sure a very hard film to pull together with it s large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well rounded cast i would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9 0 on a scale of 10 
__label__0 oh this is so bad it is funny the only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun i mean you get to see porn actresses topless having sex then killed by human mutants there is plenty of gore including the classic something is wrong with her oh no it s half the person she used to be and the accidental murder caused by panic but you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone s ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward like in cartoons somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn they really need to know what s inside an actress mere genitals are not enough therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos there is no dialog jenna and chasey have really small parts and i really wonder what richard grieco wanted when accepting a role here i think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff just to be reminded of the old school c class horror movies 
__label__1 this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons each episode was a new short story the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesn t fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn t have the talent to pull it off i would suggest watching the series if it is available it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or 45 minutes story to 2 hours so it has to get draggy even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven t watched the original tv serial the script and the ending of the serial was much better spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him he is aware and tell her that he doesn t want to be repayed and never helped with that intention the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement the deliver just wasn t right but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi i am not sure if this is premchand munshi s story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi s and other great hindi writers stories 
__label__0 i find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can t muster the film making prowess to pull it off the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesn t take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror the surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon a scruffy and half mad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father s paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirrel eating albino part of the movie s charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didn t really expect it to come out this way but it s good enough wrap scene blur hopelessly take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug addled feverish stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father s voice as she reads his diary while we re still talking about a living dead picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious dark stranger who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater i generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it s not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks the general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyuck s general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and i d file messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it s not particularly gory trashy or sleazy 
__label__1  the college girl murders is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace and generally my first real acquaintance with krimi films in general and i can say that i m moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so goofy the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings there s some james bond type of evil mastermind who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison there s also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist kkk member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i don t care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky 60 s soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time it s like a variant on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements 
__label__1 famous words of foreign nightclub owner roman maroni that lousy cork sucker who spends the whole movie not only as johnny dangerously s rival but butchering the english language as well another underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon matinées or late late late show s johnny dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother s medical care and put his brother through law school yes there s a story but who cares a cast that includes joe piscopo dom deluise marilu henner and alan hale jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next there s too many laughs in this to put on here like airplane you have to pay attention or you ll miss something highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two 
__label__1 this is a great film if this is any indication than hong sang soo really is asian cinema s best kept secret it s very similar in style to tsai ming liang and hou hsiao hsien and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically but i think i actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films the overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work although it still completely fits that style the camera never moves even once and somehow i found the film less self consciously slow than tsai ming liang or hou hsiao hsien which i think is part of the reason i enjoyed it more plus it doesn t keep it s subjects quite as detached as hou does i felt like the film was also somehow more complete and less open ended just barely than some of their work although that s not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward moving plot i would have a hard time believing that sophia coppola wasn t directly influenced by this film for lost in translation scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can t help but seem familiar 
__label__1 i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it i was very moved by this movie i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault as in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with leo who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men this is in no way meant to bash gays i am gay and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others the only part of the movie i couldn t understand was why the gay friendly family was unwilling to include marcel in leo s illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex 
__label__1 i haven t laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie kudos to steve carrell who i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i haven t seen before and catherine keener is excellent as always thank god there wasn t a cameo from will ferrell love him but saw him too much this summer there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell and partly thanks to the writing also carrell the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hysterical i will definitely go see 40 year old virgin when it s released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it 
__label__1 this movie was not so much promoted here in greece even though it got good actors great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very powerful it s about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after been released from a 5yo prison time drugs the end is rather sad mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression 
__label__0 last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride she finds tarzan and jane who try to protect her george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn t used to his full advantage also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player singer who goes into song every so often even the great robert florey can t aid this one 1 2 of four 
__label__0 not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid killer tongue is an uneasy mixture of sci fi horror and supposed comedy what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film there is very little dialog mainly due to the fact that the script if there was one is complete pond scum i wouldn t even call it strange more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to disappoint and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this and if you do the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish merk
__label__1 this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan really i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background shintaro katsu also known as the original zatoichi gives a superb performance as izo okada one of the four hitokiri human slayer of the bakumatsu he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei played by tatsuya nakada ryonosuke out of sword of doom hanpei is a ultra nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro west politicians in order to achieve his political goals izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore okada s killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto who is a samurai who rejects violence does he change his ideas and views on life but too late watch the movie to see the end of izo okada shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance each actor reaches up to their role the sword fights a very unique and fast probably faster than several movies nowadays check it out if you have the chance 
__label__0 i watch bad movies this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie not an ounce of humor not an ounce of talent throughout i am lazy usually i see a bad movie and curse this was so bad i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to i am smashing my copy of this movie it s too lame even to use clear a room so boring watch bloodsucking freaks or shock shock shock for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment this sludge looks awful is awful and whoever made it should feel awful 
__label__1 this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs this film never tries to tone it down cotton candy ize or soft soap the angst confusion and pain of what these guys live with that is its strength i think but more so the performances are fantastic with well conceived and delivered dialog which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what s on their mind what s in their hearts i found it plodding but enjoyable it rates a 6 6 10 from the fiend 
__label__1 a super unusual film from audiard read my lips is a pulpy lonely hearts thriller it s perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean pierre jeunet unconventionally beautiful she s referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film versatile and capable of a subordinate profile this is almost the definition of her role as carla a put upon office dogsbody taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness yet she finds an ami d exploitation if you like in cassel s ex con paul each exploits the other s unconventional talents theft and lip reading to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement devos audiard manage carla s deafness and its attendant warped inner world with discreet stylish flair in this film 2001 audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit a prophet of nine years later 7 10
__label__0 this really was the worst movie i have ever seen michael vartan is hot but who is this woman and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie the hair is so bad they talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is really really boring i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good hhaha they literally just like talk and say yeah and there is no passion whatsoever i could not tell at all that they were in love i m sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen 
__label__0 honestly where can i begin this was a low budget horribly acted film it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was the sword fighting scenes weren t even sword fights they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there it was the sawtooth island movie i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene oh and the plot of the film the story board the script etc was a bunch of garbage that i don t even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it but if you happen to stumble upon this movie do not get it 
__label__0 this one came out during the western genre s last gasp unfortunately it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort even if made by and with veterans in the field to begin with the plot offers nothing remotely new james coburn escapes from a chain gang intent on killing the man now retired who put him there charlton heston while the latter lays a trap for him coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter barbara hershey naturally the former lawman accompanied by hershey s greenhorn fiancé chris mitchum sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers all of whom broke jail along with him rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub fordian style mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach with which he s never fully at ease repellent characters plenty of violence and the sexual tension generated by hershey s presence among coburn s lusty bunch incidentally heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western the troubled major dundee 1965 i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan and scan format off tcm uk anyway the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for suggested also by the title then again both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres will penny 1968 for heston and coburn with pat garrett billy the kid 1973 at least though heston maintains a modicum of dignity here his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be the latter however tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates gang rape of hershey apart from the latter this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid 1961 the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two obsolete protagonists as was his fashion heston s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff jorge rivero as coburn s mexican lieutenant and larry wilcox of the tv series chips as the youngest member of coburn s gang who s assigned the task of watching over hershey while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but at the same time unremarkable score 
__label__0 i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered why i didn t walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately several people in our theater did and sadly i didn t follow them out the story lacked all criteria for a movie no plot awful acting even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk i did like the tazer scene too bad it didn t shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film 
__label__0 this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didn t get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i don t know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie i want those two hours back if you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons watch napoleon dynamite instead 
__label__1 it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today s standards the film is interesting and provocative therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl s school therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly the director radley metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography artistically however this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas therese and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism 
__label__0 killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes aren t the same jokes are lame even the actors aren t as funny because that s the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be funny so now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldn t have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy 
__label__0 when a movie like the dukes of hazzard brings in over 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe i m just not realizing how many people this kind of no effort trash will appeal to hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen this is that i walked out despite getting a free movie pass the dialogue could not be dumber the stunts could not be more over the top and outrageous perhaps this bigger that big image appeals to texans but it didn t appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater none of the big names were in this career ending flick except for burt reynolds which says all you need to hear jessica simpson don t make me laugh i wouldn t even recommend this film for video even if you were desperate this was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing they did despite the public being forewarned stupidity abound 
__label__1 believe it or not at 12 minutes this film for 1912 is a full length film very very few films were longer than that back then but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest no what s different is that all the actors with the exception of one frog are bugs yes bugs this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin laurel and hardy or max linder but instead this russian production uses bugs or i think models that looked just like bugs chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume linder was busy so perhaps that s why they used bugs using stop motion the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well and a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong 21 years later the film starts with mr beetle sneaking off for a good time he goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home but unfortunately for mr beetle he is caught on camera by a local film buff plus he doesn t know it but mrs beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter of course there s a lot more to this domestic comedy than this but the plot is age old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike weird but also very amazing and watchable 
__label__0 the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations the evil dead 1982 style from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him he succeeds not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative two days later ray travis quentin young along with his sister dawn erica hoag her boyfriend nick craig bonacorsi four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin the evil dead style with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude show s up with his axe starts to slaughter the friends one by one edited written executive produced directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me i m just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes it has every bad slasher cliché the character s are awful the dialogue is terrible it s hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film the teens are even more annoying stupid than usual the script is more moronic predictable flawed than usual the killer lumberjack dude is just lame then there s the final 10 minutes or so which if you make it that far believe it s tough going produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i m concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn t want to know it stop reading now basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen nick dawn everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story i felt their pain then proceed to pick holes in it laugh at it from saying why did they stand around argue why didn t they pick the axe up such things i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap to have it shoved down my throat made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap could see all the holes in it went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes which we have just had to sit through remember is just a little grating then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up kills everyone within two minutes why didn t he do that to start with it would have saved everyone a lot of time director portugal turns in a real mess this has the worst continuity between night day in a film i have ever seen the whole film is meant to set at night i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn t work most of it looks like it is set during the day for example look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom she climbs out of the window it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground the films cuts to an exterior shot it s bright daylight then there s the fact ranger vince says we can t get a search party out here until the morning indicating it was supposed to be night then several minutes later when he walks outside it looks like it s the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it s night anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows it s pitch black outside when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen there isn t much gore there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable it s not scary there s no tension or atmosphere the appalling day night continuity is just so distracting because it s so obvious technically the film is rock bottom again the continuity between night day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is the special effects are poor they couldn t even afford to show a car blowing up even though it s pretty vital to the plot this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish the acting is absolutely brilliant everyone involved should get an oscar nah only joking not really they were utterly awful even the girls who got their breasts out weren t very good looking the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam it has awful effects is boring has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i ve got it totally wrong it s the most clever not recommended watch a decent slasher from the 70 s or 80 s to remind you how they should be done 
__label__0 on a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk he releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship they dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star this massive craft is populated by only three people presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors anyway to cut a long story short the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies the psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying annoying is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic unhinged frightening dangerous maybe but not annoying but he is the three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles this ship is practically the size of a city considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man made craft could exist never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task despite the vast size of the spaceship the crew all have appallingly kitted out tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs but there are a lot of corridors the film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci fi thriller but nothing great 
__label__0 why was this film made even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go ahead for goodness sakes the actors cast in this film are aussie b grade celebs not actors people like john michael hollywood howson the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday and the voice over guy in countdown but in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none the script is bad even for a self confessed b grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse it often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has realism anyone interested in australian cinema please for the love of god pretend this film was never made 
__label__1 as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male female relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the male for those of us that don t speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonable the soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the film s variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies there s a wes craven in chicago feel to it 
__label__0 the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem ah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i d say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u s government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say you ll see things a bit different than before first off weather data doesn t come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims :)
__label__1 my all time favorite movie oscar caliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrence s best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel 
__label__1 walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to i ve heard that before where ah from kubrick s eyes wide shut track 2 got it just as i arrived at the door it s waltz no 2 from jazz suite no 2 composed by dimitri shostakovich performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower s what a treat the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz it s not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ennio morricone beginning notes of track 6 have traces of nuovo cinema paradiso georges delerue and john barry there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him a relationship alone to them both director marleen gorris of antonia s line 1996 academy award s best foreign language film from the netherlands gave us a quietly sensitive film not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect the front end subject is the mind game and mathematical logic of chess beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920 s cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss border i highly recommend the soundtrack if you don t feel like going to the movies alexandre desplat s lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete 
__label__1 mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch he s a modern genius because he s not only a film maker his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best it s a film not to be missed late richard farnsworth s performance is one of the reasons 8 10
__label__0 recently i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city olathe ks of this title it is difficult for me being a lover of the art as i am to report the following but the truth sometimes hurts and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe i m using the slang definition here worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half i feel obligated to share warn any interested parties let s begin at the beginning a good place to start as always the first 15 minutes are not really that bad a couple of laughs and decent development but then it is downhill from there this is the story of a woman in her mid thirties that as the writer would like for you to believe is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled the first major difficulty occurs when if you don t know that fact going into the movie you won t know it when she suddenly risks it all for in my opinion a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman there is little development drastically insufficient development to justify her actions for the affair she has and when it occurs one feels as i did that she is just of low moral character the word slut comes to mind hopefully they ll let that pass the review and post the comment this in my opinion is the first fatal flaw of the film if you re married or have ever been in love irregardless of whether you are male or female its going to turn you off quite frankly i feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that s the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving the second fatal flaw is the casting diane lane just didn t work for me here and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job believe me the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places conveying a subtle yet very blunt i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate portrayal of an emerging teen bravo well done i m not going to give the ending away but i was disappointed being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that well if that teased you enough to see this picture don t say i didn t warn you but you better look fast if this celluloid is released i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames i d say wait for the video but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value hmmm dustin hoffman produced this you think he d learn after ishtar this film once carried the working title blouse man and should have been left on the rack if you ve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film give this one 35 40 minutes the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin if you can stomach the fact that you ll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you re off to the movies to see this one that s my two cents for what it is worth 
__label__0 play mystery theater 3000 at home with your friends rent this movie for the laughs the acting is poor the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable i thought the movie was a joke until i looked it up on imbd i can t wait to rent the sequel china o brien ii 
__label__1 out of these pokemon films which are in order of best to least for me pokemon the first movie pokemon 4ever pokemon heroes pokemon 200 and pokemon entei and the unknown this is probably the one most concerning the environment arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one whether these are good points for you or not pokemon 4ever still has entertained many as well as the three points covered above this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi as well as anime the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket the comic reliefs rubbish baddies end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks the flaws are as always the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting even more so than a few pokemon film baddies a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere meanwhile ash brock and misty are entering a large forest curious watch the rest good for all pokemon fans and american anime movie fans enjoy pokemon 4ever :)
__label__1 i saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant it is great and much better than j f k cause you always have to think can it happen to me can i become a murderer you cannot turn of the tv or your vcr without thinking about the plot and the end which you should nt miss under any circumstances 
__label__0 i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it was now i am pretty conservative in my views but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and end ok the plot was solid single president falls for a lobbyist ok this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney annette bening there were several ridiculous premises in this movie 1 the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a closer could she have been more flighty she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything hardly a closer i am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst 2 secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue give me a break i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible 3 the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu was a joke first no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group second why even bring something like that up you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative i thought the plot was great and unique i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president but the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failed its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
__label__1 just saying you ve got a movie about john holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen but writer director james cox delivers oh so much more a rashamon of the sleazy hollywood set the film splitters the july 1981 wonderland murders through a variety of angles and film stocks but mostly through the filter of john holmes coked out weasel brain in a film full of bad guys holmes is either the most vile the most pathetic or both several versions of the story emerge and merge as cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting the dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false while the film takes places two years after holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches this sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown not even at the climax though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos once again val kilmer as holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working strutting cringing bragging or begging kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck stand out performances beside kilmer definitely include ted levine as the lead cop in the investigation and lisa kudrow as holmes estranged wife the trio of criminals holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy josh lucas the ever interesting timothy blake nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable dylan mcdermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about wonderland there is always a worse version possible but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth 
__label__1 what a perfect example of less is more kurt russell sgt todd only has 72 lines and something like 104 words what a challenge like a black and white photo when your mind s eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact this is one of those top 5 movies i can t live without right up there with the classics like road warrior if you liked this check out mad max 2 the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson also gladiator with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also the thirteenth warrior starring antonio banderas and blade runner starring harrison ford 
__label__1 note these comments are for people who have seen the movie vanilla sky is a brilliant complex and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag line says lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie goers if one looks at it from a different angle considering the following now i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my assertions and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie doesn t fall into place where exactly does the debatable splice occur now i m not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l e technician since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames s mind dream coma state but the true splice between reality and dream it seems to me that the reality of the car crash the way that it is filmed no explosion for example is a likely splice point and that any particular sequence containing an existential dream coma non reality feel to it whether it s shown onscreen before or after the crash is actually a part of aames personal journey toward self realization inside of his own mind in that respect then we are left with two questions at the very end if you know of more let me know is aames actually disfigured and where does he wake up if you don t get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today s pop culture society 
__label__1 i waited and waited for this film to come out the trailers seemed to be on for years it was worth it i m not a big fan of watching films over and over again but i cant wait for this to come out for all to buy not a big fan of jim but this suited him perfectly there was so much to see and the feel good factor is off the scale perfect for christmas i think ron did a fab job turning this into a film if you haven t seen it then do so if you have watch it again i know you want to 
__label__1 tales from the crypt and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth mary ellen trainor kills her husband joseph marshall bell she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac larry drake dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 directed by the one of the show s regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic the vault of horror was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt 1972 which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor this particular version is good enough but doesn t do anything different or special is a bit too linear predictable to be considered a classic at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace the story is just about macabre enough it generally provides decent entertainment i quite liked the downbeat ending this time there are christmas themed opening closing crypt keeper john kassir segments complete with the usual puns director zemeckis does a good job there s a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well there s not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someone s face is cut with an icicle someone s arm is cut with an axe there s some blood splatter but generally speaking it s not that graphic the acting by a small cast is pretty good and all through the house isn t the best tale from the crypt but it s a decent one all the same worth a watch but after the comic book story original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this 
__label__1 in the mid 1930s hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look how they should be structured and how they should be acted the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialogue this is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents for one thing many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative and were overburdened with title cards but what the informer has is the self assuredness to extend moments between dialogues to focus on reactions more than speeches and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere director john ford for all his capability was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material if he thought a story was silly he just did it half arsed luckily the informer with its depiction of community honour working class life and most importantly irish setting was everything ford loved and the result is one of his finest works in it ford only really employs too kinds of shot the first is of places the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths cannot be seen dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us the second is of faces striking close ups against plain backgrounds usually without dialogue focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him mclaglen s performance does not look like much being as it is about 90 drunk act but the other 10 is heartfelt emoting as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity with such performances are oscars won mclaglen is backed by a spot on supporting cast among whom there are no weak links in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una o connor usually only seen in comic relief roles playing straight dramatic parts for once although meek s appearance does contain one or two jokes the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedy rko who produced the informer were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios thanks to this we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti hero at its centre which could easily have been a clunky over earnest mess instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world 
__label__1 having lived in ontario my whole life in the same town that marlene moore grew up in i ve heard stories of her from my parents grandparents and family members so when i found out that they would be filming a movie about her and that the beginning would be shot on my street and her house quite close to mine i was excited if you read the book rock a bye baby which is about marlene moore you get quite the different image of her as a person she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child with the exception of one of her brothers also if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you d find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to marlene did not deserve the life she was given with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive it was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did i still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self defense from a man who tried to rape her as her brother once said they didn t know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her i believe in that with all my heart rest in peace marlene you deserve it so much 
__label__0 this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing in fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable having said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places although the editing was poor 
__label__0 this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series 7 this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark it s writing is lazy absurd self indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing i ve ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate i ve ever seen it s absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement makes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously 
__label__0 when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and wynona ryder i went through the roof but i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the bruise first of all the character that jeremy irons an actor i still admire even after this disappointment plays was just awful he treated his family like crap especially his sister played by glenn close i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and i m no prude but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down wynona and antonio s characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate and what was with meryl s character and her mystical powers why didn t they go into this more this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here 
__label__0 this is quite possibly the most retarded 80 s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features non stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other body stimulating fitness products if you d leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80 s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health freaks with a big safety pin yeah the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun bathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same spa you don t really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there s a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and charles napier look alike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80 s beauty i ve ever seen looking through the credits her name s dianne copeland apparently and she didn t do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma movie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the make up effects are nothing special neither we re treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway aerobicide a k a killer workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific double feature with death spa both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb 
__label__1 i couldn t agree more with nomad 7 s and i a hvr s comments a perfect laid back sunday morning movie the humor is subtle exact opposite of slapstick as one misguided commenter noted but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews hbo maybe had never heard of it previously don t know why it wasn t marketed that well when dvd s were released en mass it was one of the first movies i replaced a great combination of cast and writing plus the back drop of montana wilderness doesn t hurt things either beautiful it s probably not the type of comedy for everyone but what is if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley this probably won t be your cup of tea this movie needs your full attention the humor is mostly in the dialog i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off i m going to loose it ed o neill s face is priceless recommended 110 
__label__1 i remember this movie from when i was 12 it was amazing i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh t anyway the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch i must have watched it about 20 times it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off crash and burn don t watch that movie by the way it is total pants if your a real sci fi movie fan then watch this if it was re made today it would be a winner i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it

__label__1 perhaps the most personal of david lynch s works is his most accessible this time rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares lynch provides a reflective fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both the simple true story of an iowa farmer richard farnsworth who rides a lawn mower to wisconsin to visit his estranged stricken brother there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland filmed by veteran cinematographer freddy francis to make it an undeniable lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life and sissy spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by john roach and mary sweeney but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances one of the most notable being barbara robertson whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time but that s vintage lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best to those unfamiliar with lynch or know him only by his violent disturbing reputation this is an excellent place to begin for those who know his work this is one of the finest in his repertoire 
__label__1 reading all of the comments are very exciting but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast i realize that everyone refers to j j as the artist in the family but there was a real family that has the real artist and he hasn t gotten any credit in this sight yet so if you don t mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist i would also like to tell him job well done i know this sight is for the good times cast but wouldn t you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all i would like to know if he still paints or if he is still alive i would like to have some of his work displayed in my home 
__label__1 if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes ka den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didn t stop delivering what he s infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn t be ignored but it s not at all a fault of kurosawa s the material in dodes ka den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there s things that happen to these people and kurosawa s challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there s not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man child who goes around all day making train sounds the clickety clack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there s the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site specific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he s lost a lot more than he ll tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i m not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social around there are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there s the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there s a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it s about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it s a little post apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it s a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it sometimes there s charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawa s cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they ve always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them i e the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it s one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it s like the abstract has come full throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it s a brilliant tricky double edged sword that allows for the dream like intonations with such heavy duty drama with a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodes ka den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality 
__label__0 slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors the acting is horrendous however actually not as bad as one would suspect though it doesn t help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable the lead carol manning caroline munro is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she s the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for not to mention the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his so when he gets mauled does anyone really care there is much unintentional laughter potential munro s lack of acting talent is quite apparent which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast however the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro who is in her mid 30s at the time as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age the rest of the cast do not pass as adults this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking i ll get you with that being said slaughter high really isn t a very good slasher flick but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans but don t expect dilemma suspense or any credibility from it horrible 
__label__1 i know some people think the movie is boring but i disagree it is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person i liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of archie s life a mystery captured his humanity i don t think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someone s life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting and what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves men become what they dream you have dreamed well good job to lord attenborough i also wanted to mention that nathaniel arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and i hope to see him in more films 
__label__1 i remember this show from swedish television i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 s and the political climate of the 70 s when i think of it this was a real sci fi a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them 
__label__0 there were some scary scenes which i ve always liked more than straight out gore but otherwise this movie was rather weak there were too many questions left unanswered and when they tried to explain anything in the movie it was still rather unclear after watching this movie i still seemed lost in a lot of ways it sort of reminded me of silent hill a few years back that movie was also unsatisfying but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense this one not so much the acting for the most part in the abandoned was decent but the movie dragged on an on and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion like i said above there were some creepy scenes but otherwise this movie was a mess sorry i can t recommend it 
__label__1 magellan33 said you can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast member i assume then that you never heard of topper which in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast had a dog ditto this was the kind of program that had not gonna make it written allover it from the first episode it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play no one well very few of us apparently wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp 
__label__1 my room mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and i finally got around to watching it it is gross it is cheezy it is pretty dumb but it is also a lot of fun i mean this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since city of the walking dead ages ago it was like being at the old drive in theater again you could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies this one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one and it s neat because it is suppose to be like that the cheeze factor is high the gore flows and the laughs roll the effects go from sloppy to good with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good there is not much plot just lots and lots of gore this one is patterned after the zombie movies from italy and spain i think because they linger on the gross scenes forever like this movie if you like troma movies cheezy b grade stuff then you can do no wrong watching this one a nice way to waste a friday night 
__label__0 beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum that there might be a connection between the present day asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned at the same time there s an effort to present edward burtynsky s photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful much of the film is a slide show of these images they are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions to me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented industrial waste is still industrial waste the relationship if any between the photographs and the film s spoken message remains unclear i don t mean to imply that there aren t real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize manufactured landscapes however offers only strange and bitter hopelessness it s like a two hour lecture by noam chomsky maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what s wrong with the american and canadian left 
__label__0 a student filmmaker enlists a b grade actress a delectably diva ish molly ringwald to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull kylie minogue tried to make 12 years ago it s a curious plot choice to say the least as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors the film has a curse on it because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set but she s back because she needs the exposure unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set cut is an aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesn t bring anything new or exciting to the table in fact it rips half of wes craven s 90s filmography lots of film world name dropping a la scream except it s aussie name dropping jane campion see how this isn t as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la new nightmare the editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a well dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at don t worry we ll treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesn t mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump ha and molly s ridiculous one liners were enough to not regret renting this one you got any diet coke in here as she rides in the film professor s car and does anyone know where i can buy any tofu the first thing she mutters on the set and where the hell is my agent oh wait that s what i was thinking for her 
__label__0 many people thought that this is a good movie but i don t agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i can t see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the sound after a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long the summary is too short and it can t tell the reviewers about the story clearly in conclusion i don t think this is a good movie 
__label__1 this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10 10 for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan s movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time porn is watched for the porn jackie chan is watched for the action i think you people are rating it bad because there s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie was boring very boring but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that this did change the way how american action movies were created they have even stollen scenes from this movie if you want a true man a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan s hes pure in everyway he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park and even in todays movies american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do a masterpiece
__label__1 getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990 shot partly in the biltmore estate in asheville nc and the remaining parts in winston salem the massive offices of the rj reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the tulip capital of the world winston salem i enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the golf of mexico where renee russo and jim belushi went on their date i also had a big hand in decorating the bar where larry encounters the magical bartender mr destiny i tacked all those pics on the wall of sports heroes and decorated that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab i even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it i remember dyeing the grass at his old house with green dye because it first had to be sodded it was a new house in a new development and i guess they leased it for the movie then i had to cut that newly laid sod to make it look nice man that was hard as far as the movie when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of what if as good as i ever had seen it including the great it s a wonderful life i cried so many timesi can t count i got to meet the wonderful actor michael caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league ballpark where larry s boyhood scenes were played and replayed i remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer i ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite amiable and said why not he is a good guy and a really natural and forceful actor i can t say the same for jim belushi he was so full of himself smoking big cuban cigars and talking loudly soeveryone in earshot could hear his every word his career never did take off but he has had a decent tv career recently i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance it s wonderful and really heartfelt and real you can feel larry s pain after he enters into the new world mr destiny gives him after hitting the homer and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is they all think he belongs in a nuthouse but eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly especially his wonderful wife played so beautifully by linda hamilton and he wants his dog back so see it 
__label__0 here are some examples of pat robertsons dubiously claimed relatively good track record on predictionsin his widely reported comments from the january 2 edition of the christian broadcasting network s the 700 club during which he predicted that there would be very serious terrorist attacks and mass killing in the united states in the second half of 2007 host pat robertson boasted that he had a relatively good track record on earlier predictions but a review of robertson s 2006 new year s predictions undermines that claim he predicted for example that president bush is going to strengthen wrong the fall elections will be inconclusive but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in charge wrong the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion we ll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year way wrongfurther as a january 3 associated press article reported robertson has a history of making dubious predictions the broadcaster predicted in january 2004 that president bush would easily win re election bush won 51 of the vote that fall beating democratic sen john kerry of massachusetts wrongin 2005 robertson predicted that bush would have victory after victory in his second term he said social security reform proposals would be approved wrong yet again he claims to speak directly with god if so god has quite the sense of humor watching pat make a fool of himself again and again

__label__1 my comments for vivah its a charming idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom s families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is naively visualized but the sneaked in romantic moments between the to be married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressing v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the about to be couple waiting to get married playing by the rules simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of 2 families i think amrita rao looks very good she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti i e amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahid s bro sis in law it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesome stuff like sanctity in a marriage relationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially praying sacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah there s still some good audience who r going enjoying this film some of the folks audience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arranged marriage thats success if you ask me it seems amrita rao our actress from vivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006 hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah shahid or amrita didn t get any of the film fare other awards least this is news to cheer about congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bride to be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way shudn t forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar its no mean achievement congrats to amrita rao for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur they make a cute couple and their on screen chemistry reminds me of srk kajol or aamir khan juhi chawla some points that i observed few of the elements 1 if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film perfect fit 2 shahid kapur is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage but prem listens carefully to the step wise talk given by his dad having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible 3 in the entire movie there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together its unlike most other romantic wedding based movies where hero heroine are always singing dancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other 4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters girl kids in some parts of india 5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenes songs are beautifully pictured words like jal praarthana e t c are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love i cant do without u its a hats off feeling in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshness on screen chemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewing business than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those time pass fuzzy style crap movies :) :) :) :) :)
__label__0 the director states in the behind the scenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh t for mother s day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also don t cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood 18 year old recluse that s right he s been in high school for 22 years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn haha get it and his girlfriend just goes oh my god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing flips off cars and calling people losers the movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesn t if you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude 
__label__1 as alan rudolph s breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon s mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable it s surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughter house five mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why it s brilliant it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut s book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any author s work can claim that vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better endorsement than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s it s a mournful inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night it doesn t even take a familiarity with vonnegut s work to fully appreciate it as slaughter house five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema 
__label__0 my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes roughly after the tv report scene which i couldn t handle it went approximately like this reporter 1 hmm there s a pyramid in our skies reporter 2 i think it s aliens awkward silence reporter 1 in other news a few days later i watched it to the end and it wasn t as horrible as i ve imagined but there are serious problems with this about half of the plot can be easily discarded and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something what use are the detective the eugenics people and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus more amusing was the monopoly scene we re all powerful gods who have lived for aeons and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly monopoly monopoly even erich von dainiken looks coherent compared to that the other half is terribly lacking what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo frozen why was there no big event when he was released at the end he had those pesky followers remember what happened to normal humans what s the deal with the masked guy how did the blue haired girl appear what s with her eyesight etcetera etcetera visually it s ok more or less if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads 
__label__0 this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70 s when late night networks showed movie of the week horror flicks shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can t say that it is pleasant to watch nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can t fault her for someone else s poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but she s outside her range with this alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much this has to be the worst film i have seen in years 
__label__0 although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it s intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it s over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn 
__label__0 it is only robert de niro film which i really hates it is stupid film with horrible acting of course not de niro for me brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface 1983 or the untouchables 1987 i also loved de palma s mission impossible 1996 de niro worked with palma two different times too greetings and the wedding party i though that the wedding party was ok too i didn t watch greetings screenplay is really bad and unfunny there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a be black baby scene and also i don t like the scene where a guy s sexual organ appeared so it is one of the worst film i have ever seen just worst i hate that 
__label__0 a cast of 1980 s tv movie and tv series guest stars misty rowe pamela hemsley clevon little seymour cassel among several others in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax i really can t see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up 
__label__1 john carpenter s halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters unusual for a horror picture even more unusual is the non existence of blood and gore and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date get that halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance s career a true classic 
__label__0 we can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster having grown up in ny i can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people i m not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate this is a colossal waste of time and even worse is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad who acts this way nobody the writer s name sounds israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn t have a clue about the subject he is writing about looking at his bio it is shocking he lived in new york and wonder how much real connection he had with the community even mediocre films like a stranger among us are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck reading this guy s credits it s no wonder he has written scripts on all c grade films that somehow feature stars shocking perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad dolph lundgren film 
__label__1 what a night perry mason then have gun will travel followed by gunsmoke when it was a half hour and finally at 10 30pm came sea hunt with its wonderful opening theme music and mike s boat sailing off to a new adventure terrific regardless of the story it was the lead character played by lloyd bridges strong honest sincere a man s man and a boy s man this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years why they don t show on cable or make it available on video no idea too bad 
__label__1 i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a well written superbly acted and good looking movie

__label__1 chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy s anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by him many people that i ve spoken to about the sopranos who haven t seen it yet will say i m just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don t walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don t much care for hospitals it s not about the context 
__label__0 whattt was with the sound it sounded like it was all dubbed otherwise bad plot bad accents bad even dougray and we live in scotland acting bad harp bad sex scenes bad cringeworthy still we watched it until the end in disbelief how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly will they ever get a decent job again bad bad bad by the way we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot etc and to the older reviewer i totally agree it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s how did it get made in 2004 ok ok there were some ok bits they had a nice house in bristol dougray had a nice boat jennifer looked nice in a little outfit but how come the sister got all the men 
__label__1 after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller madam lili 1969 starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back it is for its time a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918 it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity 
__label__1 this could be a 10 if it wasn t for the quite predictable and hollywood ish scenario daniel day lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time why not the leading may i ask and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level i personally was impressed with hugh o connor who played christy brown as a child the very first scene i watched him was really strong wow 
__label__0 this movie was so bad it was terrible it was awful i cannot stress it enough the acting directing story characters and everything about it was bad it was so corny and clichéd don t be fooled by the cover or the tag line the texas massacre is nothing to laugh at are you frogging kidding me it was ridiculous the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan ok now turn it off what i got from the film was a bunch of ugly annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways this movie was a waste of my time and money and it would be a waste of your money and time too i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible i just wanted to see how each bad actor died and it still wasn t worth it just looking at the cover is a waste of time this is seriously the worst movie ever rating doesn t deserve one 
__label__1 a hot headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case andrews and tierney are reunited with director preminger in a film noir that is as effective as laura their earlier collaboration andrews is perfectly cast as the earnest cop a good guy caught up in unfortunate circumstances the acting is fine all around including malden as a tough police captain and tully as tierney s protective father the screenplay by hecht a great and prolific screenwriter is taut and suspenseful and preminger creates a great atmosphere 
__label__1 alright this was quite a sensitive little number but i can t help thinking i ve seen it before reminds me of another vca film i saw at poitier called the other days of ruby rae also had specks of welcome to the dollhouse and ratcatcher and lynne ramsay in it s execution which is not to say that they re not tasteful references just that they feel very modern and very fashionable which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising as an approach in style and story than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come the cinematography is just too perfect for my liking too coral filter or charcoal for my liking too archly framed 12mm therefore the entire impression left me a little distant beware of art that proclaims itself too readily the french they are a conservative bunch seemed to buy it as did the jury however but cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it s feature selection although i wonder what s been happening in the last few years 
__label__1 based on the idea from gackt moon child took place in a poverty stricken country called mallepa in a futuristic timeline the story followed the lives of the two main characters kei hyde and sho gackt and their friends growing up together despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship even amongst all the hardships between each character in the end each of them wanted to have someone on their side to have friends unlike most vampire characters kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy sho who s not afraid of kei regardless of what some might ve thought i see kei as a fatherly figure to sho kei was there throughout the earlier life of sho he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives on the other hand sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn t all about fun and games that death exists and able to take away his loved ones i love the part where lee hom the actor who played son first appeared on the screen the way they met up was quite cool indeed son also has a big part within this movie the fact that he s from a different race a taiwanese made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs they ve done great acting jobs moon child really made an impact for me it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes the movie shows a lot of hope despite all the bad things that happen in their lives that there s always hope life can be cruel that it seems hope doesn t exist anymore it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other even when son became the enemy sho did have some sort of fun at their last battle every single one of them desired peace in the end no matter how far apart they ve become the ending scene showed it to us 
__label__0 this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going and the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks morty is one of the most un scary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden statute henry freakin kissinger run it s dr kissinger that d be about as scary as morty and then there s a scene where the hero hits his father s tombstone with a sledgehammer you might guess a two by four someone might venture no he angrily beats his father s tombstone with a twig a freakin twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brother there s also a native american guy who lives with the main character s grandparents but apparently does nothing except morty maintenance he perpetuates creepy morty legends warns those who scoff and even fixes morty s arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rat s hairy behind no the movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears sort of this film is a real yawner don t rent it 
__label__0 i couldn t not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel trust me double negatives are required here it s that bad this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good thank you very much has a decent melody but the lyrics are stupid beyond words i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film s bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again the only entertaining part of this movie completely unintentional by the way involves alec guinness as jacob marley dressed in a silly powder white costume guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie albert finney meanwhile blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo scrooge finney s scrooge is so hideous a person it s impossible to believe his transformation steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs 
__label__1 i have always like this great baseball movie it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd also in this movie is ben johnson brenda fricker big tony longo tony danza and matthew mcconaughey also jay o sanders and dermot mulroney the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film s actors the baseball scenes are all realistic the music by composer randy edelman is very good and it fits the film very well some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities stoney jackson s ray mitchell character reminded me royce clayton mcconaughey s character reminded me of steve finley and jay o sanders s commentator in my opinion resembled how al hrabosky looks today this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film 
__label__0 all i can really say is that i m glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k 
__label__0 in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry capote coined the phrase nonfiction novel to describe the book on which this film is based and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script which he co wrote despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story this is the first problem with the tv remake color changes the tone of the story in addition the confinement of shooting a film for tv makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused as a result we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film police interviews trial imprisonment and execution so claustrophobic on the small screen it s just another version of law and order spin offs hollywood s search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age usually that s a mistake and this is no exception all of the actors are competent the script is ok the directing doesn t get in the way it s just that the movie doesn t work as well as the original precision instrument it doesn t hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward smith and hickock that the original film provokes at the end of the tv version we are left with the feeling ho hum who cares see the original first on as large a screen as you can then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967 wouldn t hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie i actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an
__label__0 i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award but after watching it it s easy to see why it didn t despite the beautiful photography the film is incredibly slow moving despite having hardly any plot the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents death in what may or may not have been an accident the film is never clear on this and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot but they re very short and don t really seem to have any point the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient but that doesn t make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure perfect metaphor for this film really the photography of skye is beautiful though but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed and it s infinitely better than this one 
__label__0  spoiler warning first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10 the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew s strange traps her friends are unbelievably nasty the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn t manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers 
__label__0 this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics the script is ludicrous the acting is over the top and it looks cheesy the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary meena kumari watching the actress who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released has the same fascination as watching a train wreck her ex husband amrohi wrote and directed but lacks the competency to execute either task well bollywood has produced far better films 
__label__0 steve carpenter cannot make horror movies first of all the casting was very wrong for this movie the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer this movies has no gore usually a key ingredient to a horror movie no action no acting and no suspense also a key ingredient wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it s sad there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny continuing the teen horror comedy movies and no one laughed in the audience i thought that this movie was rated r and i didn t pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg 13 anyway see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer that s the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary and seriously this is to you steve carpenter stop making horror movies this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre 
__label__1 if any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one i ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting comically with the police officers the ishq kamina song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag about i have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact karisma kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza she looks pretty in the first half and i ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date nana patekar was excellent as her father in law not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him deepti naval as the mother in law was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesn t have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewer s eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances sanjay kapoor was all right but he didn t have much to do shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy aish is mad hot however the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for aish but they won t brag too much about it after wards hum tum miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see 
__label__0 for years i remember reading about this show trouble with tracy in the tv guide cfto tv toronto every saturday morning at 6 am i lived about a two hour drive north of toronto and we couldn t get cfto but you know how it is we always want what we can t have well i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this trouble with tracy was all about did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role was there nudity was there suspense was it a comedy it would ve been fine if there was some promotion of the show at least i could ve known what i was missing but no the mystery drove me bonkers until ctv affiliate ckco built a re transmitter in wiarton ontario and began to broadcast trouble with tracy at the same time as cfto saturday mornings at 6 am one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at 5 59 and at last i got to see what the trouble with tracy was yes the trouble with tracy was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was talented canadian actor steve weston died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed part of me died too

__label__1 sidney young pegg moves from england to new york to work for the popular magazine sharpe s in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression based on toby young s book about survival in american business this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy but it isn t this 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story we start off in the past then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how young made his mark at one of america s top magazines pegg hot fuzz is too likable for words whether it s hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the english actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene here when the scripting is good but far from his own standards he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for his antics with babe 3 are unforgivable simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing but he pulls it off splendidly bridges and anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest megan fox who stole transformers reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star the fact that her character sophie myles is starring in a picture about mother teresa is as laughable as her character s antics in the pool to emphasize the point there is a dog and pegg rounds that off in true brit style comedy with a great little twist though a british film there is an adaptation of american lifestyle for young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the american professionalism the inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star s gives this edge weide s first picture is not perfect there are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary the physical comedy can also be overdone as a side note the bloopers on the dvd are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour long this comedy drama has simon pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching 
__label__1 it s very sly for all of the 60 s look to the movie the humor is quite gentle but it grew on me much more than i expected the cast is first rate and they appear to be having a wonderful time ustinov wanders through the film muttering some quite funny things under his breath and it s all very inconsequential i ll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd the plot is that ustinov as an embezzler released from prison posing as a computer whiz and embezzling money from an american company with an office in london maggie smith is his secretary for a while and watching her get fired from many different jobs is part of the fun bob newhart is his usual deadpan self and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive running the london office the ending is funny and nicely cynical 
__label__0 i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world but this poor excuse for a soft core porno flick is needlessly offensive lacks anything resembling wit and serves merely as a vehicle of self promotion for springer even though it runs a quick 90 minutes the film drags hideously and i should have had the common sense to walk out simply atrocious 
__label__1 after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian ken burns take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced an updated version of this series would be welcome the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original if you are interested in this era don t miss this series it is required viewing 
__label__1 the title has many meanings the boxing ring where differences and grievances are fought out a wedding ring where mabel feels trapped and jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble a ring like bracelet that bill gives mabel as a love token former professional boxer danish carl brisson was given his start in films by alfred hitchcock in the ring a very young ian hunter who went on to have such a long career in movies plays bob corby who catches the eye of a pretty girl mabel lillian hall davis at a fun fair she happens to be engaged to one round jack sander carl brisson but that doesn t stop her flirting with bob bob is persuaded to go one round with jack he goes several rounds and wins he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if jack is as good a fighter as they have heard he offers to take jack on and jack goes off along with his boorish trainer the great gordon harker to make his fortune with plans to marry mabel when he makes good jack wins his fight and marries mabel the next day but the deep attraction that she and bob feel for each other is still there jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight bob for his wife at last a boxing movie where the hero doesn t go off the rails bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion if only mabel acted in the same way she has left him for bob and the fight at the end is a mighty one it is intensely realistic it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film from being raw and enthusiastic jack is almost knocked out then between rounds reuniting with mabel gives him the courage to triumph the question is why would he even want her back from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with bob why wouldn t she do it again the film is loaded with symbolism jack shaking hands with the promoter changes to mabel s hands accepting a bracelet from bob when jack puts the ring on mabel s finger bobs bracelet slips down her arm at the end jack sees mabel s reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on this is an excellent film that will not disappoint you highly recommended 
__label__0 this movie really shows its age the print i saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better prints out there however this was not the major problem with the movie the problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion sometimes the characters backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly hide the fact that the film was dubbed well its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious it just looked cheap overall the film looked low budget and silly it s really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and or has no interest in women but in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess even with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat chunky hedy lamarr it isn t worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america she looks like 2 completely different people it s such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film i don t see how it has gotten such rave reviews for technical problems alone the movie can t rate a 10 or anything near it 
__label__1 ok after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis the lost empire i just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from nadia secret of the blue water the only part that was a ripoff from nadia is that the pendant from nadia and the pendant from atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it s used origins and how it s created from the source of life that there s no doubt about it being copied if you want to consider how kida and nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too it was kind of wierd for nadia and kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too as an anime fan i have to agree there s some degree of copying but it s only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original like the encryption design on the wall in laputa the ancient mask from princess mononoke the resemblence of the vehicles to the garfish submarine in nadia etc the plot itself i believe it s highly original and it s quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain nemo the main character in jules verne s 20k leagues under the sea which is also the main character in nadia as for mylo and jean wearing similar style glasses as shown in the novel lord of the flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence i think mylo jean the main character from stargate and a dozen of other intelligent characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses as for the submarines and how the submarines fight with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what nautilius does i want to state that it s a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot after all it s a sunken city beneath the waters as for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from nautilius in nadia it might be the artwork but i don t sense any copyright infringement there as the character s personalities were perfectly original to me as an anime fan that rated nadia as the 1 best anime i ever watched even now today i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview but now that i watched the movie i once again regained my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis overall the best disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it s a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better also it s amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing 
__label__1 i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators i e chinese it becomes a story about values and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life and loyalties toward institutions amazingly enough it managed to do this in a gentle mildly humorous manner which only in retrospect seens threatening to one s status quo i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could 
__label__1 yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great 10 out of 10 i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down 
__label__1 wwe s last ppv of 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans but for one reason only the ladder match which was only scheduled to be paul london and brian kendrick against william regal and dave taylor but with the recent crap ppv being december to dismember wwe knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again this proved useful when it introduced mnm and the hardy boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches i have ever seen but joey mercury s face was a total mess johnny nitro didn t even check on his partner they just carried on like nothing happened and taylor and regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots in the end london and kendrick retained the titles elsewhere on the show kane defeated mvp in a decent inferno match when he set mvp s stupid costume on fire chris benoit downed chavo guerrero in a decent match gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the wwe cruiserweight title in a solid effort but the main event was a total mess king booker teamed with finlay to take on john cena and batista the action was shoddy and no one cared who batista picked for his partner overall results kane defeated mvp in an inferno match paul london and brian kendrick retained the wwe tag team titles against the hardy boyz mnm and david taylor and william regal in a ladder match chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero to retain the us title in a decent match gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the cruiserweight championship the boogeyman beat the miz in a terrible match the undertaker defeated mr kennedy in a last ride match john cena and batista defeated king booker and finlay in an abysmal match overall grade b
__label__0 just finished watching can t say i was impressed it starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears not only do you recognize them from the band lordi but they are seriously malplaced in the movie doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80 s as for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole but there is no clear story on why and what is happening the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess with all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they aren t so the movie gets cred for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on stage monster aliases scarier 
__label__0 carlito way the original is a brilliant story about an ex drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it this film was i saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad but after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great lucky number slevin tokyo drift i gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes the script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare it was weak with weaker dialogue it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie so brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girl and she say s yes and if you need to act bad just throw racism around as we learn from the italian mobsters the acting was terrible to say the least i found hollywood nicky hilarious i absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies lets face it the only reason p diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangsters the actress who plays leticia was weak but beautiful the sex scene was weak but we got to see her which was okay but overall i expected it shed light on how carito ended up in prison and the love of his life and the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is carlito s way rise to power 
__label__1 i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea i think the dark heart character is a little on the rough side and i don t like the way he shape shifts into a mean frog fox boy i was wrong this movie was made for my kid not for me she gets it when it went over under my head of course i don t get it this isn t one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing there isn t any political junk ether there s no magic key that will save the world from ourselves nobody has the right to access excess and everyone isn t happy all the time and as a side benefit nobody dies russwill 
__label__0 as long as there s been 3d technology 1950 s i think there s been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i don t remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960 s if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in 3d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it s origin there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses this claim was a bad move because it s not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie 
__label__0 im watching it now on pink serbia tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this series this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in 1994 when it came out but the series some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no scifi the film was the bomb the series suck 
__label__1 this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions muti billion dollar computer graphics or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie all you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese films akira kurosawa pulls off brilliantly i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works 10 10
__label__1 the people who are bad mouthing this film are those who don t understand film to begin with these are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesn t star leonardo dicaprio wilder napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first but what it lacks in plot it more than makes up for in substance one thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it s use of music which plays a large part those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie both in vida and wilder s life and in the background wilder s theme vida s theme and wallace s theme are all heard in the opening sequence and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out for instance in the scene where the men are singing duke of earl vida is with wilder when the men sing something like she is my girl and then she goes over to wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric she will be my girl cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie and while it may look like a flop on the outside the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is 
__label__0 man i really wanted to like these shows i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these opportunites but sadly i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king as brilliant as king s writing is the irony is that it simply doesn t translate well to the screen big or small with few exceptions very few the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read many people would disagree with this but i m sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read the reason is simple the average king story takes place in the mind scape of the characters in the story he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view in short king takes the reader places where you can t put a panavision camera as an audience watching the filmed king we re left with less than half the information than the reader has access to it s not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed for as long as king writes hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor without any regard to whether or not they should i don t blame the filmmakers for trying but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works the task is akin to turning lead into gold or some arcane zen mastery oh well better luck next time 
__label__0 although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasn t what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don t eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a lose lose situation on one hand i still don t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don t eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely lose lose i m not even sure what genre they re going for here just early 80 s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non flashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10 i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now we re in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys don t kill them although i wouldn t have minded if they had in the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isn t saying much for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but it s stupid i guess i didn t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious b movie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don t eat the babies 3 10
__label__1 it took a long time until i could find the title in a special videothek in berlin and i was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles i think it s one of the best horrormovies ever it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy i must admit i wasn t able to laugh about when i saw it the first time and it was the same with the second time on the one hand trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact that he doesn t know who he really is his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie of course it s all in his mind but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in i think that s an interesting question his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and it s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his her window but this terrible cry does that mean that all will repeat again and again and again that his soul is in a cage or something and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff the fact that he she looks like a mummy in the hospital that s not an incident but a clue in my point of view 
__label__1 with this topic it is so easy to take cheap shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe not here adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine not only that but as geraldine he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric these are two characters who feel love for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially cheesy sub story line of corporate takeovers is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did 
__label__1 a must see i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious we re talking nonstop laughs it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty brains and serious acting ability peter cohen the director has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men s egos in the urban dating world for all of it s comedy whipped succeeds with it s intelligence which is so rare for a first time director especially with a romantic comedy he is a major talent judah domke brian van holt jonathan abrahams and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady s men you ve got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet s web check out the trailer on whipped com it s worth the 3 minute download 
__label__0 this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest in my opinion a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her and at this point i will say that these films are not real they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases for example when they kick the girl in the floor we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl and how stupid this looks the sound effects are also unrealistic and don t make sense other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours the ripping off of fingernails worms placed on the wounds in the girl s body the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig although it is not as bloody as the next part flowers of flesh and blood which tries to be as shocking as possible guinea pig devil s experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i ve seen and the closest thing to snuff there is this is still of course faked s n t uff the only difference to genuine snuff film is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s y and repulsive they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it i watched this as a curiosity as the other parts in the series and now i know how insignificant trash these are they work only in shock level and that s not too valuable cinematic achievement devil s experiment is perhaps the sickest film i ve seen and mermaid in a manhole guinea pig 4 is perhaps the most disgusting film i ve seen so these are pretty extreme in my book but that s all they are 
__label__0 sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attack such amazing 3 songs in promo dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss music wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandey overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english go away man i need to puke :(
__label__0 imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens then this goes on twice more the writing is flat and lifeless and jokes unfunny and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane 
__label__0 a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this film in fact what is the point of it the scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline the performances of the cast are questionable if not believable did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequel 
__label__1 i don t know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterwork the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you don t like the process of film don t like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramming this isn t a film that you will want to watch to unwind it s a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and care summaries may contain a spoiler or two the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions aren t real the film is like many films in one 1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lena 2 a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people he s supposed to work with 3 the film that vilgot is making it s about a young woman named lena ie 2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie 1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of that the magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellow blue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative another thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all i ll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great technique think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete tale think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didn t see that is a complete tale on it s own essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different ways it wasn t until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellow i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at film thanks for your time 
__label__0 one would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie this is not the case here i laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie and that wasn t even during the final comedy scene which one would also expect to be the funniest this is one you can watch when it comes to tv don t spend any other money renting it 
__label__0 that is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth s yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing british school oh yes it s like in the army you learn to obey and do what you re asked to yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life great basically that s how you could sum up the nice intentions in if nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges the result is a declamatory movie do you see how boring i mean at least that oldie helped kubrick cast mcdowell in a clockwork orange a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self indulgent sentimentalism 
__label__0 the rookie suffers from so much there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush noonan and leavitt just don t know when to quit it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid stereotyped japanese guys but it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters then it just abruptly ends even a naked julie newmar in a towel can t save this one there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing stick to martin lewis at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face 
__label__1 saw this again recently on comedy central i d love to see jean schertler memama and emmy collins hippie in supermarket cast as mother and son in a film it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made hats off to waters for making a consistently funny film 
__label__0 this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non latinos there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to delete a complete generation is inexcusable isabel allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read 
__label__1 in iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be corrupted by bad language close proximity to thousands of men and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director jafar panahi s offside follows six girls disguised as men who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between iran and bahrain a match that will decide whether or not iran goes to the world cup in a departure from the bleak minimalist films we have been accustomed to from iran over the last ten years offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in iran shot with a digital camera using non professional actors who are more than up to the task the girls try to sneak into azadi stadium in tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium they are guarded by three young army conscripts safdar samandar mohammed kheir abadi and masoud kheymeh kaboud who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules the women are soccer enthusiasts not political activists and cheer for iran s victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the vice squad and an uncertain future outspoken rather than acting like victims they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions making their absurdity quite obvious although they can hear the crowd noise the women cannot see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game one of the funniest sequences takes place when a female prisoner is escorted to the men s room by a soldier the young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside little by little to paraphrase adlai stevenson that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send iran to the world cup although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens one can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century 
__label__0 not one of the better pokemon movies two legendary pokemon come into the story you do get to see how strong celebi can be though he turns evil first suicune also makes an appearance he didn t seem that powerful the marauder didn t have many strong pokemon at all except for that taranitar some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better ash and pikachu meet the much younger professor oak though they don t realise it misty i was thinking had it at the end but she didn t get close i saw this in the credits don t expect much here the worst of the series so far 
__label__1 spoilers i loved the later episodes from college and on but i wish i could get the last season on dvd unfortunately the latest i could get is the first college season still the teenage years were sweet although they focused a lot on magic they also made her into a character that teens could relate to deeling with the stuggles of teens and children in divorced families this show was very innocent they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs but they did deel with pressure to fit in i loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her aunts to let go as she left the nest the older episodes were cute but it was just so much better to see her as well not really a teenage witch anymore but an adult witch i loved roxy and mortgan they were so talented in the earlier episodes the aunts were great actresses but they were so strict kind and loving but they treated her like a young child in some ways but not in every way i mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic i mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once that was what i liked about the college episodes she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything that was annoying not to put down hilda and zelda melissa joan hard is beautiful and was perfect for the sabrina with her perky personality i liked the last episode where she ran off the marry harvey but as somebody else said it would have been nice to see what happened after i mean i believe it was obvious they were getting married where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress but i would have liked to have seen it i supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house but they already graduated college sabrina had great job for a magazine and i think harvey had a good job because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end but they never say what he does as a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his dad when sabrian moved into the house that season they never really explain how it happened actually there is a lot the show does not explain but i supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery prior to sabrina and her friends moving into the house they show hilda getting married and this whole spell that ends up with zelda turning into a child hilda comes back in the last episode and zelda is there in some other form but beth is not on the episode but they do not show zelda s husband or what happened like did they have children maybe they didn t want too much going on in one episode i also liked hart s sister who played her spoiled cousin she was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up i cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air i still love the reruns also i don t know if anybody noticed this but in the earlier episodes the town was called westbridbe a made up town i believe which was supposed to be close to salem but in the later episodes they don t mention the name of the town being caled westbridge and i think they call it boston unless that is just where she worked also i wanted to add i found the episode wild wild sabrina where she is taught about the importance of rules to be insulting she was 18 and too old to be grounded i would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 and i think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did they need to learn the consequences on their own i think at 18 they know rules are important 
__label__1 dig is funny fun amusing interesting stylish and very well done knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told especially with such style and substance if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see focusing on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs alcohol and insanity if i did not know that this is footage of real people i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece the story is compelling concise and simply amazing 
__label__0 the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing 
__label__1 this movie is a fantastic movie everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing i know mr garfield was blacklisted in the 1950 s but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd that being the case why isn t this one a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr schmid s wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it if it ever is put out hopefully it won t be colorized colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 film would go mr garfield did a superb job of portraying mr schmid some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr schmid s disability but i feel he got it just right i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two 
__label__1 on sunday july 27 1997 the first episode of a new science fiction series called stargate sg 1 was broadcast on showtime a spin off of and sequel to the 1994 film stargate starring kurt russell and james spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg 1 originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o neill two l s michael shanks as dr daniel jackson amanda tapping as captain samantha carter christopher judge as teal c and don s davis as major general george s hammond for ten long years we watched the team battle against the goa uld the replicators the ori and many other aggressors at the same time they forged alliances with the asgard the tok ra the rebel jaffa the nox and the tollan they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even then as with all long running series they were numerous cast changes michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor daniel jackson s successor as the team s resident archaeologist geek was jonas quinn an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara played by corin nemec however shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go the show s original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg 1 in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six year old daughter jack o neill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason the ninth season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa uld and the replicators in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa uld as the series main adversaries three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re invention ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg 1 his farscape co star the lovely claudia black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran a former goa uld host and con artist from another planet a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o neill and general hammond for the last two years they starred alongside the sg 1 faithful michael shanks amanda tapping and christopher judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise alas all good things must come to an end during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in cancellation in its august 2006 after ten seasons and 214 episodes the dream was finally over on march 13 2007 what began with children of the gods ended with unending the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci fi channel in the united states on june 22 2007 in the ten years that the series was on the air it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek in terms of popularity in certain countries it became the second longest running sci fi series in the world second only to doctor who 1963 1989 and the longest running american produced sci fi series having surpassed the x files only a few months before it ended stargate sg 1 represents the cornerstone of the stargate franchise in 2004 its success and popularity led to the production of a spin off series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008 although plans for another feature film fell through two direct to dvd films stargate the ark of truth and stargate continuum were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future a third live action series stargate universe is also due to premiere at some point next year there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better despite the end of sg 1 and atlantis as continuing series the future of stargate looks very bright indeed in conclusion while stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci fi television franchises such as star trek and doctor who its still relatively new compared to those two sci fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many many years to come 
__label__0 while others may contend that by viewing other works by bilal one will better appreciate this movie it does fail in one major way it does not stand on its own the plot is a mishmash that is confuses symbolism with substance here s an idea start with a definite story then craft symbolism around it we start with two different narratives this female that is somehow turning human a god that is for some reason being judged but getting one last fling on earth and this mysterious john character who seems to be developing some sort of resort just beyond the bounds of the city why none of these questions are answered but do we care no there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story the closest we get jill and even then the development is spotty at best unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive which it is but at the expense of motivic development i would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture 
__label__0 the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it much like star trek that s because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now it s time to do the same for the twilight zone while i have scored many episodes 10 this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad the writing was in fact embarrassingly bad two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode after a while it s apparent that they are the only two people left on earth as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion usually the twist at the end makes the episode great this one killed it 
__label__1 this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film it s worth a look as it s far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all it s not a reality show i m wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that which lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bent while some decry the premise i think it s really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost whisperer and medium i think it s the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earl oh and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path i d recommend it it s not as strange as twin peaks was but it s got a serious kink to it 
__label__0 scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and company shaggy s voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows they ve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original i m not sure what they re on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isn t following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but it s not real scooby doo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might too it s worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes we ll see how it looks after two more episodes by then i ll have formed a much more solid opinion 
__label__1 this is the second animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call artistic it contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes i ve heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i don t think that s true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren t particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i d say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listen read there is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10
__label__1 it s one of the best movies i ve seen in the last 2 years i ve seen the premier in tel aviv israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn t matter who boys and girls straight and gays jews and arabs i ve seen the bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel aviv and jerusalem the last time i saw it was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel the most symbolic i could how ironic and he cried in the end if he s been touched and wasn t embarrassed everyone would be touched by the bubble 
__label__0 the brain or head that wouldn t die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s it is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self parody and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead ginny leith a detached head kept alive by machines i vs and clamps seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes shades of the under rated boxing helena the genderisms are plentiful and about as irritating as an army of angry ants the dialog is hyperbolic over dramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely ok but not consistent why have i given this film a 4 because some thought clearly went into it i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts today s audiences expect another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likable all considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s american pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash her lover is threatening to sew a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him she is understandably non plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend oh there are also some vague references to the 1950s 60s cliché about the evils of science run amok recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies o w not recommended 
__label__0 this is a truly awful film what they have done is taken a tv show which was never aimed at young children given it the george lucas treatment i e ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn t exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch especially when the models got blown up and the voice cast wasn t too bad this suffers from bad casting bad acting with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope ron cook as parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played after this travesty i wouldn t let frakes direct traffic the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family how they worked as a team preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters avoid this rubbish like the plague i only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported 
__label__0 the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i ve ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions and he succeeds at least at first a love triangle complicates the story some this really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren t the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didn t seem to help the film much either while i have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone it s bad and not in a so bad that it is good kind of way 
__label__0  absolute beginners was a film for the younger generation a multi time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled constantly hitting each note teen s problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow it could have been dubbed the moulin rouge of the 80s but it disappeared it made its very shallow mark on the world snuck under the radar and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section the comedy section or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn t need chain money to survive alas that wasn t where i found it but i found it watched it tried my hardest to sing along with it stared into bowie s eyes but found myself faded by the end did it not survive the test of time is 1950s london too far removed from our current society is bowie too creepy i think absolute beginners falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang but withers to a mere sparkle by the end absolute beginners opens with a huge number that takes us through the non gritty streets of london which involve theft nightly prostitutes on every corner dance throughout booze like rivers and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual sounds like a place we would all hate to be right director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl suzette played by patsy kensit these two have chemistry and while suzette looks like a pre rehab lohan to me they worked there was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like lava and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled i was ready but then something happened temple takes us out of the nightlife takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first suzette runs away colin becomes a pervert and bowie well i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain i can tell you that much temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger we learn about colin mainly but nobody else i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era also were they teens really they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s but maybe it was my tv character development thrown right out the door temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin s parents of which i didn t know it was them until after the film and a song which screams apathy great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands then if that wasn t enough we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going and temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme i didn t think racism would be on the top of the bill suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race somebody help me out here it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off to me the ending of absolute beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number that first part set the pace and temple could not keep up overall i must say that temple can direct a music video but i don t think he was quite prepared for the feature film i don t think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come it is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside i wanted some cutting edge work but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s but by the end it just felt forced i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to motivation by the ever freaky bowie in this film it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status i am glad that i watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning but he couldn t control his characters way too many and the songs didn t seem to match the final moments of the film it came out of nowhere and it was unwelcomed if this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning absolute beginners was a welcomed adventure but i don t think i will be dusting this film off in the future grade out of 
__label__1 if you re not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation what i love is the ongoing surprises it s not only once that you want one or more of the short film in new york i love you to be continue yeah some of the short films makes you curious some of them very short some of them longer some of them has it definite ends some of them don t most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city it shows many different nationality background many of it make it feels the same way where i have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries this movie explore many type of things you might have known but for all the characters it s a new things maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new meet new people feel dreamy sad but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home you might want to reliving it again by watching this 
__label__1 in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown which is a lot this film even goes back to before simba and presumbably just after the birth of kiara quite true to the first film lion king 1 2 or lion king 3 in other places is a funny entertaining exciting and surprising film or sequel if that s what you want to call it a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema with a remote control timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of the lion king they are going to start watching as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story which is what awaits it starts with timon s first home for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age enjoy lion king 1 2 :)
__label__1 a thief in the night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers i have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting god they just needed to find an excuse and blamed a thief in the night do not listen these movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation but they re also fun to watch in their simplicity they are in fact low budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing i had no clue because i really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70 s included low budgets all the time a thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical patty myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about at first the movie isn t all based around her until the rapture happens what it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves no one can ever blame themselves because they re always right just like these whiners who complain about the movie these people must be full grown adults i m thirteen and you don t see me whining especially since i was exactly like patty before i re accepted christ into my heart for those who haven t seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a christian movie instead of stereo typical everyone else is wrong movies than you ll enjoy a thief in the night don t knock it before you try it something new is always good trust your own instincts 
__label__0 i couldn t bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such and i think that that is a great description of how they behaved more absurdly unbelievable writing acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as pigface who of course has grown into a drop dead gorgeous 20 year harvard educated plastic surgeon but only to do good in the world not for the money and she beds steve carrel on the first date that s when i quit watching if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps you ll enjoy this sentimental self indulgent waste of time 
__label__0 a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon then other parts felt like some other movie i don t know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie it was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original the theme little girl bad assassin from leon is just tweaked a little the opening scenes are really good it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon nikita and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movie if you liked this movie then i can recommend leon best regards rick:) :)
__label__1 first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when and i must say that after seeing it i could never forget jennifer welles at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film but when jennifer made her entrance the first time i ever saw her anywhere i was sat up and took notice her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene she s involved in i ve seen most of the rest of sarno s films and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best sarno s direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see co stars rebecca brooke aka mary mendum and chris jordan both frequent co stars of ms welles and also frequent stars of sarno s work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives this film is sarno classic 
__label__1 this is something new there s a coup d etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator mentally unstable new hitler etc without repercussion from the governments side like say silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods oh and they still claim that they are being suppressed of course see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals how much more stupid can you get and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace holding the constitution in their hands and reinstall their elected government this sounds like a hollywood fairytale but it happened for real against the explicit wishes of the usa the documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of the action acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup the good democratic freedom loving benevolent usa who still channel large amounts of money to chavez political opponents also highly entertaining and exciting 10 points 
__label__1 like others i have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho mythology of the participants to the crime including capote himself as to capote i cannot forgive him for willfully withholding perry smith s confessions intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels i believe truths and facts capote reserved for his book which required for capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old mcnaughton rule capote himself could never write another major literary work after in cold blood shame and guilt in my opinion he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book drama to him both men had to die for his book to succeed the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment his actions and silence assured that ice cold conclusion capote s book is not truth it is not factual or journalistic it is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination what most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of capote s mind which may have been the most cold blooded aspect of all no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer blake s performance that actor is the nightmare from capote s dishonest imaginings so who is to say how the two killers should be played who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to do it now killing i agree with the few who see in eric roberts work a magnificent performance shakespearean in its range yet played with heartbreaking sincerity anthony edwards takes a much safer attitude mode to create a smarmy hickok but he is one dimensional and boring with only a few notes in his television range roberts is almost four dimensional adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body a frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do like leopold apropos loeb robert s perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man without hickok or a man of his particularities perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life given the freedom from capote s death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings roberts and edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama same facts some of the same lines from the case record but deeper more complex with clearly titanic psychotic stresses indeed roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is what many of our reviewers dislike about this film roberts in particular is that cold blooded killing isn t shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand that is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic interpretation of life and death than capote could ever create a real tragedy the actual cold blooded killer mr capote and his hypocritically artistic non fiction novel do not control these interpretations and performances if in cold blood and capote s effect on life literature and truth matters as much as scholars say then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth or a version of the truth that is not the rank cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of capote s own abyss 
__label__0 i admire kissing on the mouth for its frankness pubic hair cutting and masturbation especially from the lead director joe swanberg they weren t afraid to show trueness to everyday private occurrences unfortunately the film falls under the the brown bunny realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy yes it mirrors bunny with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely unfocused on absolutely nothing feet hands or genitals again unfortunately i can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity other than that it was a complete waste of time we quickly learn of a post college male female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex boyfriend other than that we are subjected to the every day events of their boring lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer for this all to work the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real neither work and it s as boring as watching someone drive for an hour i e the brown bunny the only actor that stands out is kate winterich and even she does some questionable acting the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching listening to again i admire the filmmakers especially swanberg for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower habits but overall the film falls flat it has narrations that doesn t fit the scenes too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder other than the soft porn factor why you rented this 
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are spoilers gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin heather graham and tom cavanagh only gray and sam are brother and sister living together in everyone else s eyes as man and wife no sex but just about everything else early on the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nitty gritty questions too when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3 way date charlie bridget moynahan is the girl of their dreams like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal that charlie accepts in one week charlie gray and sam are to be in vegas in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently charlie has an off the rack figure gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a 10 000 frock for her while charlie is zipping her in this down payment on a house gown gray continues to slurp on the latte i swear it was like a feed bag what should happen but woops latte all over the gown it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale s bridal salon with out a 10 000 mocha colored gown back to reality caesar s palace las vegas they have the high roller room sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist were do they get all this money gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink a thon were you guessed it they kiss gray remembers everything charlie remembers nada they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds gray gets the hiccups gray excuses herself for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets literally and of course one is you guessed it again gay the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver alan cummings named gordy he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned they become great friends this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office gray works at an ad agency this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not so private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar sorry no men says the bouncer so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag bad drag he was in a sleeveless black satin like blouse a string of pearls and a grandma s church hat no lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman the bar was also the straight man s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of victoria s secret models everything turns out peachy she goes home with her firm s client gray happens to be on the woman s account and finally does more then kiss for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray but that is for the sequel 
__label__1 this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day it s pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit 1 2 
__label__0 growing up with the beast wars transformers i wasn t very familiar with the original transformers and now that i have seen the awesome movie and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which it s based i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast wars not that i don t like the bw characters i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primal i mean autobots transform and roll out sounds a lot better than maximals maximize the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that he s a real commander more so than optimus primal besides powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus just look on the web megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series besides what s cooler robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars 
__label__1 i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn t know about this website and i didn t realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can t tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt the episode where starsky kill starsky almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show what to you expect of a kid at age 12 now i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i m so there just got to say happy birthday paul 
__label__0 i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch we were between netflix mailings and it was a quiet saturday night i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend from the jacket it sounded like a rip off of the big chill but with the all star cast felt it might be worth watching boy was i wrong not only was it like the big chill it was a rip off almost character by character the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt where have you been all this time role spoiler warning and lo and behold he remains behind to take care of the old place cabin camp kimberly williams meg tilly jerk womanizer matt craven jeff goldblum etc etc i found myself wondering why i m even watching these people there was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them how did unca lou even find these characters after 20 years plus it wasn t even funny except when perkins fell err flopped out of bed the first morning it was a sign and i missed it after it was over i asked my wife were there any endearing characters in this film are you sleeping over there she replied no i m still thinking no none i can think of 
__label__0 a painfully protracted maudlin and predictable drama my twenty fifth sidney lumet film garbo talks gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert ron silver who is son to estelle rolle anne bancroft eccentric feisty and above all an obsessive fan of greta garbo when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own track down greta garbo and bring her to his mother anne bancroft is in full on chew the scenery auntie mame mode here that kind of feisty ol gal that film loves where she mouths off to people and stands up for her ideals and ends up in jail all the time she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct and every scene with her is yuk yuk lame every note striking false the rest of the characters are equally as one dimensional but tremendously less interesting ron silver is flat as can be and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film he is dating affluent lisa rolfe carrie fisher but becomes smitten with oddball co worker jane mortimer catherine hicks and i called every scene three scenes before they happen that s the other problem one dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story but there s simply nothing here the film s pace is glacial resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot it s both plodding and uninteresting there are plenty of guest stars so to speak including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker imagine that in yet another highly inessential scene late in the film it attempts to make a halfway decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives but by that time none of the characters exist as real people and the film had bored me into submission so it functions as a case of far too little far too late the film is my twenty fifth lumet directed film making him easily my most viewed director but outside of a couple egregious misses a stranger among us anyone he hasn t plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks grade 4 5 10 c c 21 of 24 of 1984 23 of 25 lumet films 
__label__1 like most people i ve seen jason priestley on tv and i think he s great but i didn t know he had a sister justine priestley is simply mah velous as the scorned other woman good music intrigue and a death scene involving amanda s revenge on an abusive dr that will stay with you for weeks i ll leave it at that kudos 
__label__0 i had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments i was hoping it might improve what i saw was badly acted directed written this movie should never even have been released directly to dvd the lead character who is a bride top be from hell has an huge ice sculpture fall on her killing her she was such a revolting person i was not even sorry for her she winds up there in a sort of heaven was still repulsive i left shortly after eve longoria portrays her i hope i never see her again she cant even act she is just plain annoying paul rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud jason biggs no longer a teen is also present i do like comedies but not stupid ones about stupid people rating out of 4 30 points out of 100 imdb 2 out of 10 
__label__0 flame in flame out that seems to be gammera in a nutshell a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon i m not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci fi collection put out by mill creek treeline films it s a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast and he s not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at plan z the hope of the world and wouldn t you know it there s a scene where a huge shed is shown that s called the z plan building that was a nice touch by the mid 1960 s this country still wasn t quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there weren t any privates around good old gammera was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged that s why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship whisking him off to mars to save the world high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save now let s get back to the cold war like godzilla gammera spawned at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying flaming turtles especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said gammera sayonara 
__label__0 this show seemed to be kinda good kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong first of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time that makes it boring the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way i know they wanted her to be tough but shes mean stupid and a bad chief the crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way as stated above i hate it all in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed 
__label__1 something about paulie touched my heart as few movies do it is a witty funny yet emotional movie i m a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie i didn t see paulie until may 2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at ebay the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands ivy s company followed by cheech marin ignacio tony shalhoub misha plays an excellent part as the good hearted human you root for him all the way through the movie you can t go wrong renting or buying this movie 
__label__1 i saw this movie about a year ago and found it to be completely laugh out loud funny a real winner in my mind it had the underlining of a stupid comedy but indeed had an actual plot as well much like the hit comedy elf in fact it had a few serious moments sandwiched between hilarity when stiller shot black s horse an ordinarily sober moment you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics you can actually find common ground there as i m sure many people have done something they wouldn t want a friend to find out about lest your friendship should end when i found out how much people disliked this movie i was completely dumbfounded that absolutely terrible movies like napoleon dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on imdb take my advice and rent it if you don t find yourself laughing at least once i ll compensate you the rental fee d=D
__label__1 the only reason i give this movie 8 10 stars and not 10 is because 1 sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of kelly s character leaves much to be desired imho do love that dean stockwell quantum leap al is the little boy the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter s i m 28 and she s 4 so while the character is less iconic than mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement in every movie i have ever seen him in he always steals the show one of the best dancers of the 20th century it is no wonder paula abdul sampled kelly s moves i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century if you were to watch only one part don t miss kelly s dance with jerry mouse you will not be disappointed

__label__0 this screwy comedy seems very forced indeed the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script and as a result it doesn t really go anywhere the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn t all that funny and then when cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn t want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it s really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy it s really a shame too as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess considering that cooper made so many good comedies i recommend you see them instead 
__label__0 the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its best worst i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clichés on every level story line situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses 
__label__0 an executive very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life meets a boy with down syndrome escaped from a residence both characters feel very alone and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life with this argument the somehow amelie like atmosphere and the sentimental music i didn t expect but a moralistic disgusting movie anyway as there were some interesting scenes the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy and the interpretation of both actors daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne was very good i decided to go on watching the movie the french cinema in general has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema but because of that it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy the charming tone the happiness of the executive s family the cheap moral the unbearable laughter of the daughters the guy waving from heaven as michael landon really nasty in my humble opinion 
__label__1 before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carrera s sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn t make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesn t do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies 
__label__0 this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie sholay but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script songs music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew waste of money waste of time after making movies like rangeela satya and company he pulled a coppola godfather on us what were you thinking rgv anyways the story is though hard to follow is almost like the old sholay ajay devgan playing heero beeru sholay and ajay new kid on the block playing ajay jay sholay both bad yet funny friends help a cop capture a bad guy first later in the movie now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan in case you haven t been watching bollywood movies the good guys win in the end there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life 
__label__1 this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies eighties such as serie noire buffet froid beau pere all realized by blier however i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the waltz dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles 
__label__1 after some difficulty johnny yuma arrives at his ailing uncle s ranch to take over day to day operations only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold digger wife and the woman s vicious brother good production values a likable performance by mark damon and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining if not exceptionally deep above average addition to the spaghetti western genre co star rosalba neri is one of the hottest european babes ever to grace the screen here she s absolutely perfect as the cold hearted user and abuser of weak men damon and neri appeared together in at least one other picture the devil s wedding night a pretty good horror movie that s of particular interest for those of you that want to see what s underneath rosalba s dresses 
__label__0 now for the truth its very very weak storyline for a walt disney film its total rubbish when the robinson appear the films all over the place i was shocked how poor it was it like alice in wonderland gone wrong it feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it and they don t after that i sat there wishing for the end my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story the characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don t care about the ending you just want the film to finish its a film to forget and forget quickly if you ve got some spare time don t waste it on this 
__label__0 w somerset maugham s of human bondage is supposed to be a english language classic if so much must have been missing from the film version here phillip s leslie howard attraction to mildred bette davis is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post breakup retelling of a relationship from the man s point of view being a family lawyer i ve heard many such accounts the man depicts himself as noble and always correct and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man indeed unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker this is an uncomfortable movie to watch phillip even indulges mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity but the real high point comes when phillip allows mildred enraged and now of dubious sanity the free run of his flat with predictable results bette davis was attractive for about five years of her life but that period didn t occur here in fact by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the baby jane character she would play thirty years later i note how howard s character is always impeccably dressed and groomed it tells me that phillip craves middle class respectability someone like that could not run from a woman with a course cockney accent fast enough phillip is for most of the movie a student such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status an english raskolnikov as it will and balanced that by allowing mildred a modicum of charm 
__label__0 this is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching the plot could be a lot thicker than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type movie the acting leaves something to be desired though you can not quite place your finger on what it is this is one of those that you watch on late night tv perhaps on usa simply because you can not get to sleep watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it 
__label__0 all i can say after watching snitch d is please stop mr cahill it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research it s comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak i laughed at the part when mr cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion this movie was tough as an after school special who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from i suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related snitch d is the worst gangbanger movie ever made 
__label__1 ok the film wasn t going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on it s a wonderful life but it s just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing 13 you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs however it s an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don t think too much in it 
__label__0 i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all second the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before the things isn t funny in the movie fiancé hitting his girlfriend beatings the movie was way too long talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture like the lady singing i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here come on perry you can do better then this 
__label__0 i first saw the live musical at the denver center for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind blowing stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that i liked it much more than most musicals that i have seen on the stage the interesting thing is that you never got to see zach s face he was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production whe i heard they were making a movie from it i waited with bated breath but when i watched the movie version i was so bummed out disappointed that i felt i was cheated the movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character personally i would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived i would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it it will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy 
__label__0 if only to avoid making this type of film in the future this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story one might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive the viewer comes away with no new perspectives unless one comes up with one while one s mind wanders as it will invariably do during this pointless film one might better spend one s time staring out a window at a tree growing 
__label__0 wow i m shocked to learn that it s a small world and that we are all interconnected what a waste of 88 minutes john dunne put it much better in one sentence no man is an island the acting wasn t bad the kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin i couldn t follow it and the only real hero in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid i don t know i just don t get it oh well 
__label__0  this may be a bit on the spoilerish side i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed that of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a disney made for tv movie a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago it s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults plus it s got built in quality sequels but disney fying was not the way to go the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book it is a complicated and emotional story for kids there was no reason to make charles wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs w s as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that there was no reason to remove meg s glasses that deprived us of what could ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book i could nitpick for days about little things but i also think larger things like the art direction was a off take for instance the way they made camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth it looks like earth it has people on it that look like humans the skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing but something is a little bit off the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth that is if we forget how to love it would ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm i unfortunately did not watch the end maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well overall an artistic disappointment 
__label__1 i meant that in a good way believe me true to life it ain t the whole oirish thing gets kinda thick but you do enjoy the cast here flynn smith bond watson frawley etc all good i also liked seeing mike mazurki of course he played a boxer what else typical forties flick teeming w familiar faces and fast paced scenes one after the other flynn is fine as gentleman jim you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here i suppose but it s okay it s a cartoon and meant to please that s all the boxing scenes were pretty good ward bond s vaudeville logging act a riot and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times really alotta fun flynn was on a roll at that time and it s clear to see why audiences loved him outta 
__label__0 i don t know why i m commenting this stupid reality show i happened to watch a few episodes of a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something i didn t watch the entire thing though only like three episodes as i was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day maybe i m just bored today i feel sorry for britney i really do for all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity or she s self centered to the extreme she married the nitwit federline okay anybody can make a mistake and before that she starred this horrible show about her everyday life with him where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it no matter if it is in someone s face or into the shower as federline is standing in there she s babbling about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination i don t care for my part but i can t help wondering how she feels about it now when she s divorced and yes for her sake i m embarrassed but i shouldn t be she seem to live a pretty empty shallow life though i don t want to swap lives with her even if i could road kill tv if you like :)
__label__1 i wouldn t dare say this film is better than the original but it is very good in it s own right the comedy in this film is just as good as the original though there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them the story in this film is even more bizarre than the original but that s what makes it so great peter hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast the core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles i don t care what anyone says i think keanu reeves is a great actor i really enjoyed his portrayal of ted in both of these films as i did alex winter s bill i was very happy to see george carlin returning to the role of rufus very cool hal london jr who plays the part of ted logan s father does a really good job the scene where ted possesses his fathers body and hal london jr begins acting like ted is a great scene and he pulls it off impressively well i can t forget to mention william sadler as death he completely made the movie for me the rest of the cast is quite good as well if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series then i would hope you would like this film as well but don t expect it to be as good as the original i really hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading chris

__label__0 i don t really know whether cabin fever is supposed to be a joke or a film but as far as i know it s much closer to being a joke than anything else a few years ago the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre thus giving birth to the scream series a list was given in scream of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable and the characters in scream ended up doing exactly the same things which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different either full of irony towards the genre self derision towards the film itself or at least different in their dramatic process than all the old films that responded to the same tired criteria in seeing cabin fever alas many will see how unoriginal serious pretentious boring and even not scary some supposedly scary films are now even a few years later first of all this film lacks originality in a way few others do it has been said several times how little imagination horror directors have today remaking remakes of foreign sequels but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn t seem to be an hommage to anything it seems to be simply a ripoff whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film s story won t be once again we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties who won t think rationally when placed in front of a problem will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it not much excitement there either for the umpteenth time in a horror film they are tempted to kiss make love and just basically have fun all sorts of things that don t really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously secondly this film is unimaginatively serious every situation the characters are in every dialog every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying nothing in the way the film is directed written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible never heard of before flesh eating virus no laughs please i won t even bring up the acting since there are no actors in this film the cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director thirdly and this will strike whoever has seen a good horror film before the screenplay is absolutely empty nothing really happens some actions are repeated several times let s try to get help nothing makes sense either in the facts the psychology of the characters or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters in the end i will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it gallons of fake blood whether they are being vomited squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds never were enough to scare an audience such major features as screenplay ideas and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary if i wasn t considering it to be a total failure i would agree to reckon that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch yet being grossed out and being scared are two very different feelings let it be known i would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first why not from the 60s the 70s the 80s films made by wes craven dario argento sam raimi stanley kubrick david lynch roger corman william lustig john carpenter it might not only give a good definition of what is scary or self derisory horror but also convince viewers that new isn t necessarily better a good example related to the film is the few tracks composer angelo badalamenti provided for this film even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions they are below anything he has ever done before

__label__0 the message of this movie is personality is more important than beauty jeanine garofalo is supposed to be the ugly duckling but the funny thing is that she s not at all ugly actually she s a lot more attractive than uma thurman the friend who looks like a model now would this movie work if the ugly duckling was really unattractive when will hollywood stop with this hypocrisy in my opinion despite the message that it wants to convey this movie is simply ridiculous 
__label__1 the film cross eyed by adam jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them the simple yet attractive settings costumes keep you guessing about what you will see next you can t help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie i can t wait for his sophomore effort it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again bravo 
__label__1 it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films but i think it s the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku s yakuza opus the yakuza papers aka battles without honour and humanity in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic dark and gritty but it s also a johnnie to film and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur every two years the hk triad elects a new boss only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police that s the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that as in the yakuza papers there s a great deal of scheming back stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances sometimes all it takes is a phone call in one of the most memorable scenes i ve seen in recent time which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect election is not as action oriented as one might expect although it is violent and i m not talking about the glossy glamour version of hollywood violence this is dark and grim to s camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not if you re familiar with to s style then you should know what to expect the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate the cinematography is great slick and dark in equal measures utilizing dark hues brown dark green and orange while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it in the end election occupies a peculiar place it s not exactly a character study and it s not an action oriented gangster film it explores a situation the election and its aftermath but does so in style and is both realistic and romanticized the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather 
__label__1 many critics have felt offended that r w fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a human like manner connoisseurs of other fassbinder films however will realize that lili marleen 1981 belongs to fassbinder s women movies like the marriage of maria braun 1979 and lola 1981 fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black and white world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished concretely speaking starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play the city the garbage and the death 1975 which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title shadow of angels 1976 therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light switch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones in a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness they are mutually related in a world view based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well from fassbinder s dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they don t misuse them they just use them in the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two valued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a black and white logic

__label__0 when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is what do you think of such and such movie there are a couple of problems here firstly there is the probable chance that i ve not seen it and thus i ruin my reputation secondly i could trash the movie in question without realising that it s actually their favourite lastly i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion thus i find myself sat before the convent which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here more s the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittens following well worn clichés the convent focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked but you ll never guess what happens next a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition will any of them survive and more importantly haven t you got better things to worry about the only thing that saves the convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio s bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger it s far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the day glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered but even if they were trying i still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you d see in the buffy the vampire slayer tv show aren t really that scary the scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 of voters gave this a maximum score i mean i know it s funny but i hardly split my sides to be honest i ve had more fun in a dentist the convent isn t really a horror movie as such it s more of a comedy horror like scary movie or shaun of the dead but you re laughing at it instead of with it i honestly can t recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then i doubt very much they d enjoy it i don t enjoy the so bad that it s good genre i personally feel that if the film makers can t be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn t bust a gut trying to watch it yes it s a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive a rubik s cube for example the dvd box has two price stickers one for 4 99 and a reduced price of 3 but it was sold for 1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick sorry if you do like it but the convent really is a pile of unholy crap 
__label__0 in an otherwise good review loleralacartelort7890 says the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available it uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x rays and gamma rays space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares but it simply wasn t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief 1 2 hour or so passage through the van allen belts they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 1 5 rem and usually much less of the 24 men who flew to the moon 12 of whom landed 18 are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis roosa and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s shepard would be 86 
__label__1 watching john cassavetes film opening night i was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting he referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldn t be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy otherwise as he said what am i doing i couldn t help but think of his words when watching gena rowland s character myrtle gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario there is more to this in cassavetes film of course since it s about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has like myrtle gordon is the theater near the beginning of the film after exiting a performance myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle it s a touching little moment but it doesn t last as she has to get in the car pouring rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she s not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she s sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it s out of her system at first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and can t seem to stand being hit she blames it on the lack of depth in the character the writer what do you think the play lacks hope says myrtle but then nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to myrtle is all to real until she s suddenly gone cassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person this isn t exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence in that case because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene cassavetes doesn t tell them how to get from a to b in a scene and he doesn t need to there s a mood in a cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera work you know myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it isn t with the plot but she s haunted and is unsatisfied with her character s lack of depth and the tone of the play aging who goes to see that she asks the playwright and it starts to affect those around her too the question soon becomes though not what is the usual a conventional dramatist would make the conflict will she be able to go on stage will the show go on this isn t important for cassavetes even if it s there as is the question will she be alright perhaps going through such a grueling play as the second woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the play s lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that it s expected doesn t mean it s any duller than woman under the influence if anything it s just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from gazarra to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own posed questions aren t easy one of the real thrills of opening night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does we see the play performed and it s apparently a real play and we only know slightly what it s about when we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence and the improvisation of the actors i wondered watching how much really was improvised how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed he s on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen it s funny startling chilling and edge of your seat stuff some of the best theater on film scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does acting mean 
__label__0 i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
__label__0 i got a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek i have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to august s underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends reminds me of troma but good stuff i recommend seeing this under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or high otherwise just let it be recommended download for sure o and the killings are pretty funny like when the zombie rips the satan worshipers dick off and stabs someone in the head with it 
__label__0 i knew that evening was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a chick flick but that your companion would survive survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film there s a monty python film about a knight who just won t die he ends up a wriggling why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt she s not worried about having been a wide eyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderess obviously being a girlie film there s a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy heathcliff character i m not a woofter so i can t claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour he s a bloodless cypher as you might gather the main characters aren t much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse there s a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isn t the role of hamlet why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that face fungus didn t flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without it i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery if you re dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you d expect in a beach cottage apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action you d have thought that they d have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn t be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can t know is nearby but we do as the audience if they don t have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the director s excuse is that it is supposed to be a half remembered dream sequence another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didn t think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties 
__label__0 i have to agree with most everyone s opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit dead like me where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader i felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the godfather or perhaps beaches in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying it s a start 
__label__0 the best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of sonny chiba this movie gives you lots of him chiba makes speeches chiba poses chiba sneers chiba glares at the camera chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful pensive chiba drives his car i enjoy chiba as an actor and a martial artist but even for a chiba fan this movie may have a little too much sonny chiba it s obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him and no i wouldn t put street fighter in the same category because in sf he plays a ruthless amoral anti hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes here he s front and center almost all the time and he tries to be batman captain america and bruce lee rolled into one toshiro mifune and chow yun fat couldn t pull this off for the length of an entire feature film and sonny just kind of wears out his welcome at least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while the movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the american version and a goofy cheer viva chiba viva chiba that starts things on the wrong foot there is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing sonny or his usual english stand in apparently couldn t be bothered to do the vocals for the american version so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from street fighter even with all those flaws and the overexposure this could still be a minor classic but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy i m willing to believe that karate actually works if someone as amazing as chiba s character is supposed to be does it but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you can t really see what s going on most of the time it s not all bad there are some decent shots and compositions and there s at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the client s bedroom in a genuinely inventive way and as for the actual plot forget it for a bodyguard chiba s character is something of an idiot the screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him and his client in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them and after 30 minutes it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good also if his character was really out to destroy the japanese drug trade he d have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided still as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel it s still sonny chiba and he s still fun to watch i paid a buck to get this off the bargain dvd rack at a local mega mart and i feel it was worth watching once 
__label__1 after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind dorothy malone finally said good bye to her sweet sister wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role malone won a best supporting actress oscar the film she s in is not quite up to oscar standards but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk s capable hands there s an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson lauren bacall robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama with the accent on the strong supporting players stack and malone both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack too should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives the nominal stars have less impressive work to do but do it with their usual skill and conviction hudson and bacall they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding the use of color is particularly striking as it usually is in a sirk film and yet it doesn t preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast 
__label__0 unless you are petrified of russian people or boars this movie is a snorefest actually i fell asleep about 40 minutes in had to fight the urge to just leave the theater i wish i had a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening even silent hill was scarier heck even pan s labyrinth was scarier i m still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick to begin with i m very leery of movies that use pidgin russian like this one did in the opening credits it s embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends we all cringed oh my god hmm well luckily for me probably you too this movie has already escaped my brain i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no specifics just murky visuals that go nowhere some languishing now dead hope that anything would happen perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can t believe it got such great reviews here which is why i saw it ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well i give it a 2 because yes i fell asleep wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up didn t leave 
__label__0 this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine l engle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms l engle s work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuarón makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience 
__label__0 the movie had so much potential but due to 70 s technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film the book version of the film was much better and well conceived if it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book it could have been a very cool classic 
__label__0 this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k it s super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really don t know why i watched this 
__label__0 badly made dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gijón film festival everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i what was the point of even making the film the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly i am astonished that this film has been given a release very very disappointing and a waste of my time sorry terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film now that could have been interesting 
__label__0 i love a good war film and i fall into the been there done that category so i would like to think my review is an accurate one imho having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish there is no way i can recommend this film to you it started off with me shouting at the tv saying you wouldn t do that etc but i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so i chilled a bit but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud i was right there simply wasn t any logic to the eod scenes i just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger so much so i was left scratching my head all the time then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert one of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some sas wannabe contractors the sniper scene was just so laughable it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience it started with the contact right and went down hill fast if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the eod team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all you are just left watching and asking why hasn t it ended yet then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh another scene where you just wanted it to end it added nothing to the film then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched it defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline it was senseless and awful i still don t understand why they wasted time on it then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter pure comedy the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be i thought it was going to be stupid illogical eod scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death all i wanted was for it to end it was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid senseless action ish scenes there is no way i can recommend this maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn t make sense the only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high imdb rating which must be the 24 7 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good sorry folks it just ain t not recommended it will just bore you :)
__label__1 the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok in the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they re lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence anyway once his brother is killed 12 yr old arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brother s death allows him to hit on the kid s girlfriend arnold s parents don t seem to understand how to deal with their son they really don t even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timer nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle s ex wife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family s turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman s performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues 8 of 10 stars the hound 
__label__1 at first i didn t like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama but after buying it and seeing it it wasn t that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program ilse johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels in berlin and hamburg and record sales only this is why ilse wasn t allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music 1942 in which she would demonstrate her whistling but this is an excellent example propaganda inge and her aunt eichhorn played by ida wust goes to the 1936 olympics the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets carle radditz who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and it s love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking you see the nazi soldiers acting normal like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism the character was a butcher now soldier this was a subtle put down against meat eating late on in world war 11 herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they survive another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now it s putting the catholics down and hubert s best friend helmet played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ beethtoven more bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he s being told to leave we end up injuring him propaganda message the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it it injured him see by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma played hedwig bleibteu the same german grandame actress who played maria holst s aunt in weiner blut well later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical revue such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movie it s easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good swastika classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity be careful most of the time it s the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it then its a nazi website skip it go to ihf or german wartime films dot com amazon dot dee or german video dot net they are legitimate 01 23 10 mada a mistake it wasn t herbert s friend that got killed at the church it was malte yager s character s friend schartzscop 
__label__0 flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringe inducing dialogue at places no twists they think they have one but if you didn t figure it out after about 40mins you re not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll i don t mind slow movies but they ve got to be going _somewhere_ this one doesn t the plot wasn t what made this a direct to dvd movie that s just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy the as of writing 37 ten 10 ratings must be from people involved with the production 
__label__0 just what we need another remake of vintage hollywood cinema with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor 1996 this shows why we re running out of special ideas in making a quality movie ladies and gentlemen it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans things can only get more worse unfortunately bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of family funfare instantly even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater sad to say this is the more progressive pre millennium era but enjoy it while it lasts cause things can only get worse with time more went wrong with the all new dr dolittle it is absolutely plotless feeling too flat i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock we need more talented voice overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don t want to declare bankruptcy i ll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998 then again the original version wasn t any good either murphy s next project could be patton if he s not careful 
__label__0 this movie wasn t that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original it s directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame the acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting thats one thing i like about screaming mad george make up effects artist for the film his effects are so off the wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they re gonna get the movie isn t really all that gory but there is an extremely nasty eyeball munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot what mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn t too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time possibly if you liked the weirdo 4th installment my favorite of all 5 you ll probably like this one i liked it better than the matrix enjoy 
__label__1 set during wwii bedknobs and broomsticks is a fun filled fantasy adventure for kids starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who with the help of three evacuee children and a professor of witchcraft thwarts a nazi invasion brilliantly inventive with loads of laughs this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters exciting story and catchy tunes lansbury is perfect as eglantine the not quite perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime and her three young co stars cindy o callaghan roy snart and ian weighill are equally impressive as the cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty hun the special effects are somewhat dated but let s face it kids don t care too much about these things so long as they are entertained and entertained they will be with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry potters it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism in fact only a rather drawn out musical number set in portobello road mars the film s perfection but with so much else to enjoy that can easily be forgiven and besides any film featuring uk television legend bruce forsyth as a flash harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me 
__label__1 all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done it may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way would you expect perfection in hell it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose it was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get i hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori i don t think lady death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong no pun intended 
__label__0 i don t think i ve ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing s there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half formed story lines the characters weren t well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and i m just here to warn you all of that 
__label__0 anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after 40 min as my wife and i did the ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand waiving arguments and the absurd conclusions drawn without even an attempt at a logical reason from real science i m offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of science i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book didn t understand a word of it then watched the matrix about a thousand times and proceeded to write this movie for example the washington dc crime experiment was done by the transcendental meditation program a brief search will reveal the science of their methods http www freedomofmind com resourcecenter groups t tm dissenter htm save your money

__label__0 this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black man s vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies aren t a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs i m surprised it s gotten such a high rating on imdb

__label__0 an attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don t appreciate opera exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time it fails badly all that is desirable in this movie is the opera and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten like most opera stars pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one who knows except those involved do we need to know the plot is weak and trite this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti and this one isn t one of them just get one of his many superb opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited it would be one of imdb s 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice however effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script i give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of pavarotti s singing and of opera because of this movie 
__label__0 words fail me this film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight i really wish i hadn t done it although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i couldn t last for more than hour so my opinion could be unfair however this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious please do not watch any part of this film 
__label__0 you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into yet again which on its own would be depressing but here it s overkill the idea that it s not a medical condition not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug some doppelgangers have super powers but others don t or don t know they do it seems they re just as clueless as we are it s a poor man s rip off of invasion of the body snatchers with keifer sutherland s mirror and the sixth sense were you to seriously botch those three together 
__label__0 i notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the mst3k airing that s fair enough that is after all how it got its widest exposure but having had the misfortune of seeing final justice in its original form i d just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version first off it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the mst3k broadcast owing primarily to an expository scene between rossano brazzi and venantino venantini i could use the characters names instead of the actors but i just love typing the words venantino venantini explaining why venantini s fugitive character can t just leave malta right away it s not a very convincing plot point but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn t provide much fodder for riffs i don t know another plot point missing in the original the stripper s betrayal of venantino venantini to joe don baker seemingly unmotivated in the mst3k version is explained by an earlier extremely unpleasant scene in which venantini rapes her in the shower while this does give her a motive for turning against him the whole scenario is just really icky there s no other word for it some of the mst worthy moments the perpetual truncated shouts of son of a and the deja vu shooting of the sheriff were purely the result of the edited for tv print they worked with and were absent from the original movie one scene i wish had made it into the mst3k version before entering the bar to question some people joe don asks the maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside because they see that uniform they won t cooperate however joe don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy slash sheriff outfit complete with shiny badge i can t imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him one final observation on the original uncut version of final justice why oh why did they feel the need to put venantino venantini s naked butt up on the screen 
__label__1 the sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch it s smart it s quirky it s funny and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can t resist watching the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families for most of the time you really don t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities these are dangerous men most of them murderers but by god if you don t love them too i ve laughed at their wisecracks been torn when they ve made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show s subtext people aren t always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds if you haven t already you most definitely should

__label__1 sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés but it s entertaining and that s what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty can t be disguised as for michael vartan i m sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i don t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see olivia d abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if d abo s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadn t really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception it s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube that s why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey i m a sentimental guy who tears up easily don t get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those i give it 9 10 only because i m saving my 10 10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think you ll like it 
__label__1 probably the best film of the year for me this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla emmanuelle devos who spends her days doing other men s jobs uncredited and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as being partially deaf she reads lips a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul vincent cassel as her assistant the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film mutual dependency for vastly different reasons bonds them carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for what seems like the first time paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas skill of reading lips i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance she won the french cesar for best actress you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting this really is carla the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive i loved this film because of these two people and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again 
__label__1 i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing everything about this movie seemed to click the storyline the characters the setting as far as film is concerned i wouldn t call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic it gets it s meaning across the cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie corben berbson fred gwynne ruben blades and ed o neil are hilarious for this who haven t seen it i will give you a brief synopsis four criminals meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of oceans eleven only with four criminals who can t stand each other and in montana rather than las vegas all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie 
__label__1 i grew up watching and loving this cartoon every year i didn t think they would be able to take a half hour 20 min cartoon and make it a movie they did it with flying colours fabulous funny heart warming effective movie 
__label__0 this is a bad bad movie i m an actual fencer trust me when i say that this film s pretension of accuracy is just that this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 s pop the ending is predictable and the movie is a bore from start to finish horrible 
__label__0 i can t believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie that s all i ve got to say the movie speaks for itself 
__label__1 as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 mbb bo 105 flight scenes in this movie one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod in this case an inert rb 75 maverick missile painted black with the letters ews 39 in white along the side real jammer pods definitely do not look like that at least not the ones i ve seen but apart from that it s an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending the last minute anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units including the now legendary ssg on film should see this one 
__label__0 how many centuries will pass until the japanese asian horror films abandon the long haired ghost woman shtick admittedly they ve managed to rip off ringu a million times and often it worked well which just goes to show that originality isn t that much of a requirement in the horror genre or that i m very uncritical and easy to please however this time around i found myself a little restless somewhat bored it s not a bad film but it s at least half an hour longer than it should be with its absurd 110 minutes length compared to many other japanese horror films omc lacks atmosphere and excitement plus the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all as for the ring tone miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing even though it was played a dozen times i can t even remember it that s how scary it was speaking of miike for him this is something of a commercial venture so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the bijita q or audition kind they re wasting their time 
__label__0 amy heckerling s second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930 s gangster films made in the warner brothers tradition michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 keaton s mother maureen stapleton has continuing health problems so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle meanwhile the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin yeah that s right vermin griffin dunne is keaton s younger brother turned district attorney glynnis o connor his wife and marilu henner plays keaton s moll the film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny piscopo does the once bit one time too many several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito dom deluise ray walston as a street vendor alan hale jr as a desk sergeant and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film i think heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties actual 1939 release date 1 2 of 4 stars 
__label__1 on the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn t appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn t about football it is about discrimination and the women s enthusiasm for the sport they love the film opens on the day of a crucial world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain a girl is trying to get in to tehran s azadi stadium by dressing like a boy it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who s leader would rather be back home tending his livestock we never learn the character s names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary as well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the disguise one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer the girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in germany the soldiers aren t shown as fundamentalists they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can t watch men s sports don t seem that convinced by their own arguments it is a shame that this film can t be seen in iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary iranians aren t a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere the cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures 
__label__1 i enjoyed the night listener very much it s one of the better movies of the summer robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable it s a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience s imagination but this is a minor quibble 
__label__1 dear readers the final battle between the rebellion and empire the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance luke skywalker now a jedi knight returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia now revealed as luke s twin sister they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy it s got action drama romance great battles fantastic acting amazing fight scenes and awesome music by john williams mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight gone is the naive farm boy and in his place is a calm relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando 3p0 r2 and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema s greatest villain darth vader ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty john williams s score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels signed the constant dvd collector
__label__0 i liked how this started out featuring some decent special effects especially for a film 50 years old there was some pretty impressive scenery however the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis altaira morbius viewing this in the 90s after a long absence it was fun to see francis again an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released and is still acting it also was interesting to see a young looking leslie nielsen dr john j adams who i wouldn t have recognized had it not been for this voice i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep i appreciated them re doing this vhs tape in stereo but it was a weak effort this is one those overrated film where elites think is so heavy and thought provoking that s nonsense it only appeared intelligent because the rest of the 50s sci fi films were so stupid some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen which i didn t have at the time of this writing perhaps another look this time on the 2 35 1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review 
__label__1 look this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself i remember that the early 80 s were a time of uncertainty the economy was weak communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty out of that confusion came a hero stroker ace ned beatty s performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness his triumph is an inspiration to all the on screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer jim nabors is a poet go see this movie tonight 
__label__0 unless somebody enlightens me i really have no idea what this movie is about it looks like a picture with a message but it s far from it this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems and that s basically all when that agent is played by pacino one must think that it must be something important but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is to one of the best actors in the world al pacino this is the second movie of the year the other is simone that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year so what s going on al 
__label__0 before i start let me say that i fully believe in god i believe in heaven and in hell kay now that thats out of the way i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves hosts think they are doing the last time i checked a host doesn t discriminate spew hatred filled rants on tv or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel all of these that crazy idiotic conservitive bible thumping fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily i am all for free speech but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many problems one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn t give us any work and we against many of us s will watched 700 s club and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he s right wtf seriously if the host is trying to make people think that someone else s sexual orientation is a huge sin then they seriously need to take that host duct tape them and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic 
__label__1 based on neil simons play of the same the odd couple tells the story of best friends felix unger jack lemmon and oscar madison walter matthau who end up sharing oscars massive bachelor pad after felix tries to kill himself he had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram she calls oscar and lets him know what happened felix turns up at oscar s during his weekly poker game with their friends vinnie john fielder murray the policeman herbert edelman roy david sheiner and speed larry haines after some side splitting hysterics it s agreed felix will stay with oscar the rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters as well as looking at if oscar can stand felix s truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if felix can stand oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys highs lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship with great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great monica evans and carole shelley as the british pigeon sisters who oscar invites over for a double date this one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and jack and walter are fantastic with a great chemistry also made into a successful and equally funny tv series with jack klugman as oscar and tony randall as felix 
__label__0 just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid if your child likes this film you d better have him her tested i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad this film is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else the writing is horrid i can t remember when i ve heard such bad dialogue the songs are beyond wretched the acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much who decided to employ joey fatone he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin the worst thing is the obviousness of it all it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible great children s movies are wicked smart and full of wit films like shrek and toy story in recent years willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past but in the continual dumbing down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo yes that s right the recent charlie the chocolate factory and eye crossing trash like red riding hood 
__label__1 basic meaning of the story is a reality cruel true reality situations are very funny you have to laugh when you see how people can be stupid obstinate and crazy the best description will be if you watch it on your own 
__label__0 this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you ve seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it isn t something you re likely to remember a while it is best seen while you re cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly isn t something you sit down with friends to watch unless you re all just drunk and don t care the mass rating of 3 2 is probably fair i don t think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film 
__label__1 i can t really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think it s only just in the category there s nothing sinister in this piece and that s where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hints there s no attempt made to question reed s motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out that lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end the story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you don t remember it from years ago and then putting away 
__label__0 this movie was terrible the plot sucked the acting was bad the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out i wish i had the time i spent watching this movie back the balloon scene was stupid the mormon jokes are really old the soundtrack sucked i saw no chemistry between the two leads it s full of stereotypes stupid local celeb cameo s most noted was del i m going to drive as fast as i want to computer idiot what is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up this movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream lds beliefs into hollywood i e the rm church ball etc etc i would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall you will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show 
__label__0 i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve king s three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romero s dreadfully static and unbearably cringe like script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia 80s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for 10 minutes about how he s committed to his great community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedy s speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy set up that s full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesn t even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornick s direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludge like creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah you re reading that right floating on the water finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but she s is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hit s a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough she s being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker not awful but i really didn t get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid make up effects are well displayed and dripping with vision when she hit s the hitchhiker that s when it becomes hectic cheesy and over the top in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly well conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel 
__label__1 well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it s greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself great i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i don t like them much terrific
__label__1 i read a few reviews of this tv movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment i agree that perhaps the film goes on a bit too long 2h30 would have been enough but i certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter jim jones expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner the movie takes its time in showing how jones recruited followers brenda vaccaro s and brad dourif s character are stand outs in that matter but also in observing an uncanny shift in jones perception of reality it is mind boggling to see an egalitarian left wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator perhaps the movie doesn t explore jones motivations enough which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times may have to do with censorship as well but powers boothe s mesmerizing performance makes it all come true i am not familiar with the details of the real jim jones life but boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real the movie features many strong scenes among them the preaching messes of jones jones s meeting with father divine a remarquable james earl jones congressman leo ryan ned beatty s visit to the guyana camp and of course the suicide scene it is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and boothe is quite commanding in those last moments madge sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower and so do veronica cartwright as jones wife and brad dourif especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion the relative calm of the end of this scene the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one s mind a disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses worth watching if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century not to let it be repeated again like ironically the inscription in jim jones camp those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it 
__label__0 this remake of the 1962 orginal film o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch deniro is a superb actor dedicated to giving his all in the work he does however he needs direction to focus his talent and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film gregory peck s cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch even with as few lines as this nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzo s oil but is not on the same form as weeds joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation some good points the start credits the first view of cody s back when doing dips in the prison the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats sam bowden s decent into full fledged panic cody s outwardly calm but unnerving prescence the worst the cleaning woman but not really part clinging bare handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed are there no speed bumps in the us the he s dead but not really parts and the aforementioned rambling ending i may watch the original again but i ve yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it 
__label__1 this is the best of shelley duvall s high quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick s prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although i m not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve martin s comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the show s flow as is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much 
__label__1 while browsing the internet for previous sale prices i ran across these comments why are they all so serious it s just a movie and it s not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it i ve shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is racy big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much it s worth 
__label__1 saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it i m a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal climatic happened in a scene i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter s boyfriend and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn t seen in ten years and with the gunshot signal two shots and then one she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch the reason she left town in the first place all at the same time the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50 s love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the bunny hug is good enough reason to rent this film on dvd one of the best films from that period i ve seen in a long time 
__label__1 tcm is keeping me awake all the time they keep coming up with films ive never heard of senso now ossessione a very early film by visconti wow the italian version of the postman always rings twice brilliant beautifully acted and directed never heard of either leads who were excellent clara calamai as giovanna and especially massimo girotti as gino what a sensual man more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 his look was ahead of its time many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him he should have been a major world wide star the film is much better than the jack nicholson jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version which i really like with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit who can forget this italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it im going to buy it 
__label__0 michael bennett and nicholas dante s broadway show ran for years but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation which most likely stems from the choice of director richard attenborough as far from b way as you could get and lead actor michael douglas who plays a director choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer the slim story about a grueling audition for a broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor dancer singers is pushed right up on us with loud brassy talents playing to the rafters nothing is modulated or subtle particularly a laughable subplot about a ex dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old flame douglas the over eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing this matched with attenborough s sluggish pacing spells disaster and even the now famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping 1 2 from 
__label__1 the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series however spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit sorry of the comic with a modern twist i m sorry it didn t materialize into a series sam flash gordon jones was a perfect spirit nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek deep space nine years later maybe with the release of frank miller s big screen version of the spirit more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s although all copies i ever saw were badly edited heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon :D
__label__1 i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies it is filled with super surfer greg noll s home movies and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50 year passion nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory it is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic surfers are not astronauts nor test pilots nor are they surgeons perhaps or ph d s again perhaps it believes in the quest of the surfer it believes in the beauty of human goofiness it believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before it celebrates the down time of a country which fought a cold war instead of a hot war with the russian socialists surfing is the ultimate narcissism it is dangerous but only slightly historical i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received this movie has no military heroes it has no guns the only beach head surfers conquer has a beer stand and and a surfboard shop this is not a problem peace is not desperate it is the joy of exhalation 
__label__0 i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally self important i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch a e and they would probably be alot more objective about it i dont recommend it period 
__label__1 it s very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline it s a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i don t like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because it s so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion it s the best film of 1991 
__label__1 being a transplanted new yorker i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created for example there s a reference to woerner s restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat there is or was a woerner s restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts no surprise because the script was co authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story mushrooms and at the end it s reached inside city hall itself al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself he s the outsider here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he bargained for danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal he s very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do aiello in city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever he s on al pacino s best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part he s a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended 
__label__0 everyone in this movie tells raffy carruthers how talented she is what a great director she ll one day turn out to be etc i think they re just being nice even kimble rendall who directed this film shows more talent than she does the next jane campion they call her and even apart from the fact that they re both over rated the two have so much in common they both direct movies they re both women they re both australian well give or take yep it s one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant and we just have to swallow hard and accept it but i ll say this for carruthers she s cute and fascinating no really here are some thoughts on her lack of talent 1 part of a director s talent lies in dealing with people why is carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed i expect 2 why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen after all it must have been filmed on a real movie set how could they get it wrong if rendall s set was half as much of an under staffed shambles it s a wonder he completed his film at all 3 carruthers the fictional director has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick fat chance i doubt it can be done these days i suspect that rendall the actual and more talented director set himself the same task realised it couldn t be done and settled for sigh knowing parody instead of course it s not enough of a parody to work as a parody as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did well less badly 4 and yet and yet the film opens with not a parody but an honest to goodness pastiche of 80s horror starring this is too good to be true molly ringwald this pastiche is much better than anything that follows it s a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie within the movie rather than the movie yet it too was filmed in the late 1990s perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean it 5 i d never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents but now i know and strangely i m glad i know a need i never knew i had has been fulfilled :(
__label__0 high heels are tricksy things they can elevate women or cross dressing men to newfound heights put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance alternatively they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips falls and ultimate tragedy tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser almodóvar s mother daughter drama is stylish for sure but in terms of plot it s a tongue tied and tedious affair full of confusing complex characters that never fully engage or make sense a few moments of comedy aside tacones lejanos just isn t interesting the best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child from this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up but then the film comes to a heel there s solid enough acting performances and there s some stylish arty direction that you d expect from almodóvar but otherwise tacones lejanos isn t an impressive piece of spanish cinema with a story of murder showbiz femininity fractured mother daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse instead it s poor high heels stumbles for sure 
__label__1 harman and isings old mill pond is a true masterpiece of the art of animation the consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is and was always intended to be a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people if anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race i have not been able to view this confection for many years as the race commissars in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would dearly love to view this masterpiece again i think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons which are after all sixty years old should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past 
__label__0 sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful actress anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer it s an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there s absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don t bother with this one 
__label__0 i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film the road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line 50 dollars you drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could so i declined to take this speaking part on i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as i ll be back and quite frankly my dear i don t give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as heavy 1 instead of the name of ryszard janikowski as time goes on i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film even though i spent a whole day on the set in south wales hot spot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if i d ended up naked in this most dreadful of films still on the positive side i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break i had no idea who he was as notting hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be welsh made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production 
__label__1 this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can t help but amuse and entertain there are tanks helicopters machine gun battles grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren t good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one danny trejo and if you don t know who danny trejo is then you probably won t like this film 
__label__0 i watched this movie last night on one of the pay per view channels and while watching it i quickly wondered why i bothered in all honesty i really did expect something more from this film maybe something along the lines of conspiracy theory why maybe because of the casting i mean nicolas cage and harvey keitel after all not to mention jon voight and christopher plummer now i m wondering why did they bother but instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama i was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a là the goonies which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise perhaps it s because the goonies was clearly targeted toward the pre teen and teen audiences whereas national treasure judging from the previews was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience suspension of disbelief is one thing it s how one can enjoy sci fi and horror but i found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracy laden tripe being shoved at the audience oh the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment wow the masons the knights templars you know this could really be true i think the writer really lost me when gates said the founding fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the british and just were did the knights templar come from new jersey oh i forget from france which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in philadelphia during the revolution it was brought there by agents of napoleon anyway you see what i m getting at the premise of the movie is interesting and i really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama but it just comes off as another kid flick in grown up clothing in the end i think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree i ve just finished watching several items by werner herzog and istvan szabo it s a shock to switch from fine dining to hollywood big mac and fries okay okay if you pant over chases explosions and gee whiz gimmickry you ll enjoy national treasure but it s the sort of movie well have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out and all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like wow did you see how that thing blew up that was so cool national treasure is that kind of movie 
__label__0 so i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going wtf just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays it made me laugh but i wouldn t watch it again and i m very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but don t think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin or superbad 
__label__0 this engaging which it shouldn t be low grade spanish exploitation quite tame i might add looks good but huh let me phrase that again huh actually the word huh would be going through your mind quite a lot nothing makes sense nor does it try too i just don t know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle but there s no denying how laconically uneventful strange and wordy it feels unrelated sequences tied like that nasty opening involving a little girl dead cat and fire in to a sparse story involving photographer mario played by a chest puffing john caffari who s mustache is a dead ringer for nintendo s iconic mario what s the odds that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady a gorgeously fixating patty shepard who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease raul artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages but for most part seems sporadically non existent and unfocused just like his writing ramon sempere s striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on fernando garcia morcillo s hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created the leads are capable but there s also a sturdy bunch the pick being víctor israel of secondary performances slow with little in the way of interest but this dreamy set up that seems to go on and on manages to keep you watching until its closing 
__label__0 what an awful movie the idea of robots fighting each other is cool but the storyline is ridiculous real human action laughable acting non existent and special effects on which this type of movie must depend are archaic i thought it must have been made around 80 84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990 that s 5 years after aliens ok lots of people said it was good considering the low budget but i just think what s the point it looks totally unbelievable i wouldn t mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other 
__label__0 awful awful awful a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make once again i m amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don t have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good i wonder if she has seen this watch this at your peril the boredom may kill you 
__label__0 even though the plot was very well detailed and the story line was understandable the fact that steven seagals voice was dubbed with some one else s through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else s voice was doing the talking for him i don t know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie i think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered i have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film when one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on dvd this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged i have been a long time follower of steven seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years to date i think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
__label__0 like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies if you asked me to name a good gangster movie i d have dozens to choose from if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you the last time that film is the general unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name this is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it s more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor like goodfellas 1990 and american gangster 2007 two superior mob movies the general is based on real people and true events the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill brendan gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult meanwhile the police led by an inspector named kenny jon voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him perhaps because it s a film in the same category as the marvelous goodfellas 1990 and the first two godfather films i was expecting too much from the general but that may be going too easy on it this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far too stretched running time of screaming bad scenes let s start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented for some reason director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black and white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full fledged color film now i have nothing against b w pictures not even ones made in modern day times schindler s list 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in black and white and it s a masterpiece the general made just five years after schindler s list is not the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video game like quality that i found simply annoying the filmmakers were obviously going for a realist s documentary like style like schindler s list did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classic style motion picture performances in the film range from passable to poor brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting the sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime noir appeal but that also fails because again it s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place but the worst thing that occurs is that there s not one not one character in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for in fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was okay so what moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time consuming here i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did if a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing no remorse no relief no surprise nothing we just say so what and that s all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorly made crime film 
__label__1 otto preminger s noir classic works almost as a flip side of laura while that film was glitzy and features the high fa luting clifton webb this film is a whole lot seamier dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked andrews is quite fine a lot less wooden than he s been in the past and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion piece to preminger s equally lurid whirlpool also starring tierney 
__label__0 john rivers life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car during the days she has been missing he confronts a man that s been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other side through e v p electronic voice phenomenon naturally he doesn t believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e v p soon enough john is hooked onto it but something supernatural doesn t like him interfering with the dead as now other then contacting his wife the white noise is foretelling events before they happen since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn t my copy but then again i don t think the owners were in a hurry to get it back as they haven t question me about it oh well so i decided to give it a play as i was in an undemanding mood after hearing and reading all the bad press on it i wasn t expecting anything remotely good but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes well more so the 60 minutes as the last half an hour was pretty much a blur of confusion the film is nowhere as good as it could have been but the time breezed by quick enough even though it s a rather tepid supernatural thriller i thought it wasn t all a waste the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there s a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film that s when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn t fit in with the context it becomes rather hectic loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera work that gets to close into the action i couldn t understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey it s a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big but hits rock bottom i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera work other then the distinctively stark lighting the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware which makes it come across as very sterile and empty you can easily see that the film s heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story there s just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material after a while it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood curdling stuff from beyond the grave it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while the e v p machine was the star on the show well it did have more impact than the limp performances michael keaton is more than capable actor but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers he really deserves much better though everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable not because of the performances but of the lack of depth in their characters this clunker wasn t bad to begin with but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically i wouldn t care to see it again and i wouldn t recommend to anyone unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror thrillers it s just a damn shame that this over produced flick couldn t put it together successfully as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand i didn t hate it but what a disappointment 
__label__0 this film story is bad enough which can happen in real life i m very can not understand when they show us this bad film i say it was bad because there is some reason 1 if madonna was rich and can do everything she want then why she falling in love with that bad man 2 how can the story script is so weak she was so rich can do everything she want but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible the words i love you it doesn t meant anything in this film 
__label__0 this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didn t touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they re saving those old chestnuts for dooley s next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley s prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs 
__label__0 need i say its a stinker i gave it a rating of 2 only watch it if you suffer from insomnia there s plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroine s well being a few disagreements slight raising of voices that s pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldn t happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing mother daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her it turns out the older woman s daughter cassandra is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why he s still hanging around years after cassandra s death is a good question there s also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everything cooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently locking the door since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is there s nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there is no mounting tension in this film just bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time 
__label__1 this movie is very underrated it s highly imaginative creative and clever it s just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one but the film was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked as the years passed bill ted s bogus journey also bombed at the box office whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late in 1991 bill and ted already seemed so 80s even though the 80s were only a couple years ago back at that time the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap hip hop pearl jam nirvana grunge and the seattle sound bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne van halen and guns n roses music along with their 80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in 91 and i think that s one big reason the film bombed at the box office nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like excellent and bogus in 1991 gremlins 2 which also came out in the early 90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the 80s the transition from the 80s to the 90s was a much faster change then now with the 90s and 00s 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 whereas right now 2002 and last year 2001 still looks looked like 1995 or 1996 if only excellent adventure which was made in 1988 was released that year instead of 1989 and bogus journey was made quickly and released in 1989 then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first 
__label__0 i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it it was one of worst movies i ve ever seen i m a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie i would probably never talk to them again anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry hermit type personality i m gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too just like the self centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie i know everyone has different types of humor some people may not even like mine but that s okay i don t think this covers any range of humor though this movie is as flat and dull as wes anderson s mind go in and get ready to walk out it s best to get your money back too 
__label__0 story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while all the action is in the end but you won t have to laugh because the movie is funny but because the story is pathetic the funniest part is when harvey i m not paranoia keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre oscars for this guy 
__label__0 seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good but the plots just got worse the storyline were either too boring or predictable george isn t always funny he sometimes acts stupid his jokes are overdone his mom is the silliest character of the show how can a mother treat her own son that way okay if it was the daughter in law but this was her own son i give this show a 4 10 just because the first few shows were a little funny the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job don t know how these shows get to play for so long if you re really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch i d suggest you watch this 
__label__1 cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film the best way i ve been able to explain it is that it s quite acidic though it s not totally random the story is about nyatta a young cat boy and his sister nyaako nyaako is very ill and dies however nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it the story is about their quest to bring nyaako fully back to life though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random it is not most of it is symbolism for life death and rebirth you can also see references from other tales such as hansel and gretal this strangely cute short film has an interesting story packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen 
__label__1 ag was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising this show lived up to the gothic moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show this show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows which are so less than satisfying viewing the call for a dvd box set is well based this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing a public that is tiring of over saturation of mind numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling bring on the dvd box set 
__label__1 i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectations until now burning paradise doesn t contain the flat humor most hk movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first one which is one of the coolest i have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes but mind there s also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall yep it s not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film it s ringo lam and i m sure as hell going to check out more from this director ace 
__label__0 eddie murphy for best supporting actor what an insult to alan arkin and djimon hounsou jamie foxx who can act walks through this film like a zombie beyonce that was acting this movie pales in comparison to chicago or just about any other recent musical if it were not for the great singing and performance of jennifer hudson i would have given this a zero and no i never saw the stage play so i am not making the typical broadway vs hollywood rap 
__label__1 interesting characters lots of tension as close to black and white without being black and white i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get away i m a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they ve done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks in this film we never know who s money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot too bad the film could have been great 
__label__1 albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class a western except one the story that really belongs to a class b or c that was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so thrilled to see a western in color but nowadays it just looks very primitive nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns it is entertaining the original color and sound are very well kept on the dvd that recently came out gabby hayes is a good sidekick lon chaney is mean as always and randolph scott a bit more cheerful than usual in a film named albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere 
__label__0 i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke if the ranking had a zero this movie would get it the dinosaurs were awful the storyline was ridiculous the acting really doesn t qualify to be called acting the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was 
__label__1 having first achieved fame with drunken master jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983 s project a a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re established him as a major star by the time police story was released two years later the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its zenith and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy it broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50 rise in police recruits but viewed 20 years on is it any good as an action movie police story unquestionably stands up there are several terrific fight scenes some stuntwork that recalls the very best of chan s hero buster keaton and a compelling if over violent climactic tussle jackie s performance is also very strong and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film s impact just a little his charisma carries it through furthermore in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger jackie took a momentous gamble though in the event nobody seems to have noticed by praising police story as a simple good vs evil battle critics belittled the film s ambiguity of tone and whilst it s hardly the brothers karamazov in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas in short this remains a quality popcorn movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film s final scene a potent boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period 
__label__0 i haven t seen this don t plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay unless until poor little rich girl straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007 in fact i don t know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsay s recent movies i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she cleans up her act all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies up to this time movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production now lindsay will probably have to go to auditions actually compete for any role her reputation is currently poison quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in sooooo now lindsay is going to have to deal with not being wanted is she going to be able to handle this i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv show all of the foregoing is merely my opinion i have no inside information 
__label__1  sasquatch hunters actually wasn t as bad as i thought spoilers traveling into the woods park rangers charles landon kevin o connor roger gordon matt latimore brian stratton david zelina spencer combs rick holland and his sister janet stacey branscombe escort dr helen gilbert amy shelton white her boss dr ethan edwards gary sturm and assistant louise keaton juliana dever to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area when they make camp the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area when members of the group start to disappear they start to wander through the woods to safety it s discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survive the good news this wasn t as bad as i thought it would be the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half way point when the creature attacks that is a masterful series of scenes as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature and the suspense throughout the entire play out is extremely high the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly they really do add much to make this part so creepy as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard it s quite effective and works well it s quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing as a man is running through the forest from the creature he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it raising his hands to holler to them for help the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing the bad news there was only a couple things to complain about here and one is a usual complaint the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might ve had the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen it s so distracting that it s a shame a little more work wasn t put into it i ve complained about this one a lot and is something that really should be done away with as it doesn t look that realistic and is quite fake another big one is the off screen kills in here very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away and then finding the bloody body afterward it s quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward otherwise i don t really have much of a problem with this one as everything else that s usually critiqued about this one didn t really bother me but it is called on for others beyond this stuff the final verdict i kinda liked this one but it s still not the best sasquatch movie ever it s not supposed to be taken seriously and if viewed that way it s actually quoit enjoyable fans of these films should give this one a look and those that like the sci fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well rated r graphic language violence and some graphic carcasses
__label__0 okay if you ve seen the ring you ve basically seen the grudge it s trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that yoko didn t show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and it s not really clear what bill pullman s character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didn t make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more 
__label__1 it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this it s truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films i ve ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slow burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that s ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if you re looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isn t it you have to commit yourself to this film you can t have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and you ll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever 
__label__0 i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old i was a huge comic book reader at the time and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily the end result however was underwhelming i was aware of the emma peel diana prince stories as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form however there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie the final costume was an interesting idea but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero i saw the movie again in my late teen years it hadn t improved much cathy lee crosby was more familiar thanks to that s incredible but her acting was no better the script had a few good ideas like the rogue amazon and a decent villain in ricardo montalban but it just didn t come together and was still boring i think they should have built the back story better and built the show into a more epic climax it was too much like a bland spy film crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book the amazon elements were intriguing but needed to be expanded the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if a bit too camp and low budget the budget was also pretty low here and superheroes don t come cheap it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd if only as a comparison and historical document even superman 4 is available and it has nothing over this film except chris reeve and gene hackman it s worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions 
__label__1 i would strongly recommend this film for any musical fan whose been dying to see a musical make a faithful transition from stage to screen sure it s long but it s length is a testimony to how true to the original musical script the film is being the sets and cast really make sweet apple ohio the place to be fosse protege anne reinking also does a splendid job with choreography giving the dances a nice small town period feel the casting at a glance may look strange to some but they really are qute marvelous reading annonymous s comments on jason alexander s performance made me sick in fact his perforamnce literally steals the show as albert he mixes his own unique blend of manic nervousness with dick van dyke esque charm to create a new and improved albert the fact that he can dance and sing like nobody s business doeesn t hurt either george wendt is another stand out who improves upon paul lynde s take on harry mcaffe by making him less manic and more down to earth and strict his whole character and body language scream over my dead body marc kudisch takes the elvis aspect of conrad birdie to new heights with his subtle insertion of a thank you very much in honestly sincere his physicality though harkens back more to young elvis then the bloated stubly conrad of the original film the fact is that this movie differs so greatly from the original film which added drawn in happpy faces turtles on speed and the russian ballet what did any of taht have to do with bye bye birdie i wonder the only possible advantage the original version has over this one is ann margret otherwise the update is better in every possible way where the old version cut many songs and increased dance breaks nwhere there was no need for them and for all intents and purposes ended the movie in the middle of the play the new version has restored the original music score and has added some great new stuff as well a giant step being the standout in that category we know live in trying times but if you want to get your mind off your troubles and put on a happy face then this is one worth checking out 
__label__1 i think this movie is well done and realistic i you are used to watching hollywood action movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie you are bound to be disappointed this movie is much closer to real life than 95 of what hollywood can produce and that is what lifts it above the average action movie i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act but as i have seen the making of extra i m convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch high quality realistic story and movie 
__label__1 in the barbarian and the geisha john wayne plays townsend harris a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s before him commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853 harris who arrived just a bit later worked through the details and helped ensure compliance as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty all this is true and shown in the film according to some other sources i found the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film hence the title my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise john wayne as a diplomat when he s being diplomatic in most films he says please and thank you as he pummels people so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed in fact i can t think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role by the way i ve seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all however despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting the film is still very watchable the color cinematography is nice the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn t bad all in all a likable and watchable film despite it s odd casting ps read through the trivia for this film you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director john huston where wayne apparently knocked him out based on what i ve read about huston and the way he got along with actors this is an incident i tend to believe and it s also a nice example of john wayne diplomacy 
__label__0 writer director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film unfortunately sibrel s research is so slipshod that he doesn t realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the 30 minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footage finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel s hacked up version of it he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk s assassination than of his smoking gun sibrel thinks he s the only one who s seen it what s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth as with most films of this type sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence 
__label__1 when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it revolved around sarah like the character sees the world revolving around her i got it but wasn t laughing very much onstage and in her show she s racist crude insensitive and hugely self centered i didn t get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie jesus is magic i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me explaining to me just what language she s speaking she s like marilyn manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isn t an assault it s a statement and once you understand that you find you re glad someone s finally giving it to you straight i don t mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy while i like a lot of smart shows i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm i get the impression that it s good but i just don t get it many people will never get the sarah silverman program but i m glad i eventually came around the creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers these people aren t putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together if i was to predict the future of this show i d say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks geeks it will get canceled before it s time and live on in fans hearts and on dvd but take heart ssp creators your audience is out there and we ll be watching for as long as they let you make the show

__label__0 the shirley jackson novel the haunting of hill house is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiece the 1963 chiller the haunting stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent and then jan de bont made this in 1999 the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itself it starts off averagely as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re telling and then the first scare comes a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman s face dr marrow s assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tears from then on the film just spirals downwards the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen wilson s character being particularly irritating so it s such a relief when he s decapitated by the flue the special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i won t bother listing them so all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please don t buy it whatever you do don t waste your money final rating 4 10
__label__0 this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced written and directed vanity project while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me before the burning at the stake sequence this is the worst piece of sh t i ve ever worked on and i ve worked on a lot of pieces of sh t also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario a religious shrine in chimayó at which point one of the local vato loco low rider onlookers growled show some respect man which apparently caused jim to remember where he was as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories like the night we caught the producer director s 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in like they say ya gotta love the biz 
__label__0 i see quite a few positive reviews on this board trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following i see the usual ranting i guess this movie is just not for the easily offended this movie is not shakespeare etc guess what neither was road trip and i laughed my a off during that movie there s a way to make a crude tasteless comedy and deliver laughs and there s a way to just make it crude and tasteless whipped tries to be swingers without the wit or intelligence it seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14 year old boy for god s sake the characters in this movie are supposed to be white collar upright citizens and they talk like some of the idiots i knew in freshman year of high school the dialogue is laced more like drowned with four letter words you would think that people of their status would have some degree of intelligence and a more extensive vocabulary just watch a whit stillman film and you ll see the difference not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish if you know any successful white collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie please let me know and introduce me to them their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty there is absolutely no insight into relationships sex or anything it s just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely and don t take the word extremely for granted because i mean it with all my heart crude gags these are gags with no substance gags that are meant more for groans than laughs the scene at the end between amanda peet and her girlfriends was totally un called for and totally unconvincing there are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by straight men and play out wonderfully this scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures it involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman s mouth it was one of those noticeably written by a guy scenes i wasn t believing it for a second whipped is purely a sick male fantasy that s as flat as it is annoying i got very few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy and those were probably a result of desperation when you re not laughing for a long period of time you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things so i wouldn t mark that down as a positive 
__label__1 i m not aware of largo winch as a comic book or is it graphic novel i actually don t know but i have to admit hearing about an agent hero movie i did expect quite something different than what i actually got while it was startling to watch this at first it was nice watching this move along you could never really tell where it would go some twists are foreseeable but in general you can never really say were it will end up going a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast make this an enjoyable watch not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that but a really good mixture 
__label__1 my kids recently started watching the reruns of this show both the early episodes on the n and the later ones on abc family and they love it i wasn t aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season i m curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes i ve seen them described as highly publicized and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes personally i don t see a whole lot of difference the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout but they do lose some great people along the way my daughter has put the dvds on her wish list so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this i also wish they d done some self referential humor about the changes like on boy meets world where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so and when a different actor later shows up playing her they ask her where she s been and she says upstairs or when early series token geek minkus shows up for the high school graduation they ask him where he s been and he says over there pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera before saying hey mr turner wait up and running off screen mr turner being another character who left oh well maybe there will be an e true hollywood story on this or something i was just glad to see aunt hilda show up for the finale she was always one of my favorites it s too bad it couldn t have been a more encompassing cast reunion the zelda candle just didn t cut it for me 
__label__0 ok i think the tv show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved so when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie i decided to tag along i wish i d stayed home and watched the tv show instead the fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie the plot is next to non existant the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and worst of all gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever it appears that disney took all of the things that make inspector gadget work on tv and tossed them all to be fair my younger child 8 years old liked the movie but the older one 10 years old came away thinking it silly he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor generally i like disney films but this one misses by a mile it is ok for a very narrow age band say 7 to 9 but a must miss for everybody else 
__label__1 streetfight aka coonskin is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer ralph bakshi it is an oddity of the cinema and is very much worth seeing it is live action mixed with animation seemingly influenced on disney s legendary song of the south almost as if it is a response to that flick philip michael thomas later to become don johnson s sidekick on miami vice and scatman crothers most famous for his role in kubrick s the shining are prison escapees charles gordone and barry white yes that barry white are thomas friends and plan to help him escape prison they are stuck at a police roadblock and crothers tells thomas a story about a black rabbit a bear and a fox who move from the south to harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence the story is animated and provides a lot of wonderous things to see like all of bakshi s films most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation true animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness the movie is very violent very sexual and it is mostly about battles between the races for a long time i thought i was watching something extremely important but after a while especially after i got done watching it it started to seem more like a run of the mill blacksploitation flick along the lines of superfly it s very sloppy and doesn t really say anything besides isn t bakshi white whatever the answer to that coonskin streetfight is still very much worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans 7 10 
__label__0 i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didn t sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute boy s brief short rather than a fleshed out full length film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts the 1st part boxer stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their cat mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lot locker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacks off tony doesn t seem to mind but he doesn t even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the all important transition from i m a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because i d like to spread his ass and do him s m style a very important thing to leave out clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the make up bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent show there wasn t enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously 
__label__1  you ll know what i mean after you ve seen red eye overall red eye was a better than expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over it s a thumper it s hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lot other factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant 8 out of 10 more like a 7 5 but that s pretty good 
__label__1 a young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client when he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked to speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day once there he sees visions of a woman in black is she real or imaginary he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill that spends it first third building up its characters before moving to the creepy country house its poor colour contrast give away its tv roots immediately this really should have been in black white but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments still though after waiting so long to see it i must say i was sadly just a little underwhelmed 
__label__0 the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning but their scare factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multi million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the undisputed low of a channel full of lows i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site i will at least give it a go firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called toothbrush or wallpaper for all it has to do with the plot at least they used toothbrushes at least they had wallpaper there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one i m sure they were making two different films by mistake here a more suitable title would have been horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes yes that fits better the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character abysmal the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off bonus otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one again no word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life 
__label__0 how this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me the script is so banal and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising and the talented ridley scott should be ashamed demi moore however shows none a surprise by participating in this film if one looks at her tracklist all in all a high concept style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of 
__label__0 the banner says it all this is one really bad movie which is sad because i normally like sheffer and i have been impressed with andrea roth in other roles this however is terrible i wont waste any more time its just that bad 
__label__1 i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great rubyin paradise is one of her best it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals they were very good moviesalso but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of ashley s best 
__label__0 goodnight mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is in fact it s just the old odd couple buddy formula aren t any new stories being written as i suggested there s hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london s citizens file politely into air raid shelters even when the local schoolteacher s husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to life i found goodnight mister tom cliched and obvious and john thaw s accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his country bumpkin accent incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one 
__label__1 i have lost count of how many reviews i ve written on slaughter high i ve read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide and even though this was his only film he is what made the movie so great at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide then i found out due to the current webpage at www imdb com he was born in 1957 in dayton ohio simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses he did a good acting job who can disagree i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered and that high schools do not have bath tubs i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent and unfortunately for simon s death he made no future films the reason s for his suicide are a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high he looked like a teenager i give this film two thumbs up the best horror film made probably because of their horrible acting the others didn t make fame in the movie business jacob young

__label__1 you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn t afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleese s quick tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two 
__label__1 during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally unearthed for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has weill gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and weill only underscores its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the modern segment is weakly written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june haver both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii salute to our country s history albeit in a never was framework the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits 
__label__1 everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else any way i haven t seen anything like this before so it was crazy of course that s a good thing it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one like chicken little the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying twas beauty who killed the beast war of the worlds scene and more walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema however some parts don t fit like in the original lion king weren t timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar in this movie they are not they were fighting the hyenas backstage ther s more the reason being why pumbaa isn t so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also it s just timon timon timon anybody realise that only timonn s story was told whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks but apart from that it s great 
__label__1 i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was well that was because it isn t supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job there seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm scary movie well this is aussie and original jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting i hope to see more of them molly ringwald was a good move and kylie was an even better move the impossible princess was queen of the screen i recommend seeing this flick as you ll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago 
__label__0 wow i didn t know that someone would make this movie its awful i have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie number 1 its the biggest rave ever where is the that rave i could only see a few people dancing around 2 when they are on the rave they can only see blood everywhere no people two ruined tents and one stage and what do they do they drink 3 the worst actors i have ever seen the captain and his crew awful 4 when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun he shoots almost 30 times without reloading 5 i didn t knew every person in the world could fight as a pro must be a new thing i wonder what the producer was thinking this is going to be a big hit its gonna be a classic sure u dumb s t anyway don t see this movie its a waist of time my eyes are still bleeding 
__label__1 i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as salacious as it sounds this is a three part documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring slovenian superstar philosopher psychoanalyst slavoj zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality it was directed by sophie fiennes of the multi talented fiennes clan she s sister to actors ralph and joseph i enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours it didn t help that an ill advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although that s really just me saying i d like to see part four and five and six zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he s discussing so for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay from hitchcock s the birds or sitting in the basement of the bates motel from psycho which is not to say that his theories are not provocative even when i found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films which is exactly what he s trying to accomplish 
__label__0 i bought a dvd of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film and enjoys movies about the paranormal the movie was shot entirely on video so it has the look of a pbs special about it the special effects are phoney looking but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat there is a particularly effective scare involving a virgin mary statue however the acting is bad the plot scenes are long and very boring and i will tell you i have no clue what happened at the end if you get the movie rent it if you buy it please make sure you pay less than 5 
__label__1 i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabel s cannon are both amazing 
__label__0 i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i re examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good then a line reading actor spoke oh dear this actor s reading sounded like some pimple faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn t read the jacket english dialog dubbed if they d casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn t going to get killed off but stay as the constant main fixture yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus 1 999 999 stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one 
__label__1 i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 4 5 at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian ming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self explanatory i won t give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95 of the hollywood crap especially children s films out there cheers p s there is a real original king of masks who can could do 12 masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks 
__label__1 while hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after wwii england developed a very prolific film industry in the man in the white suit inventor sidney stratton alec guinness creates a suit that never gets dirty unfortunately this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became obi wan kenobi it s a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world if you re planning to start any kind of business you might want to consider watching this movie 
__label__0 i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film he failed thank god the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won t like her because she s ugly the film is just bad for so many reasons the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit those two scenes made me cringe janeane s character is sickeningly arrogant and guessing from her role as stand up comedienne and arch feminist is in real life too she claims that the film is anti feminist when in fact it s just realistic men more often than not go for looks over personality it s interesting to note her hypocrisy too she d been a feminist and comedienne for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film i mean come on she acted in it for heaven s sake what this film was really was anti men if anything it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman s character noelle there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin s character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure is that the best the script writers could come up with blimey they ve never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made there s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn t ugly but is actually beautiful erm was i watching the same film as they were she s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one although having said that i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well she s lanky and gaunt looking i guarantee three things about this film if you ve never watched it you will know what the ending will be you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and you will be bored after ten minutes watch at your own peril 
__label__0 i can t understand all the hype about this movie ok if you like cheap splatter you will love this movie but if you like good stories and good actors don t watch this personally i really disliked the actors in this movie they seem to be hired straight from the street the dialogs are completely flat and you always know what s coming up next the overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget when we saw this movie me and 3 other people we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this just to get their graduation at a film school with the lowest effort another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam very shaking and the bad sound the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone 
__label__0 this weekend just passed i watched 28 weeks later which was very good after that i watched this film i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch the scenes were unrealistic there was no script and no plot the alien creature was unreal and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film forget about this movie rather go and watch 28 weeks later cheers mesake c 
__label__0 i being of puertorican descent had mixed fillings about this documentary first i was offended that ms perez compared senor campos to che guevarra also just a point of fact mr john leguzaimo is not of puertorican descent his parents came from columbia whomever did research on this was not very accurate i feel that the future of our race rests on education this message should have been resounding throughout this film education is our road to freedom and power i think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus in my opinion this film swayed toward an anti american sentiment 
__label__1 so i don t ruin it for you i ll be very brief there s some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast a young graduate of harvard med school brian white finds out he doesn t know as much as he thinks about people he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend mya left him for a job as a tv producer his senior resident wood harris helped marvelously by his creative collaborator zoe saldana bring him up to speed they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money as seems to be true for many of my pre med friends 
__label__1 the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think it s just a fairy tale and even a weird one chaotic for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent and i do like it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by buddhists i am not a buddhist my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly 
__label__1 now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott s performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot lines recycled erik stifler s sex problem is like jim s it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the punishment of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the mile was just stupid and moronic not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn t want to have sex anyway enough about the naked mile i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised to be honest there is no real plot but it s filled with hot girls ashley is incredible and sex jokes aplenty yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler steve talley raises the bar with an exuberant performance the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald s cameo is hilarious there are weak points though coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first i m still baffled to as how he ever got a part while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low first and foremost he lacks charisma a stifler prerequisite you really can t care less about him the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen she shines above him as does the rest of the cast seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish saying that the film does entertain and coozeman s fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny overall this film is worth renting get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit fest event and vent your anger at erik loser stifler 
__label__0 as a young black latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately i didn t although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant the story was simply not properly developed the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more honestly i would recommend a film like raising victor over this one any day i just was not too impressed 
__label__1 this film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years it is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary not contrived but very real it is very interesting and unsettling
__label__0 i wouldn t say this totally sucked but if it wasn t for netflix i wouldn t even have this in my house steve martin s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat he s just not funny he s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn t get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs 
__label__0 how viewers react to this new adaption of shirley jackson s book which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie true enough will be based i suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one and those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of hollywood s current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is are going to love it things i did not like about this adaption 1 it was not a true adaption of the book from the articles i had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to and that seemed reasonable no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand and not even then but there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining i didn t like that either what the movie s press release should have said is we got the basic very basic idea from shirley jackson s book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading character s names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first and decided to throw in a bit of them too 2 they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad no instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear like lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment nice guy this doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day 3 in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there and this time around nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of the changeling the only problem was the so called mystery was so incoherently told that i m sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience but then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad to begin with it s first victim died before ever setting eyes on it 4 the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous he was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was a true skeptic of it s history and in this one he was just a winey voiced bumbling nerd who couldn t sleep insomnia remember and was a compulsive liar 5 i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with nel s sister s family and mrs dudley s little opening speech to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting it s like it couldn t make up its mind what it wanted to do 6 i missed nel s narrative through the whole movie the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through nel s eyes and we always were privy to her thoughts that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version they also tried to make nel much more of a heroine the original nel was not a bad person but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister and she liked to moan and she lost her temper this one was almost too good to be true this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer s had obviously been watching ghost one too many times 7 they changed the history of the house and it s occupents too much there was no abigail crain the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no nursery there was also no grace wife of the original doctor and hugh crain s wives died in totally different ways these changes changed the story way too much i don t know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should be sorry if ya get my drift the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with in conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie this movie should be burnt to the ground and the ground sprinkled with salt my favorite movie of all time remains so no competition from this one 
__label__0 this is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie steven seagal has ever made and that says a lot don t get fooled by the rating it s way too good this abomination hadn t even been worthy of a 0 10 rating if such a thing existed absolutely no plot worst action scenes ever and there aren t too many of them either seagal doesn t do anything himself including the fighting talking lots of dubbing and so on as always seagal is fat lazy and couldn t care less about this movie something which is very obvious all the way throughtake all the other garbage dtv movies seagal has made multiply them with each other multiply this with a thousand billions and all the badness you then get won t even describe 1 of this absolute crapfest 
__label__1 a very strange and compelling movie it s about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door to door fundraiser salesman the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i ve seen in a long while hasn t left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it is now iconic to me 
__label__0 if you liked blair with you ll like this one it has the same lousy camera work and soundtrack and it has the same non existent plot and suspenseful moments it also has tom savini so if you like romero s dawn of the dead or tarantino and rodriguez from dusk till dawn you re in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as well no seriously this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i ve seen in a long time and i ve seen quite a few movies bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of time the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp looking plastic teeth no i m just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote form stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover 
__label__0 the director outfitted in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight a meandering pastiche road show manqué that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater i would have left too but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably tepid applause pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film 
__label__1 i knew about but had never seen grey gardens before i saw the broadway musical of the same name friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense it did but it also prompted me to rent the movie at first i thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch but being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age they have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re examine your own dealings with your mother in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it s fascinating to see the mayleses work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had i echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family but beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film 
__label__1 now i really liked this movie it was so funny both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy s like this one in the future john abraham plays his best friend he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor i just love john neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone 
__label__0 surely one of the most ill advised remakes of a classic in film history especially since the promise of its tag line the most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time isn t even properly exploited although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days its notoriety for awfulness not erotic content mind you kept me away from it until now and i only relented because i have recently enjoyed bo derek s previous film 10 1979 and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas period lead actress producer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl ish sexual innocent witness the inept banana scene and as was to be expected she is made to get her clothes off a few times but as welcome as these scenes were she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here richard harris then chews the scenery incessantly as jane s obsessed explorer father but john philip law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in jane herself newcomer miles o keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel which is probably lifted from johnny weissmuller anyway and furthermore is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film s second half for the record he later starred in two ator movies or would be conan imitators for joe d amato and the king arthur era set sword of the valiant 1984 when still an actor director john derek who also serves as his own cinematographer here had worked with some good film makers cecil b de mille william dieterle and robert rossen and a few great ones otto preminger nicholas ray and don siegel but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability appallingly pretentious at times witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions this was derek s seventh film as a director and his second of four with wife bo and eventually he would only get to make two more the film s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the tarzan legend was tackled once more on film in greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes which surprisingly enough i haven t watched myself yet a mere three years later nominated for six razzie awards including john derek richard harris and miles o keeffe and winning one for bo derek herself tarzan the ape man was co written by gary goddard the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a this time animated heroic figure master of the universe 1987 which i will be revisiting presently as well yay despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an orang utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and fatally john derek s clear disinterest in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self titled movie 
__label__1 what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2 5 hrs to kill watch it you won t regret it it s too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn t anything more other than him i still liked it the music by a r rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it 
__label__0 spoilers if such a thing is possible as a rabid robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind numbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit i m all for bawdy humor but this humor wasn t pleasantly vulgar or ribald it was just mind numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film 
__label__0 title robot jox 1990 director stuart gordon cast gary graham anne marie johnson paul koslo review stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re animator from beyond dagon and castle freak took a small detour here and did a little sci fi flick i stress the word little since this is a very low budget flick and there in lies its main weakness the story takes place in the future a world in which the great superpowers that according to this movie are the united states and russia duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues well the idea is awesome i guess the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director i as a kid loved this movie and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie you ll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like what the hell is this piece of crap franco and i m like well this movie is a sci fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture i could go through it cause i loved this film as a kid and there s still a little nostalgia attached to watching it but everyone else was just not going to get it and i myself realized that the movie isn t really that good first off the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you d have to use some damn good special effects to make it work expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief but unfortunately this being a small scale movie from a small scale company empire pictures which went bankrupt after making this film the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed ok granted once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool and made me go thats why i liked thid movie but every know and them some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in and boom your right back into realizing this film just doesn t live up to its premise and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie this movie is basically a movie for kids you know giant robots duking it out stop motion animation hello but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities which really isn t a good mix so for those of you who don t feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don t have a nostalgic connection to this movie like i do well id suggest you steer clear away from this one gordons a great director but this movie he made just didn t do it for me well at least not now that i m a full grown adult rating 2 out of 5
__label__1 with a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief the plot is well written and the cast was knockout every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining being a huge john candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment 
__label__0 writer director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man recently widowed learning in the last three weeks he is hiv positive he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had brings him to an apartment and ties him up forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out james marsden s captive is realistically cynical and snotty but the actor s own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting it s like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role but his personality turn from shy guy to kidnapper on the edge isn t convincing and neither are the conversations the two men have marsden s gay party boy isn t apathetic of course he s momentarily sympathetic to speedman s plight but he doesn t react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance the movie isn t a cop out exactly but it is a fraud handicapped further by the bad editing the poorly conceived flashbacks the low budget production and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama 1 2 from 
__label__1 jiøí trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia the elements are few the symbolisms simple and his trademark ornaments almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself the man refuses and he s persecuted by the ominous gloved hand in these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment 
__label__0 this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen the acting was terrible horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time first as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie the prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife its absolutely ridiculous i was not scared at all during the movie which i thought horror movies were supposed to do as for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of scary movie for example at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie 
__label__0 who in the world told harrison ford that this was a good role for him and josh hartnett how does a 19 year old who can t fire a gun become a cop over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry cameos equal a surprisingly bad film 
__label__1 honestly i find this film almost too depressing for my own good it is very depressing until pretty much the very end there is no way i can justify passing judgement to any character who did things i didn t like well except for the disgusting character played by fredrick forrest but it s still so frustrating to see people behaving this way putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family they believe they ve lost one son but it turns out they ve lost 2 the key is if they just communicate and face their grief together they won t end up losing their second son permanently but they just can t something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased that andy character truly is a snake the only member of the family that isn t threatening arnold in some way is his grandpa wilford brimley grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves he seems to know what the child is thinking about even though arnold isn t saying much these days it is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to no one else seems to grasp the fact that arnold might be in shock in denial or that his way of grieving may not be the same style or at the same speed as they would expect it s so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is made of stone just because they don t grieve in a way we believe they ought the story is very quiet and naturalistic you re not going to get some spoon fed narration or some hollywood feel good resolution i was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy andy s wife for something he should not blame himself for arnold may have accidentally killed his brother but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage which apparently was a lousy one anyway except for the two people in the marriage it s only dumb luck arnold didn t get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer robert duvall and glenn close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow cannot find it in themselves to communicate with their son to find out what arnold is going through jason presson whom i ve not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called explorers and a creepy ghost story called the lady in white did an incredible job as arnold a great performance from a child actor aside from being somewhat slow at times the stone boy is an excellent and very depressing movie 
__label__0 i ve discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and it s women with raccoon masks on zero special effects and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classic however i can t possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is i m embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again 
__label__0 oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kong s love child it totally took away from the believability of the character now i knew there wasn t a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon so from then on the whole movie was shot for me the money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his i am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch hunters must watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie 
__label__0 this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans don t be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t v had been destroyed 
__label__1 neil simon has quite a body of work but it is the odd couple that carried him to fame this film really works jack lemmon walter matthaw have a great chemistry the supporting cast for this film is stellar as well it is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets the script bristles with humor from this situation this had been done in some forms previously this is the one that brings it all together in a very good package simon has done some other decent work but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible it is hard to imagine simon ever topping this 
__label__0 this film is really bad no i mean really really bad tony scott is a terrible director out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time what appalled me the most is richard kelly director of donnie darko did the screenplay to this now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson now i love mickey rourke s new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it don t get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few accidence s in his time and this is one of them i don t know what to say about keira knightly i think she s a little too overrated i just cant feel for her in films all in all this film is bad thats it 1 10 j d seaton
__label__0 we rented the dvd hoping for a good western the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable but the ideas were very bad here are my problems with the film in the first part why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers at least keep us guessing no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee very long delay in much of anything happening absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in laws even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee wouldn t he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail overall very sad acting and no point to movie 
__label__0 what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie unfortunately with disjointed storytelling frustrating plot holes and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever let s start with the good stuff comedy acting and special effects from the get go this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky the opening scene the monster s origin is campy and quick paying homage the the classic environmental disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters the pacing is fast which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action with in the course of 10 minutes you get the why where and how of the beast and are ready for action in this the movie delivers after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his precocious little girl kind grandfather and talented sister aunt and of course the monster the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work the monster it s self looks great alien yet familiar kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you see it s strings even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd slipping on surfaces crushing and eating those in it s path when the monster s path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie s appeal begins to unravel following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity plot lines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random as for the comedy let me say this i m willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation however as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years still here i d like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white guy that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren t spoiler for example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning a new character is introduced a brother and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder this competition is at it s core funny two brothers who dislike each other so much they even compete at a funeral it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy this subtle slap stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl end spoiler then come the plot holes there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end finding out an obstacle isn t an obstacle can be a good thing for a character but you d expect some comment to that nature instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti climax when problems just aren t there anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start so i ask you why even bring it up in the first place this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other of course introducing new and greater problems is a time tested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation not in this movie instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained 20 of the way and in the end the parts never converge to complete the whole again i m willing to accept that a lot of this might be cultural maybe its in korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy maybe it s normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every page but never finishes one maybe it s ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves 
__label__0 i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham bad dialogue worse worst acting lifeless all the way and the cast knew it the two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life sparkle and were captivating 
__label__1 this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen yes i can agree that some parts may seem dated but this does not distract from the film one should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time clearly by the sex in the city standards charlie chaplin was horribly boring however when judged from the prospective of 1925 america he was fantastic likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed race love affair american manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures it is a natural next step to such films as gentleman s agreement its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with innumerable lines that one just doesn t forget however even when taken only as a love story it is terrific although some attack brando s accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization buttons and umeki who both won oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film taka the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film s end is equally good of course it doesn t have the mouth sucking spit swapping and worse that exemplifies love in today s movies but that makes it all the better it portrays true love and passion and not just heat if this movie doesn t touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead 
__label__1 this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm chair and mellow for a couple of hours wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage as always gently row the plot along there are no rapids to cross no dangerous waters just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received 
__label__1 greetings again from the darkness 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer we are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segment the idea is 18 love relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city of course some stand up better than others and some go for comedy while others focus on dramatic emotion some very known directors are involved including the coen brothers wes craven alfonso cuaron alexander payne gus van sant and gurinda chadha many familiar faces make appearances as well steve buscemi barbet schroeder catalina sandino moreno ben gazzara gena rowlands gerard depardieu juliette binoche willem dafoe nick nolte maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins one of the best segments involves a mime and then another mime and the nerdy yet happy young son of the two mimes also playing key roles are a red trench coat cancer divorce sexual fantasy the death of a child and many other topics don t miss alexander payne director of sideways as oscar wilde the diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch but as a film it cannot be termed great still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer 
__label__1  midnight cowboy was rated x with the original release back in 1969 there are some scenes where you can understand that just a little the movie about joe buck jon voight coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler making money by the act of love it does not work out as he planned after a guy named rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends they live in an empty and very filthy apartment then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things the editing in this movie is great we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way dustin hoffman jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines the score is done by john barry and sounds great all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason 
__label__1 this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up but had never seen it until a few years ago it s reputation truly proceeded it i knew of michael myers had seen the mask saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game and never thought much of the halloween franchise boy how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie now by today s standards it isn t as graphic and visceral but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy and the fact that it is set in a quaint mid west town is a testament to his ability the lighting effects are down right horrifying with the shape seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense the performances by all the players are well done with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance ms curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her we want her to survive and get away donald pleasance plays dr loomis like a man on a mission and it works well he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets overall not only is halloween a great horror movie but also a great film it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie and for an even more frightful time try watching it alone with the lights off don t be surprised if you think you see the shape lurking around in the shadows 
__label__0 exceedingly complicated and drab i m a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why still the sand dunes are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery the cricket is good to see very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over 2 hours long thank heavens they shortened it admittedly we don t get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was 10 times better and i don t really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there s that am i nearly there yet how about now
__label__0 i basically found eden s curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch however there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70 s in the choice of settings and clothing the back to the earth philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent as portrayed in many later versions of the 70 s was right on as was the don t ask don t tell pseudo liberalism of the fraternity made up of east coast intellectuals except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia where i imagine the good ole boy mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images i felt it was very unfortunate that gay culture took on certain standard forms in the 80 s out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the scene 
__label__0 this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think that s always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn t like it and i wasn t expecting much whenever i watch a stephen king movie i don t expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen king s novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies i m sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong 
__label__1 this movie is brilliant the comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn t get it the movie is campy yes but it is uplifting and fun this movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to absolutely fabulous it is a must see 
__label__0 i saw this movie today at the haifa film festival in israel after hearing rave reviews but i guess the critics were just sucking up to willem defoe and his wife the director who were present at the festival it is definitely the slowest movie i have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing besides defoe who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie defoe s wife giada included was ridiculously awful how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me this movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall the only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money i appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers time 
__label__0 conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie there are occasional exceptions but this is not one of them disney should have quit while they were ahead this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 dalmatians 
__label__0  hey everybody i ve got an idea we found this egg shaped thingie from outer space so why don t we thaw it out and open it up yes i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race but hey i want to know what s in it and nobody tell nasa they might take it away from us wow this thingie gives off vibes yes really strong ones on contact so don t touch it but it s okay to cut it open hi there handsome check out my nips later that day do not open uh oh we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don t have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here i ve never seen such organic technology yeah lemme take this stick and stab it i m getting out of here i don t care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth nobody s nukkin me look it s the friendly aliens from the abyss they want us to come with them the end
__label__0 to preface this review i must say that i was i suppose a little curious about this movie however i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted in my opinion this movie shows just how depraved man can be in my eyes the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the jerry springer show act as they do which in itself is eminently reproachable but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives yes i suppose that includes me to whatever extent it is true if not glorifying that kind of behavior as some might say at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior but enough soapbox sort of here s the skinny the movie has an r rating and while it may deserve only that i did look away at some scenes so i m not completely sure i feel that an nc 17 tip of the hat to the other reviewer might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen the plot is very bizarre tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows at the end the movie leaves one with some resolvement and springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world evidently as seen through his show i agree with him there it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change having said that let me just tell you the world s pretty bad glance in a newpaper or the news to see that but let s not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that springer seeks to give us 
__label__0 the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if you re looking for well acted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off half cocked as it were when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strong willed woman turns to mush before our eyes conversely her lover who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes a selfless hero during the trial at least his motivation is clearer he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go unpunished we are told that she never sees him again 
__label__0 this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really really sucks i normally sanctify stuff like this early 70 s grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky low budget atmosphere usually rock house of seven corpses appeared to dispose of even more trumps since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans including john carradine john ireland and faith domergue and the filming locations the titular house the graveyard are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror the film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences though sadly enough they re the only ones that qualify as such the credits are a splendid montage complete with freakish color effects and eerie freeze frames illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation the last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments someone falls down the balcony screaming a lady drowns in her bathtub and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker mr price carradine only fortify this reputation in other words the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director eric hartman john ireland to shoot his satanic horror film project the film within film structure is what mainly causes house of seven corpses to be so boring and uneventful a lot of movie material is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or even worse faith domergue and charles macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes the plot finally gets a little interesting only a little mind you when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard the asthmatic judging by the noises he produces zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses after a running time of approximately 60 minutes the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing i m still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die for some reason i honestly regret confirming house of seven corpses is a pretty dreadful movie the locations and scenery are gloomy chilling but not nearly used to full effect and there s a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed numerous low budgeted 70 s gems were stunningly gross so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the film within film murders really don t count even the always reliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and harrison s direction is completely uninspired not recommended unless you think the zero cool four and a half minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy

__label__0 oh what a bad bad very bad movie cowritten by and starring sylvester stallone that should have been enough and featuring too many rock climbing scenes vertigo falling and scene chewing villains and a botched airborne heist there are two plots both lame one involves a traumatic failed rescue and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty and killing various harmless people whenever possible the usually reliable john lithgow perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn t care bostid in a vague approximation of an english accent janine turner who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot stallone is stolid and muscle headed no deathless lines in this one no living lines either

__label__0 amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best selling philosophical novel the celestine prophecy which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru home video quality actors present so called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy handed direction of armand mastroianni even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of abc s lost or dan brown s the da vinci code the filmmakers are hardly up to the task this film reeks of ill conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point 
__label__0 one of the requirements of science fiction at least before it starts to become satire is that it be somewhat plausible i would think that an anti matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended but i ll leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisis it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand they re getting close to earth so much so that it s become unseasonably hot as if the entire earth were death valley the answer is an anti matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing it s not in direct alignment with the earth who to deliver it but captain tim matheson and his crew that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son corin nemec taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston matheson s father and nemec s grandfather there s a villain here too peter boyle who is the ceo of a multi national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world s food supply for the survivors the idea he might not survive doesn t enter into his thinking he s doing his best to sabotage matheson s mission solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman apparently he s the only one in the cast who realizes he s in a turkey and overacts accordingly the rest of the cast are stalwart true blue and dull except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films allen smithee the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving

__label__0 unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original nicholas cage fairly wooden as far as actors go imbues the screen with a range of skill from non plussed to over the top the supporting cast is no better the plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold it turns out it s just a bill of poor goods disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a befit of a doubt be given the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and whomever scouted the location should be commended there was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos literally at the end disappointed wait for the original to come on television pour a whiskey and enjoy 
__label__0 this film proves that the commercial cinema or else the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille s name there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot what else the screen is somewhat dim o neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse rating 1 10 
__label__0  possible spoilers this straight to video mess combines a gun toting heroine grade z effects nazis a mummy and endless lesbian footage and it s still boring the video s 45 minute running time only seems like eternity the only good part is one of the blooper outtakes wherein the bad guys force a 400 pound egyptologist into a chair and one villain s foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf bowling or tennis instead 
__label__0 george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune he interviews her on her yacht they fall for each other in bathing costumes it turns out quite early that she is not an heiress she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance the supporting cast does little to buoy it up davis and brent carry the picture though it s fairly predictable it is also fairly entertaining it s far from her best but especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre it s not one of her worst either 
__label__1 robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it 
__label__0 this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is baffling take audrey landers as val dance 10 looks 3 is val s song val s story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately she s a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who can t dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the boat then there s the choreography i m sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didn t they use his choreography it really can t be improved upon 
__label__1 i just watched antwone fisher on bravo what an awesome movie and incredible young man this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher kleenex alert feel good and tearful the most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away from at 2 months of age and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister i saw this movie on bravo in 2008 and only wish i had known about it years ago definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection 
__label__0 i quote oedpius rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i am in no way an uwe boll hater like most of the humourless people on imdb uwe boll movies like postal and tunnel rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining but honestly this movie was just horrible i hated it so much that i d give it a zero star rating if i could the story is just crap it spends four fifths of the film building the plot and then they have the middle which is just scenes of grizzly horrible tastelessly done murder the finally end it with a villan wins ending which is totally acceptable but surely it could have been more tasteful than this i am not against uwe boll like i said earlier nor am i against violent movies i f king love violent movies i loved the saw movies the hostel movies tokyo gore police the new york ripper the 28 movies dog soldiers my bloody valentine last house on the left watchmen wolf creek every tarantino movie every sam peckinpah even cannibal f king holocaust but this omfg this was just cruel sadistic and perverted and look at the movies i just listed if i liked cannibal holocaust and not this then it must be bad uwe don t go all dark again you re funny when you are light hearted just like ed wood this was just an awful experience i felt horrible all over after seeing this do not watch avoid at all cost 
__label__1 1933 seemed to be a great year for satires duck soup for instance and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge the tone is like a humorous piece from the new yorker appropriate since the film begins with the goings on about town page of that magazine the only thing odd is the casting made a few years later william powell and myrna loy would have been perfect however after 1934 you wouldn t have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion the young and beautiful loretta young in some shear and slinky outfits or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio even if you know nothing about bridge you may still want to check out a rare example of hollywood satire 
__label__1 a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director s best a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency ben gazzara john ritter and blaine novak persue fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film audrey hepburn colleen camp dorothy stratten and patti hansen much of the script was ad libbed or re written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cab driver patti hansen on the side john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena this film has some great performances by a supurb cast standouts are audrey hepburn she doesn t have a line in the first half of the film ben gazzara has never been better and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat a tat tat delivery highly recommended stars 
__label__1 bob clampett s an itch in time milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise elmer fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching the cartoon switches between the flea s progress inside the dog s fur and the dog s desperate attempts to cope with it in a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can t be scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid it sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only clampett could there are several other elements which make an itch in time pure clampett there s the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog s flesh there s the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat most notably there s the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog s behind which causes the flea to wolf whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor he momentarily breaks off to address the audience hey i better cut this out i may get to like it with a very limited concept clampett manages to make an itch in time a unique minutiae based cartoon like an early episode of seinfeld an itch in time is practically about nothing but very funny with it 
__label__1 a film that is so much a 30 s warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners a studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been torn from the headlines another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that they re not the trophies gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50 s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub plot so the fun can just keep rolling along 
__label__1 this documentary explores a story covered in pilger s latest book freedom next time which was published in 2006 it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia one of the chagos islands in the indian ocean the islanders are technically british citizens as diego garcia is a british colony much like mauritius the nearby island to where the natives were exiled used to be but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland as the island is now a military base for the united states army who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan as usual pilger s coverage is shocking especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders his interviews all round are excellent and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the government s own information to pin him down ranks as one of his best pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives the weaving of this footage with the interviews and the islanders music really heightens the film s impact it is not easy viewing but stealing a nation is john pilger at his best recommended 
__label__1 this show is beautifully done when it first came out i though it nothing more than a light hearted family comedy with quite a few good one liners it seemed to express many families really well too with different concepts of both parent and child however like i said i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening however my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny john ritter accrued the programme stood it s ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of john ritter a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything when the show aired after ritters passing i really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me i thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children particularly that of bridget s character who was worried of the last words she said to him it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad i don t mean them and it s very important that he knows this great show
__label__1 since i am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie this movie is worth a see if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out the effects are really good as well just think land of the lost i originally watched this movie in the early 90 s maybe more like 89 90 on a local channel monster show called morgus presents i didn t scare me but i was 8 and anything b felt more like an a years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and gremlins good b movie fun for all ages 
__label__0 this movie is an utter waste of time the plot is awful the dialogue is awful the acting is ok but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with the photography and some of the special effects are ok too but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch there is no logical progression to the story the story line is utter nonsense it isn t even scary for a movie to be scary there has to be at least a small element of believability this movie has no believability at all there are only three characters in the movie each character is shallow and has no personality most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done or at most mediocre i hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie 
__label__0 van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film as indeed must every single individual involved to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish production values are somewhere between the original series of crossroads and prisoner cell block h most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot as for the acting performances if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable story to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches you will have some idea of the standard of acting in maiden voyage worse still you can t even fast forward to the sex scenes because there aren t any an appallingly dreadful film 
__label__0 jesus christ i can t believe i ve wasted my time watching this movie i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd but watching this film almost put me off her this is absolutely awful i could have been watching survivor series 93 over this the lead guy in this was so bland and generic i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove 91 d his ass through a glass window i was enraging every time he was saying lake and cabin i d kick his ass jordan ladd on the other hand was absolutely wonderful a true angel but she couldn t even save this utter joke of a film sadly she couldn t even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug it looked hilarious i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her it reminded me of a time where nevermind anayways do watch this film because of it s awfulness 
__label__0 any person with fairly good knowledge of german cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past if such a film is shown to people again it would surely click provided if it has something new fresh and captivating for today s challenging audiences this is also true for german film maker sylke enders as her film s principal protagonist kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend she is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting kroko was originally shot on dv to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser if someone were to state a positive aspect of sylke enders film it may well be kroko s involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment it is with kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows 
__label__0 i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically unwatchable supposedly the performances on the shield are great in reality the show is so badly put together that you can t even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they ve had their full impact i don t know what intellectual rationale there is for that but it robs the show of all emotional impact i ll give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but that s pretty much all i can give it it s a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed 
__label__1 i loved this movie i m a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico it s a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washington s character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one s creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you can t miss it might be hard on some of you if you aren t used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzy kind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear you ll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but i m sure you ll like it anyway man on fire is one of the year s best movies a must own for a dvd collection 9 out of 10
__label__0 claire denis s movies seem to fall into one of two categories the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate l intrus definitely falls into the first category but it s not so awful as trouble every day or j ai pas sommeil now ever since i saw chocolat i ve made it a point to see every new movie denis makes and i have always been disappointed l intrus was no exception she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one you get a lot of the denis regulars an older but still magnificent béatrice dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample cleavage and a couple of nice coats the black guy from trouble every day and j ai pas sommeil grégoire colin and that lithuanian or russian girl michel subor s character was interesting enough but the camera lingered on him at such length that i got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when somewhere in korea i think he finally got it cut there was certainly some action gruesome murders a man s search for a son and there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasn t enough to figure it out and two viewings are i fear out of the question for one thing the score was jarring and obtrusive as in beau travail for another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked friday evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets you might appreciate the aesthetics of l intrus otherwise steer clear i saw this movie in french and it s possible i missed something crucial but the dialogue in a denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double spaced and with ample margins in chocolat the silence is sublime in l intrus it s just dull 
__label__0 quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern it s not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it s genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and film making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers for once the near eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink and you ll miss it theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking 
__label__1 this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so funny and i loved it really really cute and funny not realistic but not suppose to be the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much it represents the time period way of thinking though i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players it is sadly an over looked classic film believe it or not but this film could easily become a cult favorite for all ages too bad we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own lindy is unsinkable a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons she is funny and charming she stole the show 
__label__1 i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 moving picture festival in birmingham alabama i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an encore screening when i think of the films that are shown at festivals i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat often with the feel of an elaborate student project there s nothing wrong with these types of projects of course and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film making by mainstream i mean more like a film produced for national release in other words a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater the writing directing cinematography casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro there is nothing typically independent about this film as an aspiring director i am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going this is one of those films as i watched the big bad swim my motivation level was incredible i felt like my adrenaline had kicked in the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put off project when a movie makes me feel like that i know it s really good this is the first feature length project from ishai setton and i found myself wishing that it had been my project for me that s really rare see this film it s beautifully shot and directed and the casting is excellent paget brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance she has a quality about her a charisma that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend that s a gift i think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often jeff branson and jess weixler also did top notch jobs i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production

__label__1 this was a really cool movie it just goes to prove that you don t need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie it traverses continents in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire samuari fight on sinking galleons david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude i enjoyed this movie but i like s t movies this is the perfect example of a very s t movie that just kicks ass if you like battlefield earth you ll love this film its swashbuckling its fast its silly its samuaraitastic it also looks as if it was made in 1972
__label__0 many things become clear when watching this film 1 the acting is terrible tom hanks and wendy crewson are so so but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish the other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i m a babe but i m really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat 2 the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing 3 robbie s dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by tom hanks 4 the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice we are all special friends 5 the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and 5 this is a really bad movie expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed 
__label__1 so often a band will get together for a re union concert only to find that they just can t get it together not so here this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone s ego this is obvious from the start before they even step on stage many faces in the crowd weren t even born when these guys first performed from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream 3 men 3 instruments no fuss clapton by his own admission said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some sort of drumming guru jack bruce just great they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come this one s a 10 for me 
__label__1  one round jack sander is called that because he s a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience if they can last one round they win a prize a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago jack is in love with the ticket girl mabel though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ so he s able to beat jack though it takes him some work as a result bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit later jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer slowly he works his way up the rankings until he s nearly ready to take on the champ in the meantime the champ and mabel start running around behind jack s back even though by now mabel has married jack so when the final fight occurs between jack and bob it s very personal and jack is ready to kill him is he good enough will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance tune in and see this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery suspense films back in the 1920s hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote he did both for this film in fact in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock s silent style as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents the manxman also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband so while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day it was not a radical departure for this great director even with its rather formulaic ending overall while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly the film works well while far from a perfect silent it s well worth seeing and packs a nice punch 
__label__1 having developed a critical eye for film and a love for good cinema i went to see antwone fisher with my breath symbolically held while i am an unabashed fan of denzel washington both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona i am an honest enough fan to admit the very few times when he hasn t quite hit the mark in a film or two and i could be wrong about those after all i am not an actor but this was different denzel would pour his career s experience into and guide a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man the abuse of a child as his directorial debut no less and develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man i didn t want to be disappointed and i wasn t what i did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell but who triumphed despite it all this film did it and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it it takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented it takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven t experienced it and if he can further draw an audience in and cause an audience to emotionally respond without pity the filmmaker has done his job in any film black white purple or polka dotted that is what makes good cinema bravo denzel washington derek luke joy bryant and most of all antwone fisher you have indeed won 
__label__1 although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time this film is an exception i didn t actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison the story and the way it is written is no question it is capote there is no need for more words the play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother this time this certainty is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr edwards is clearly the top of all their profession i recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves 
__label__1 while a pleasant enough musical what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone as the has been composer and oscar levant as his assistant playing a high strung distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical sherlock holmes rathbone s character looks like he couldn t find his way out of bed without help and that help is starbuck played with his usual droll humor by oscar levant upon hiring crosby s character as his ghost song writer rathbone introduces him to starbuck by saying he does all my thinking for me to which levant responds ah it s only a part time job of course this goes right past or over rathbone who s too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from as another reviewer said who knew rathbone could be so funny too bad he didn t have more opportunities to display his comedic talent 
__label__1 i love this show mr blick gordon and waffle are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves collectively as brothers i often find myself trying to imitate the tired sighing accent of their butler hovis or even the scottish borough of gordon there should be more episodes made about human kimberly the episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre teen girls to gain admittance to human kimberly s slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink rootbeer is a hilarious classic we can t drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie slap shot future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd 
__label__0 this film was a disaster from start to finish interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st leonard or as some old testament prophet many of the performances are forgettable over interpretations especially rufus martha wainright s or bland under achievements only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonard s own versions by using a little restraint annoying little pseudo avant garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of leonard cohen s comments making it harder to hear what s being said and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments an attempt at added gravitas for the real thing see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988 
__label__0 i managed to sneak away one night and go to the movie theater to see this one thinking i was in for a treat boy was i wrong considering the talent involved this has to be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen everyone in it was miscast and i find it incredible to read on this site that there are people out there who actually liked it 
__label__0 i ve seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before probably because of it s poor message first of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the cgi i m not a fan of cgi is magnificent but that alone doesn t make a movie no story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talents or do i have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story and this is what s missing the whole 7 minutes there for a simple 4 rating 
__label__0 johnathan frakes is a good actor and when he s not directing a family film a fine director but he really shouldn t have directed this movie and the screenplay should ve been rejected the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about as well as who the characters were and how they worked the original series had many episodes with razor sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children s programming much less a movie which made the original series so well received by adults i mean the tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco and there were characters who did get killed although most were bad guys if they had written it the way that it was originally done which isn t dumbing things down with poor dialogue kindergarten humor and a weak plot this universal studio canal joint venture wouldn t have such bad reviews this motion picture is almost pure blasphemy if you ve seen the original supermarionation series then you ll know what i m talking about the first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to ford motor company even going so far that lady penelope was riding around in a disfigured ford thunderbird made up to look like fab 1 instead of using what would ve been more appropriate considering ms penelope s station not to mention being more faithful to the original a rolls royce fab 1 she s supposed to be a distinguished member of british society hence the preference for england s finest make of motorcars in the original series one other reviewer here indicated that penelope wouldn t be caught dead in a ford he s pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a ford doesn t work at least they could have had penelope ride in a jaguar made up like fab 1 since jaguar is a british car make that is owned by ford but no they had to use a straight ford but the ford product placement doesn t end there every single car you may see is a ford even the news flash that is shown on the tv sets in the movie were sponsored by ford ford ford ford the predominance of ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for ford the original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today but the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional this kind of treatment didn t exist in the movie where everything is stylized to excess defeating the sense of functionality and practicality a lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason the original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets bringing them to life in the episodes the brilliant and lively music score by barry gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story the characters and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective a little bit of stanislavski talk the movie on the other hand had some overly grating performances anthony edwards overplayed brains to a fault bill paxton as jeff tracy just didn t work despite decent acting one of few there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley and many others that i don t care to mention it would take too long quite simply the puppets were more believable second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by hans zimmer sounding more like a mix between days of thunder and apollo 13 and of course the hood the hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with kyrano through a statue of kyrano as an outlet for esp contact but that was where his extraordinary capability ended he s a master of disguise and deception which allows him to sneak around undetected for the most part anyways to gather information of the thunderbirds vehicles for his own means he also uses weapons for his own defense including pistols and generally collects information using a film camera although he tried to steal thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s united artists release of thunderbird 6 which was the last thunderbirds show filmed in supermarionation and was the second thunderbirds theatrical release but while he is a nemesis of international rescue the hood isn t the villain in every thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue in the movie he s obviously the main villain but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons along with the hood having extended mind control ability including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time this totally deviates from the hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust there are more criticisms but the 1000 word limit for imdb reviews will not allow me to list all of them so i will close with the point being made that i didn t enjoy this movie as a matter of fact i think it sucks having seen the original series and supermarionation movies thunderbirds are go thunderbird 6 i was hoping for something a lot better than this the original supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce and that s saying it nicely kip

__label__1 that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn t seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and i m now in my 4th year of college although the film has many flaws it is just so touching that you can t help but sit down watch it and enjoy yourself it is also hilarious danny glover s ranting is just so over the top that you can t help but laugh out loud at him at most time it adds to the film and i m sure it s exactly what the director wanted you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn t the best a must see i highly recommend 8 10

__label__0 i can not believe such slanted jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting a love divided shows it s true face the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it s obvious intent so far from attempting art this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library 
__label__1 hrm i think that line was from the old movie posters this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator here s a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future is going to be fun this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you in this case in the future means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well that s never terribly clear but it s probably something really important there are good guys obviously capitalists i e us and bad guys commies and there are big stop motion robots sadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we don t get to see a lot of the big robots there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end the space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget with said money now spent the climactic fight degenerates into and i m not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks i can always get a laugh in a bar by re enacting the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads like i said it s dumb that s why i bought the tape 
__label__0 is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you ll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didn t have much of a budget compared to spielberg s herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an insurmountable handicap i ve seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielberg s budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he s foisted on us primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show he s returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour that s all that happens ok i ll grant that one extended excursion from the main character s house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it s a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a first year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkity yak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessert thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g wells text else we d have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone can t convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks he s a filmmaker so he s content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesn t need dazzling technical effects some really potent sci fi s have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects don t need to be complex they can even be crude e g fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal byron haskins 1953 version but they must be handled well unfortunately hines effects are both crude and incompetent tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect that s less than convincing fine we can work around that just don t use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away it s not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please don t show it twice but no hines won t listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those 180 minutes somehow boy next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks he s getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree let s have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they aren t even good amateurs but this needn t prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting that s what directors are for and editors which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if america s butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a herky jerky effect that s nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890 s if he was i can say he doesn t know how to do it 
__label__0 i ll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms filmmaker film or movie in connection with this but criminal and crime against humanity seem a bit harsh the writing pathetic the directing pathetic the acting pathetic the cinematography too inept for words the technical skills used to assemble this atrocity none whatsoever this lump of waste could hardly be called cinema the majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than revenge quest no this is just a 10 car pile up caught on video we ll skip the plot in this review because there are far too many holes to be covered at once let s just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie to call the acting one dimensional would be giving them credit what little there is is atrocious to begin with and made much worse by the terrible video and editing the worst part of this atrocity though apart from the plot would have to be the effects or rather the disturbing lack thereof there are no blanks in the guns no flashpots and what few sound effects existed were either stock gun sounds or they were generated by mouth yeah you read that right the filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a shh sound for the elevator doors i guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic this is supposed to be set in the year 2031 after all that doesn t explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist fight scenes however if it wasn t bad enough that the sound quality is terrible he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera and it shows the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all the sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep and they re just as clumsy picture this the bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey a lady starts to run in fear he raises his gun an uzi and shakes it we hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi the woman runs away from camera and suddenly a single blood pack only 1 explodes on her back looked like she was hit by a paintball and she falls flat on her face bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence in another sequence one which almost but not quite makes the movie funny enough to watch takes place in a stairwell the bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he s protecting down the stairs shaking his plastic uzi all the way you may wish to duck there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place i supposed alan deherrera can t be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it if there s any justice there s bound to be some karma out there with his name on it should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste and i would strongly advise against it be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from bladerunner and the am radio that doubles as a walkie talkie try not to focus too hard on the plot it will only hurt you more if you do 0 stars of 10 and that s being generous 
__label__0 don t get me wrong dan jansen was a great speed skater if there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the olympics it was dan but how can it be possible that bill corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan jansen story because the real dan jansen story is truly incredible especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong the way matt keeslar and the other actors skate their technique the dimensions of the speedskating oval it is all wrong shame on you bill corcoran dan jansen deserves better a lot better 1 out of 10
__label__0 i have yet to read shirley jackson s novel something of which i ve been meaning to do for quite sometime i am sure it has got to be scarier than this film i remember jumping once when i watched it the other day although i cannot recall the scene the special effects are great and i watched this on dvd but i am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight after the first few special effects are done with i was waiting for a story to develop i figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel so a good story should be there but it wasn t i was relegated to staring at the gorgeous catherine zeta jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch lili talor was such a suck character i did not like her one bit something about whiny people also the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish dudley doright with his voice and face i could not relate to the characters at all quigon ahem liam neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting half to three quarters of the way i was just dying to go see a campy friday the 13th or a scream queenish film at least there is some type of entertainment value if there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females this had nothing

__label__1 this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films basic instinct robocop and total recall among others he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve an annoying self centered writer with a morbid imagination gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea side town an hour or so from amsterdam verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard s imagination twists reality asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper and it says boom i read doom when it says flood i read blood when it says red i see dead when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it i lie the truth he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer a beautiful wealthy salon owner as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died he begins to imagine she is a black widow is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory i figured out is my favorite gender looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven s too and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality it s a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that stuck

__label__1 i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpent s kiss reigne margot redford s cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford s directorial hands given the material redford s ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again 
__label__1 this is an excellent modern day film noir excellent in that it s interesting start to finish there are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief but i haven t found anyone who didn t get caught up in this story the movie has the right amount of action suspense plot twists and interesting characters in addition it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar based soundtrack i labeled this crime movie a film noir because it s gritty and the all the characters are no good even the only supposed good guy played by nicholas cage gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should t have he also does something at the end which isn t right but i m not going the spoil it by saying suffice to say however that the rest of the characters are so bad they make cage look good speaking of bad guys does anyone do it better than dennis hopper not many at least in the deranged category he s tough to beat lara flynn boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons j t walsh gives another great supporting performance too this is one of those films that never got much publicity but it should have you ll have fun watching this by the way try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up 
__label__0 this was a rip off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half hour before this dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america s funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three tawny kitaen must ve really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie coulier must ve needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating 
__label__1 alain delon visits swift sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit man in the duccio tessari thriller big guns after they accidentally murder his wife and child tessari and scenarists roberto gandus ugo liberatore of a minute to pray a second to die and franco verucci of ring of death take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire indeed big guns is rather predictable but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings alain delon of the godson is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter richard conte of the godfather plays a sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the delon character but the rest of his hard nosed associates want the hit man dead like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s big guns subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay interestingly the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice tessari does not waste a second in this 90 minute shoot em up apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car ostensibly big guns is a rather bloodless outing but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets the photography and the compositions are excellent 
__label__1 after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of pity a film or tv movie was never considered so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell including the onset of hostilities with the klingons 
__label__1 love this film also saw it when it was first shown i8n germany in a small independent cinema in frankfurt it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with moritz boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that in his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie it doesn t exist much copies of that film mortitz boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of therapist for the people who wish to see that movie again you could find it on his homepage which isn t that easy to search for but its possible 
__label__1 despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced presented in digestible as digestible as war can be episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u s the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year 
__label__1 the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team networth vs the supposed professional team magna but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you d be right while the magna team has struggled at times the street team has simply disintegrated week after week first some things to reiterate as far as the apprentice 3 first of it continues the same absurd mentality from trump and the game in this series if your a good project manager but you lose the team will turn on you and you will be fired despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs simply absurd that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually weeds out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best lolanyone this season weve seen a total of cursing backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns the list of victims so far cast tara dowdell audrey evans danny kastner those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by trump the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict anger and suffering it s just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game yes its the game it s the apprentice where manipulation backstabbing and always popular everyone gang up on the project manager mentality rules it has been an entertaining ride though the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses to building of new apartments still though it s still the apprentice though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner 
__label__1 ironically the most talked about american film in the 2008 new york film festival is 98 in spanish the extra long film s controversy began at the cannes festival there were love hate notices and considerable doubts about commercial prospects as consolation the star benicio del toro got the best actor award there i m talking about steven soderbergh s che of course that s the name it s going by in this version shown in new york as at cannes in two 2 hour plus segments without opening title or end credits che is certainly appropriate since ernesto che guevara is in almost every scene del toro is impressive hanging in reliably through thick and thin from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into bolivia it s a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours with an intermission between the two sections there are rewards there s an authentic feel throughout fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish though some of the actors oddly enough in the english segments especially are wooden you get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare che style was like the teaching the recruitment of campesinos the morality the discipline the hardship and the fighting as well as che s gradual morphing from company doctor to full fledged military leader use of a new 9 pound 35 mm quality red digital high performance cine camera that just became available in time for filming enabled dp peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold but at times still sing and are always sharp and smooth the film is in two parts soderbergh is calling them two films and the plan is to release them commercially as such first is the argentine depicting che s leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late 50 s and the second is guerrilla and concerns che s failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution a fruitful mission that led to guevara s capture and execution in 1967 the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and i think shot first producer laura bickford says that part two is more of a thriller while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes yes but both parts have a lot in common too much since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the bolivian revolt was doomed from the start the group of cubans who tried to lead it didn t get a friendly reception from the bolivian campesinos who suspected foreigners and thought of the cuban communists as godless rapists there is a third part a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of che s speech at the united nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time but that is inter cut in the first segment the first part also has fidel and is considerably more upbeat leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of fulgencio batista in cuba during guerilla i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european style miniseries which might begin with a shortened version of walter salles s motorcycle diaries and go on to take us to guevara s fateful meeting with fidel in mexico and enlistment in the 26th of july movement there could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions this is far from a complete picture of the man his childhood interest in chess his lifelong interest in poetry the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on and what about his harsh cruel side really what soderbergh is most interested in isn t che but revolution and guerrilla warfare the lasting impression that the 4 hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich someone mentioned being reminded of terrence malick s the tin red line and yes the meandering episodic battle approach is similar but the thin red line has stronger characters hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides che and it s a really good film this is an impressive but unfinished and ill fated effort this 8 years gestating heavily researched labor of love how many more ocean s must come to pay for it is a vanity project too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries radical editing or major expansion would have made it into something more successful and as it is it s a long slog especially in the second half it s clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down though it s not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one 
__label__0 watching kroko i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life i would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters absolutely no development e g kroko the metaphoric german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot wise chances to do so uninspired actors non evolving plot i guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated pictures were low contrast gray and dark i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu the story had certain potential though it could have made a good short story 
__label__0 inept boring and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student cassie melissa sagemiller is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean casey affleck i can t begin to tell you how bad this is nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value i did not like this cast in this particular film they are all sadly unconvincing then again their roles are no good to promote this as a horror film is a joke where are the scares there s no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but that s about it how on earth did this project get the green light writer director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense worst of all the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless the alleged killer cut that i watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium 1 10
__label__0 i d heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we d both heard that this was a terrifying film really scary how disappointed was i very apart from that one scene we all know which bit nothing happened i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something nearly all the reviews here say what a scary gripping atmospheric movie this is i just didn t see it i m afraid maybe there s a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in britain a big let down after all the hyped reviews :(
__label__1 nina foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail biter she accepts a position as secretary to a london society dowager played imperiously by dame may witty and her creepy son the effete and bothersome george macready before she knows it she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she s never seen before where witty and macready are calling her marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she s macready s mad wife of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she ll manage it my name is julia ross has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe string budget and b movie pedigree there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors in any other gothic thriller the heroine would have swooned screamed and dithered waiting for her hero to come and save her so i can t tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself well done grade b 
__label__0 i saw this movie for 2 reasons i like gerard butler and christopher plummer unfortunately these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of judas iscariot because it does explain his disdain for all things christian but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public me and the 5 other people who saw this film that he still exists i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself

__label__1 im not usually a lover of musicals but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliver this film is so well made the characters are well depicted the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great my favourite being reviewing the situation sung by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagin i wasn t old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs usually it was who will buy my wonderful roses so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film its a timeless musical you definitely couldn t remake it it stands on its own its not accurate to the book and i don t think it would have worked so well if it had been i don t think charles dickens would be disappointed as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london the orphanages the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive and the film portrays this very well also another great reason to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terrier notice his long thin legs this was bred out of the breed many years ago they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him and he is exactly how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian times notice he has scars which is probably makeup on his face bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit a victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit his a beautiful dog any way and notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancy he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he was this is a great musical to watch if you like musicals and if you don t like musicals give it a try any way there s something for everyone in this film

__label__0 this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i d warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies which i do that this is not even amusing the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country some strangers appear and the problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from a to b this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens i am really curious how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end 
__label__0 i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero unfortunately there isn t so i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is the characters look like they were drawn by pre schoolers no wait i ve seen pre schoolers do better i prefer misadventures of flapjack to this terrible excuse for a cartoon i m probably saying what others have said two words rip off remember that episode of dexter s lab when they raced go karts down that volcano yeah mister fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed they even ripped off shadow lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemon he even cashed in on that franchise that one character is a cheap rip off of mandark from dexter s lab mister fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap everyone has their own opinion but those of you who like johnny rip off test your e just lying to yourselves do yourself a favor change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen 
__label__1 i ll be honest with yall i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didn t think i would like it at all but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it i liked the acting was great not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy this was a great show to watch and i ll tell you why it was a great show my father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law order he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters my mother and myself and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadn t passed away 
__label__1 anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film s protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet is jake a mesmerizing anthony demarco simply transferring the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image or could the creature be real writer director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing her choice of using one setting a suburban house adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents however it is the creepy minor characters mrs bender barbara gruen an unhinged babysitter and sam stone ben bode a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind jake s closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell 
__label__1 if any show in the last ten years deserves a 10 it is this rare gem it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun filled with heart and laughs this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference the furniture was ugly the clothes were colorful and the even the drugs were tolerable the hair was feathered the music was accompanied by roller skates and in the words of merle haggard a joint was a bad place to be take a trip back to the greatest time in american history fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other this classic is on television as much as full house don t miss it and always remember to shake your groove thing 
__label__0 a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father ray milland syrupy sugary and most of all sappy story about a battle of the classes when rich kid ryan o neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout catholic father but no one in the film is more annoying than o neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as harvard s champion yuppie followed 8 years later by oliver s story 
__label__0 i ve finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well it surely wasn t worth waiting all this time to see it the incubus is strictly by the number horror film unseen killer monster is raping and murdering women in a small town the film goes like this movie opens with killing then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another killing even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another killing surprising huh blah blah blah etc the film is totally predictable from beginning to end even the stupid big red herring used throughout the movie wouldn t convince a 5 year old and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character so when the shocking surprise ending arrived i wasn t shocked or surprised in fact it was so funny that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie it s so silly anyway the film is so by the number that the rock band sequence is one of the few stand out moments in this dreary flick it s a stand out scene not necessarily because it s good but because it s so funny and pointless the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater s washroom by the incubus the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography which i actually liked but aside from that there s almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus except that it s unintentionally hilarious 
__label__0 my favorite quote from crow was when the car was going off the cliff the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of it this had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier if it weren t for mystery science theater i wouldn t be here today p:P
__label__1 i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it it s beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time it s difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think i m not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now i m able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in post war british films to watch this 
__label__0 bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance visually stunning in some parts but that s about it the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel if you re really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper 
__label__0 what a fantastic premise a movie about the berlin airlift it should have it all tragedy suspense comradeship rivals berliner frauleins and tough us pilots love and tears what we ve got is a film with none of the above heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so but he fails miserably he acts so wooden that at any given moment he should crack he tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy why would bettina zimmermann s character fall in love with him cause they were throwing stones in a lake cause he brings her coal bricks the sfx are very very well done too much though the hundreds or so planes over berlin look like an attack fighter formation squadron rather than an organised airlift as it actually was interestingly enough the white house the kremlin and general lucius d clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set notice the same drapes hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty by the way general lucius d clay comes across as a small time insecure looser general who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift he was very much the opposite so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion no suspense and no historic accuracy sad it started out so promising 
__label__0 i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great or i wouldn t have bothered to see it the other day i like supporting indie cinema especially if they are gay themed but this movie is almost too much to tolerate those that walked out as i considered doing after about three minutes probably didn t mind shelling out 11 00 or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are either that or they didn t pay to get in in the first place logan is bored he s a klutz he s gay i m okay with that the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry re establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene and the second scene etc etc nothing or no one goes anywhere no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting probably most appalling of all is that i didn t feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan that in itself is a major accomplishment he didn t grow he didn t change he didn t learn there is no one to teach him anything he didn t do anything and neither did the movie scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make additionally the title makes no sense at all 1 10 
__label__1 oh come on learn to have a little fun when i was a kid oh this movie was oscar worthy to me i thought it was absolutely hysterical one of the best movies i had seen now it s a little stupid but come on if you enjoyed excellent adventure you should most likely have fun with bogus journey this was the movie before dude where s my car only this one is actually funny like i said it s just a good time it shouldn t be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one you should like bogus journey it s just a funny movie with some memorable characters for your enjoyment only watch it let go and remember that it s a silly comedy that s all 7 10
__label__1 i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie and it contained both a lot of action and humor i found the entertainment value worth watching and would watch it again or a similar show again i m disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher cash stakes since his life would be on the line again anyway i felt that sean played the role very well and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives the soap opera 
__label__0 i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i m usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i m not sure why perhaps it s that i don t want kevin bacon to be evil and there s disappointment in that but i think it s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 perhaps 12 if they are mature 
__label__0 the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one the big problem is implausability i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next but this movie was so predictable and is just not believable i find that the more i watch this kind of movie the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid if they took the time to make it more realistic i might have enjoyed it a little having said that you might be better off staying away from this one 
__label__1 this is where the term classic film comes from this is a wonderful story of a woman s bravery courage and extreme loyalty poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband who through the years learned to appreciate her yeah right a pearl luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role and what a waste of an oscar in the great zigfield it really didn t show what if any talent she had other than her exotic beauty but in good earth she shows that she can really act her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either people say that she didn t show any real emotions in this film like hell her character olan is a shy and timid woman with inner strength she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions example those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot if you people are saying that she doesn t act well in this film you are not looking paul muni shows that he can act as well his character is not a likeable one to me he never sees her for what she is until the very end of the story a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother with her own special beauty the greatest one of all the beauty from within like a pearl if you get a chance to see this film watch it you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created 
__label__1 eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius and this is eddie at his very best his material is extremely witty and hilarious and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage instead of insulting the audience s intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences hitler the moon landing and the british with so many memorable laughs one can t help but repeat some of his lines forever more do you have a flag should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see dress to kill by far the best british standup comedian i ve ever witnessed eddie izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage however his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is dress to kill is a treasure one that luckily has found its way to home video and can and should be enjoyed again and again

__label__1 college girl joanne murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments which includes selling the unneeded furniture this takes place during a break so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly empty premises on campus dorm that dripped blood is a low budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining the acting is pretty bad the plot is predictable but the gore effects are quite good the film was made by ucla film students stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow for next to nothing soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in very similar to the enveloping forests of jeff leiberman s fantastic just before dawn 7 out of 10 it s great to see daphne zuniga of the initiation fame run over few times by a car 
__label__0  spoiler warning absolutely without a doubt one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen totally impossible to take any of this seriously it would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it during the glory days of her program carol burnett and company who often did take offs on films skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine carol played jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from harvey korman played oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked ryan o neal the only thing funnier than this bit is the real film what a death scene at the end jenny really looks like she s dying alright dying for her make up artist to come in and give her a little color and of course we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient s final moments the ending scene with ryan o neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic he had plenty to worry about he never did recover from this 
__label__1 the 1997 low key indie dramedy henry fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to revisit for a sequel a rumpled dissipated drifter thomas jay ryan strolls into town his anarchistic rantings and delusions inspire a nerdy garbage collector james urbaniak to write poems while henry half heartedly tries to boink the guy s sister parker posey as the poet prospers henry declines nothing special about any of the characters or the story a pitch for harold and maude s ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen but parker posey ain t the semi official queen of the indies for nothing so when writer director hal hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast a film was born though we catch up with the same characters many years they re in a completely different sort of dark comedy this one s laced with espionage henry may have been an international spy and possible double or even triple agent for years before meeting the others he s either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries everyone wants his rambling incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies posey s fay is either the wife he left to go on the lam or his widow depending on who s telling the truth fay s efforts to find henry and or the hotly contested journals include a globe trotting gauntlet of multinational hit persons and henchmen at every turn she never knows who to believe or trust nor do we while herding these unlikely characters into jason bourne jack ryan territory hartley s script retains the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance steering clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical menaces his sly lampoon of the paranoia duplicity and musical chairs alliances of today s geopolitics starts to crumble towards the end even so fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of hartley s recycling methods 5 18 07 
__label__0 this could be looked at in many different ways this movie sucks its good or its just plain weird the third one probably explains this movie best it has strange themes and just has a strange plot so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad average or even how good it might be the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad christopher walken is always off the wall he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is comedy wise it is somewhat funny this of course meaning that it does have its moments though very few but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way the directing was average as well barry levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film the writing is the key to a good comedy obviously that means the writing here failed at best it is below average considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible that is never a good thing to say about a movie though if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating he is always quite a character in his movies stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don t go anywhere not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie 
__label__0 nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time it s being brought to you by the never inevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn t click as science fiction it s plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all that s nearly bare to resist give me a f ing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn t set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn t make this one great i d like to point out another film called the assault 1996 by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why top notch 1st person femme fatale action movies don t translate well in america sorry fellas 
__label__1 i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoe foxes was such a huge departure from all of that where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy little darlings anyone jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction this was not disney this was not porky s this was not halloweed this was a dark powerful story of the destruction of young lives sadly it s a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed with a current soundtrack and still be wholly relevant it s not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver 7 out of 10 barky
__label__1 this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark half man type critter on an uncharted island then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation evil laugh but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them lots of bad gci goofy plot elements and babes sweating in tight t shirts follow these monster movies all follow a similar formula but this one spices things up with a bit of humor i guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek not to mention the sexy babes but let s mention those sexy babes several hot babes in tight t shirts sweating profusely one s in her undies at the beginning another at the end thank you thank you makers of bad movies the plot is full of goofy stuff a guy drives up in a jeep slams it right into a tree then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter yeah um well how bout we think about that for a while we ll get back to you the sharkman is hilarious either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance he s evil that s his motivation he makes no apologies overall if you want a stupid fun b movie this one should do the job

__label__0 this film like the first one the man from snowy river has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original unfortunately the bad outweighs the good the good magnificent scenery better than the first film i love those high country shots in australia tom burlinson is still a likable guy as jim craig bruce rowland did a nice job with the music too the bad once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine jessica sigrid thornton who is a world class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her in this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father previously it was kirk douglas now replaced by the always profane brian dennehy speaking of that it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lord s name in vain that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s this film like the first one
__label__1 so mary and rhoda have aged who hasn t i was a teen when mary premiered and a young adult when it left the air yes it was great to see mary and rho together and yes maybe the film didn t sustain the comedy of the original series but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute example the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about old people isn t this typical of the mentality of present day hollywood tv and film bean counters this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best but it s a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s 
__label__0 me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a premiere surprise that is we bought at ticket to the preview to a movie before it opened here in denmark we sat through the 1st hour or so and then we left the point of the movie seemed to be simply to portray the era and club 54 but it did so at the expence of character development of which there was none and plot of which there was little seldom have i been so indifferent to the characters in a movie the music was good though so if you like to hear some good music and get a fix of that 70ies mood i guess it is ok but don t expect to get a plot of believable characters 
__label__1 a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise placed at the beginning of talkies prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full on silent film which is still is at heart and flirting with sound and sound effects the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn t help it at all hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach for example is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance other than that the movie rolls along more or less well with little jumps in continuity here and there something quite common in films from this era and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents in a way this is an experiment of a movie and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for she s a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time the last of the flapper jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now with the onset of female independence women as professionals were being represented in film that brooks s character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does reconcile with him later is also a little ahead of her time however her character s fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn t there that her boyfriend wants her to succeed and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense seen in the man who knew too much and cuts from brooks her image on screen and the murderous boyfriend even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live brooks with the now dead one a chilling effect to a chilling powerful movie 
__label__1 first of all the movie is an ingenious work of art movie the plot was filled with surprises a little kid pretends to be a grown up inherits one million dollars and how he spends it i mean how whacked out is this walt disney really outdid themselves this time the comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected i mean was this movie ok or was this movie ok it also teaches a lot about wise youths and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants but also it sucks how the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free that s like let a killer get bailed free for ten years if i were to do that i d get beaten with a suble jack a huge stick that stings when used to bench your butts really hard that kid is really lucky back to the story the movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it s not perfect the acting was good and bad the kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were excellent the special effects on the other hand was lame plus this movie isn t based on reality i hated and loved it at the same time 
__label__1 the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother s love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman nandini who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar s family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his father s enemies when she wants to leave narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called nandini vs narasimha india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and krishna vamshi s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by ismail darbar it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension the film s biggest strength is the performances karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child after fiza this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india s most underrated actress deepti naval who sensitises her character to perfection sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch shakti it could have been better but it is definitely a must watch 
__label__0 although it really isn t such a terribly movie especially considering it was made directly for tv distribution it ll be very difficult to point out one aspect in bloodsuckers that is actually original or refreshing vampires in space isn t exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting still no one seems to realize it s an incredibly stupid premise that can t possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie bloodsuckers even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare the plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from john carpenter s ghosts of mars and james cameron s aliens as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons like the voorhees and the leatherfaces the good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters captain damian is the unpopular rookie who ll really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous and far more loved captain churchill the other annoying characters include a typical cowboy style and trigger happy macho pilot a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board she s of asian descent like the girl in aliens was latino and the army s most valuable secret weapon a blade girl quintana is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans she can spot enemies when they re still light years away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someone s wet dreams they eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampire meanie michael ironside in yet another downgrading role bloodsuckers is an irredeemably stupid film but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings infantile dialogs and ott make up effects it only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla this film is a non stop series of lame clichés and uncreative ideas but at least it s watchable 
__label__1  the man in the white suit is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick whisky galore sweet smell of success the star of the film is alec guinness whose comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob guiness brings his usual class to the film and makes it much more than a typical comedy in fact the comedy isn t entirely overt by the end of the picture it s nearly become a complete drama it s the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter but a sense of general amusement like the best british comedy of the time the whole idea of the suit isn t very original but the way it is executed is the film is highly original and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh comedy 7 6 out of 10
__label__0 what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time well he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could ve been directed by anybody available out of film school and in fact they probably would ve done a better job they would ve at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes gasp except this time around the apes squirm through groan worthy dialogue nonsensical plotting and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could ve been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered masterpiece next to this tripe as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing luckily for him the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles and alas the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause and the haha we re so clever aren t we way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one sigh instead of seeing this spend the night in and call up some friends and rent ed wood edward scissorhands batman or even to a lesser extent sleepy hollow and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality not shame and ridicule 
__label__0 ok so guy gets bitten by a bat and then turns into a bat well sorta i can only assume this made sense to someone at the time aren t bats supposed to fly use radar and eat bugs instead of attacking humans tho 
__label__0 there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don t get it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross it has every a hem artistic cliché in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie ratcatcher returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers 
__label__1 well maybe not immediately before the rodney king riots but even a few months before was timely enough my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground it just goes to show the state of race relations in america the plot has white mack kevin kline and african american simon danny glover becoming friends after simon saves mack s life in the black ghetto meanwhile movie producer davis steve martin in a serious role thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool until he gets shot there s also some existentialism in the movie mack and his family come to realize that they aren t living as they really want it seems that crash has somewhat renewed people s interest in race relations but this one came out much earlier maybe we ll never be able to have stable race relations in this country but either way grand canyon is a great movie it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor also starring mary mcdonnell mary louise parker and alfre woodard 
__label__1 this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public s misconception of it as a teen flick it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally kellerman the three girls that play jodie s friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing 
__label__0 a family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father s coffee table book come across an ancient decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one eyed man when their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow they re forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior there have been many films in the freak subgenre of horror ranging from tod browning s beloved freaks 1932 to alex winter s hilarious freaked 1993 those are both classics or soon to be with freaked side sho however never will be and if it ever does reach classic status well it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre from the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17 year old daughter that s obviously older than her natural mother this film did not have much going for it the writing was subpar but not completely awful just boring the direction was poor and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable the acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long long time there was far from enough gore violence to make up for the lack of any other quality and when there was a bit of violence it was not well done at all and i can t forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were with all honesty some of the worst i ve ever ever seen in a film overall this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin final verdict 2 5 10 
__label__1  come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted it s a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man s soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things don t go according to what he hoped the relationship would be if you haven t seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading sebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieu s viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together first of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieu s family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedric s attention when mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul the ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearby jeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedric while come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story 
__label__0 while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keith s ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind 
__label__1 scott bartlett s offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante garde cinema there s no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartlett s opening sequence of images flashing colours before a close up human eye recalls dave bowman s journey through the stargate the visuals are richly coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though we re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor there appears to be some confusion about the film s release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film s completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldn t have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought and please don t laugh at this free thinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldn t possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality 
__label__0 rex reed once said of a movie julia and julia to be specific that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly this one appeared to be shot through gauze the story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time also everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters i call this the dead poets society syndrome there was nobody to care about nobody to become interested in dramatically and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances a total disappointment 
__label__0 i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the 10 and bought it now i understand why its so rare this film is so bad so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines are literally the movie s highlight the film is about a psychic pettyjohn cast for one obvious reason her topless scene whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it and gee what do you know surprise a kid in a foam rubber monster costume pops out instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face then escapes to a nearby city but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own but no matter this movie blows all its credibility long before then this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs somebody needs to alert the producers of mystery science theater 3000 if they don t know about it already 2 out 10 really really bad 
__label__0  don t bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just marilyn the story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the vhs box of course there simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why nellie monroe was so messed up this was not a good role for monroe even though i didn t need to see this character to know she could act some like it hot alone was good enough evidence for me but this role just didn t fit her and it s no surprise it wasn t one of her more popular films it s also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark anne bancroft elisha cook jr jeanne cagney donna cocoran and others summary it s not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game 
__label__1 i really enjoyed this thriller i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i ve ever seen the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph 
__label__0 dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands first a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing second the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted as the movie goes on the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect however the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings unfortunately the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong and fast and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for character driven situations and without adding depth to any of them the direction is uninspired the inspiration from j horror movies such as ringu the grudge and one missed call is evident unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j horror j horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning there is no humour or tongue in cheek element in these movies everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you can t help but be convinced and captivated by it the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact very much unlike the jump scares used in hollywood movies the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi the homage to j horror could have been well intended unfortunately the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed scares on the screen the make up effects of the ghosts weren t too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie i couldn t give away the ending even if i wanted to i simply couldn t understand it all i could deduce was that it was something of an anti climax what remains the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom the movie is a chore to sit through thankfully the pain ends after an hour and a half however most would probably switch off long before the end there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie the successful avoidance of scare clichés and the absence of the f word in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find this is what the 2 stars are for those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house the changeling or the j horror sub genre if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra low budget r rated horror movie about ghosts watch death of a ghost hunter it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague 
__label__0  for one of the worst swedish movies ever forgive me for being dull first of all i haven t seen the first one i was bored that s my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one well i hope the first one is better than this it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes for the people that have seen this and think 4 10 is high belive me so do i but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea what s next det sjunde inseglet ii sequels not based on novel or book doesn t turning out great to often and this is a perfect example of one ok i m gonna be honest with you i did laugh a bit it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor but don t buy it rent it just let some other idiot do it or download it 4 10 this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already 
__label__1 i have been an admirer of edward burtynsky s work for years and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work thanks to jennifer baichwal s documentary the severe beauty of the ship breaking yard in bangladesh the stone quarry in vermont the enormous assembly plant in china the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker at times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories the sort of stuff i grew up watching burtynsky s work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia it has not stopped the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap yard somewhere in china the waste had a threatening air about it while the workers were very jovial 
__label__1  cry freedom is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko s death although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko s story be heard around the world much more interesting 
__label__1 in celebration of earth day disney has released the film earth stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves the stars of the show are a herd of elephants a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf the narrative begins at the north pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years we never see the bears catch any seals but the father s desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution the aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots i ever saw it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen one of the disappointments i felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals their incredible speed the idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i think began with or at least it s the first i recall seeing the television show kung fu during the early seventies an interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed there are enough dramatic humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs perhaps because of some selective editing sparing us as it were from the grisly end of a prey predator moment and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on dvd it is a solid film in its own right and you can take your kids three stars 
__label__0 leave it to paul sex on the brain verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story if he d direct a pokemon film i m sure he d turn it into some massive orgy of sorts i don t mind sex or even sleaze check my other reviews on film but frankly it s obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn t see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it it s a shame because it could have been good if the film didn t spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women the game cast of actors does what it can with the one note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them including william devane who is totally wasted here but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls which btw is much more entertaining than this stilted bad film 
__label__1 i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time if you ve never understood the appeal of anime discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otaku town the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scott s blade runner the cell animation while somewhat traditional possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumoto s great talent for character design and visual storytelling this is one of those unique children s films like star wars the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends family entertainment status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms i highly recommend this film 
__label__0  the fox and the child is the new film by french director luc jacquet who brought us the oscar winning documentary march of the penguins it focuses around a young girl wonderfully played by bertille noël bruneau and her blooming friendship with a fox there are some truly mesmerizing moments here badgers mucking about a lynx chasing the fox through a snow littered forest one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times however there s simply not quite enough of them beautifully shot the cinematography is dazzling the bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful it s undeniably a very lush production the english version is narrated by kate winslet but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed the score is also far too fluffy or at least it is for my liking and the screenplay while subtle seemingly jumps from one scenario to another ultimately leaving me almost baffled while there s a nice moral at the heart of the film and the rather quiet performance from noël bruneau is quite lovely the real star is the fox those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous however again there s simply not nearly enough of them to keep up to date with all the latest in film including reviews news discussions and more be sure to visit www mybluray com au
__label__1 what is cry freedom like it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people main character of the story is donald woods kevin kline chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa woods writes several articles where he speaks critically about views of steve biko denzel washington soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa right from the top even from the chief of police when biko dies in police custody woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place so world can find out the truth attenborough managed to make a good movie about people with main message that black and white are the same cause we are all people story leads us to south africa and this movie is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i m disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie this is movie from which we all can learn something although it is a bit long this story couldn t be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko also relationship between woods and biko was shown great just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through but sometimes sacrifices must be made biko s death so the truth could be reveled woods book

__label__1 this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bc this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie 
__label__0 thanks to a dull dimensionless screenplay by neil simon and lackluster direction from robert moore chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty 73 the goodbye girl 77 audrey rose 78 and only when i laugh 81 only this time she doesn t have a child to drag around chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon s the cheap detective 78 and murder by death 76 caan is miscast the characters are mono dimensional the dialog is overly analytical and there s virtually no establishing detail the first half is a less than captivating meet cute coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half the nyc locations as well as joe bologna and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant but at least they provide some welcome distraction and last and least there s an awful song played during the credits 
__label__1 i first read the book when i was a young teenager then saw the film late one night about a year ago i checked it out on imdb and discovered no copies available i then hit the web and found a site that offers war films soooo glad that i did ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why i wanted to see it again in my opinion to really enjoy the film i suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film the book is no longer in print but i did track a copy down via e bay the author alan white was a commando paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book it is written by someone who knows and this fact i believe gives the book and film authenticity i have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film not as good as the book there are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war the film illustrates this exceptionally well i have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch in that order if you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and i only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see one of my all best war films ever 
__label__1 this is one of the funnier films i ve seen it had it s crude moments but they were full of charm it s altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell s nipple i truly was surprisingly this is a good natured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve carell s friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty year old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended 
__label__0 the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message spoiler they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions they blame bears and deer for misbehaving by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger 
__label__0 first of all i ain t american or middle eastern second of all i don t have a religion the closest thing to a religion i have are sports and movies henceforth i believe i would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias most of these short films are an utter disgrace this dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by some barbaric and uncivilized morons instead most of what i saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points examples 1 ken loach s segment sure we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001 two wrongs don t make a right whatever this film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent chilean english accent 2 most disturbing is youssef chahine s segment it is obvious that he has trouble with logic he justified the murders due to america being a democracy and because some americans voted the politicians in power then all americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the middle east helloooo is this guy for real some americans don t even vote some americans don t even know where the middle east is some don t even know what religion is practiced there and majority don t know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes mr chahine the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic the innocent victims in the twin towers came from around the world the murdered firefighters rescuers office workers by standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics and yet we are not allowed to go about our lives because some people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics 3 the israeli segment showed their own bombed victims another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda sometimes it is not about you some people always think about the me me me sometimes it is about other people 4 idrissa ouedraogo s segment is a joke and another political point scorer they obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty blah blah blah this movie denigrates the memory of sept 11th 2001 victims the best thing for it is the trash can 
__label__0 i m basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night 9 27 06 i don t think i ll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor victor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china i ll bet we won t be seeing this one next season 
__label__1 i really loved this film yes i know it was fairly far fetched there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it s traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy he was a little too much don t you think anyway great film great cars and great acting i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night :)
__label__0 i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i m working oh i m sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don t think more than 100 was spent making it total crap who let s this stuff be released 
__label__1  that 70s show is definitely the funniest show currently on tv i started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show i like all the characters but my personal favorites are fez and kelso leo was also an awesome character while he was there i really hope he comes back because he s hilarious it s classic when fez goes you son of a bitch and when kelso yells burn that always makes me laugh they are both great characters and always have something funny to say jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show she started out being really good looking but damn somewhere around season 5 6 she just got really hot i ve seen most of the episodes more than once some like 10 times and there still hilarious this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it the cast is classic almost everyone is funny where with many shows there are only a few funny characters i will be sad to see this show end next year but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever

__label__0 adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty one day he meets gonzalo a poor boy whom mother is prostitute desperate for earning some money gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents this is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some incoherences in the script anyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones 
__label__0 in order to avoid confusion let me clarify a couple of points i am not a red neck i am not even a moderate nor a conservative quite on the contrary i am a radical a libertarian i m not a wasp either i was not even born in the states jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry by and for show offs and i dare say by and for people who have no sense of decency or for that matter respect for other people s life or death especially when the victims are thought to be mostly bloody imperialists killed in yankee soil i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive just plain awful why didn t they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism anybody who is serious about film making and serious about life and death should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non sequiturs with two exceptions the episode of burkina faso almost amusing and the one from india which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack on the basis that afterwards he didn t return home and that he was an american muslim and truth be told when the facts were known he was honored as a hero all other nine episodes essentially and extremely boring and emotionless can be listed in two different categories first i don t care about the thousands of victims americans foreigners children youngsters adults old timers and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion makhmalbaf s iran lelouch s france i m afraid i m going to commit an heresy since it s lelouch s but maybe his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original tanovic s bosnia herzegovina gonzalez inarritu s mexico gitaï s israel penn s usa second the bloody yankees deserve it and can be resumed in frustration and hatred chahine egypt vindicates the suicide bombers loach uk considers the 9 11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the usa to the chilean dictatorship headed by the serial killer augusto pinochet in fact someone should inform mr loach that the victims of pinochet were not related to al qaida and that chile is a south american country which sole existence mr bin laden should have ignored he ought to be informed too that the american government sanctions against the chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie s and imamura japan windingly points out that wwii is related the attack to the wtc imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake it pretends to be obscure it is instead quite ludicrous there s some kind of error shared by many including some americans and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn t commercially screened in the states because of some kind of censorship nothing further from the truth this movie wasn t screened in the states because it is a complete fiasco a fiasco of the wackyest kind even in buenos aires where peronism and other forms of fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants and anti americanism is in vogue the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters and was applauded by a very select public the usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally quaint spectacles like the sight of a mcdonald s fast food restaurant or perchance an elderly jew being burnt to ashes 
__label__1 i really liked this movie i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers but not in this movie it is definitely worth renting 
__label__1 from the view of a nascar maniac like i am the movie is interesting you can see many race cars from 1983 even tough the racing scenes are not that much realistic but i have to admit that i haven t seen any race before 1995 because before that time they didn t show any nascar races in germany from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 80 s burt behind the wheel of a fast car like in his bandit movies if you love nascar and burt reynolds this movie is a must see if you only love one of this 2 things i also recommend to watch it if you like neither nascar nor burt reynolds you still should give it a chance but remember this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award it is the typical humor of the 80 s if you like movies like the cannonball movies and police academy you will also like that one 
__label__1 of all the reviews i ve read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i don t think so though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre s position in an urban area can ask for i m looking for a patron anyone interested 
__label__1 fever pitch is a fun enough movie it has a lot of funny moments including a hilariously disturbing shower scene like most romantic comedies it has a dead zone in the middle where all the heavy she s breaking up with me stuff happens but other than that it continues to be funny until the end even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox it s not overloaded with sports you don t have to be a fan to enjoy this film of course that s easy for me to say i ve been a red sox fan since i was a boy too 7 out of 10 barky
__label__0 it used to be my thinking that movies required plots or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on this movie has showed me that you don t actually have to have anything like that i could sum it up simply as that but imdb wants me to have more lines it was kind of pretty not compelling in the slightest the way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days but there is no passage of time and i m pretty sure it all happens in an hour if you are looking to entertain yourself then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up it would be a far better use of your time time that you will never get back jurassic park 3 was pulled off better than this movie 
__label__0 gee what a crappy movie this was i cannot understand what people find so scary about the grudge the director plays one trick i d have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute to conclude i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the so called predecessor the ring was way scarier and that buying a ticket for the grudge is a waste of money 
__label__0 freddy s dead the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger robert englund leaves a teenager shon greenblatt on the outskirt s of springwood with no memory of himself who he is or why he is there the local police pick him up take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie burroughs lisa zane interviews him she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in springwood where they discover that no children live there therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone it all turns out that it s an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter use her to escape springwood when maggie realises what freddy is up to her some kids decide they have to kill freddy once for all directed by rachel talalay this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five of course as any horror film fan know s if there s still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there s no way in hell freddy s dead the final nightmare was going to be the last one which of course it wasn t the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here freddy s dead the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them the film moves at a reasonable pace it s rarely boring but it s so silly childish feels like some sort of live action cartoon with some awful set piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes craven s suspenseful effective early 80 s original the sequence where stoner spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on it s own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing i ve seen in a while or maybe the early scenes when the john doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the coyote cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard you can t take this seriously i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon yeah that s right a pair of cardboard 3 d glasses the character s are poor the dialogue is poor the plot is confusing it doesn t really stick to the elm street continuity overall the film is a bit of a mess the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour you can certainly laugh at it the film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark scary sinister yet it s so silly simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat there s not much gore in this one there s some cut off fingers some stabbings someone falls on a bed of nails that s about it the body count is extremely low here with only three death s the final twenty or so minutes of freddy s dead the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3 d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i can t comment on how well this does or doesn t work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3 d which take advantage of the process the special effects vary some are quite good actually while other s are terrible freddy s burnt make up this time looks quite poor this apparently had a budget of about 5 000 000 it had an opening weekend box office take of 12 000 000 the film has a few nice visual touches gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold roseanne johnny depp rocker alice cooper freddy s dead the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series apart from some unintentional laugh value there s not much here to recommend or enjoy fans of the series will probably like it defend it but for me this is about as far from wes craven s original classic shocker as it gets followed by new nightmare 1994 which tried to take freddy krueger the series in a new different direction 
__label__1 i thought this film was just about perfect the descriptions summaries you ll read about this movie don t do it justice the plot just does not sound very interesting but it is just rent it and you will not be sorry

__label__0 i ll say one thing for jeanette and nelson even when stranded in a mirthless witless painfully inept musical like this there s still that twinkle in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway non existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievable yes even for a fantasy truth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own real life husband gene raymond in smilin through which nonetheless was a considerably better film sorry i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one hep number with binnie barnes and nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess it s like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting cast summing up painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical can t recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if jeanette s close ups still glow with her gossamer beauty this film is jaw droppingly bad 
__label__0 i have only recently been able to catch up with the films of marilyn miller since they are not shown on tcm in the uk i have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s what was she really like to some stars of this era like jolson some of the magic still shines through but alas not for miller her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes ruby keeler seem like hepburn even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted so we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal she was being paid 500000 for this so i have only two conclusion either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all i think that the truth is nearer the later than the former 
__label__1 this should be required viewing for all young people this is documentary at its best from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity s sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century 
__label__0 studio 666 aka the possessed in the uk is another sub par slasher that has the appearance of a straight to dvd movie whilst many of the straight to dvd movies are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so bad it s good sense studio 666 is a lamentable failure at the time of writing every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review every one of these people have hit the nail on the head the two people at the time of writing who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously obviously they ve seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds if not thousands of times the movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations a depressed singer commits suicide soon after her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up you ll just have to see it for yourself providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part the actress who played dora was an exception to this her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts unfortunately some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie the direction was equally poor the villains did not seem the least bit menacing every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension atmosphere was non existent and the camera work was incredibly basic some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the tv series ghost stories unfortunately for the producers of this movie ghost stories had intelligently written scripts believable performances and made superb use of camera angles maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely they d have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie it s just rock music and not the best examples of this type either don t get me started on that awful song played at the beginning some aspects of the movie particularly dialogue are unintentionally funny unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the so bad it s good level overall studio 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight to dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made 
__label__0 this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly inventive it s not scary it s not clever and it s not funny so what was the point of it 
__label__0 richard dix is a big not very nice industrialist who has nearly worked himself to death if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him can he find happiness for the last months of his life well he ll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler this william castle directed entry has some great moments the introduction and the depiction of richard dix s life through newsreel a la citizen kane and some intriguing plotting in the final reels dix s performance is generally pretty good but unfortunately the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do also the movie veers from a dark and fascinating beginning to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection full of nice urban ethnic types who don t mind that they aren t rich and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so this is a decent movie worth seeing but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role 
__label__1  like the first touch of pleasure and guilt like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear like a climax of contrary emotions said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel deville s le mouton enrage vincent canby in new york times however just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated love at the top which opened yesterday at the 68th street playhouse is a 1973 french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessing and possessed by ambition yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system january 27 1975 having left the evaluations up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job what may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative for romy schneider s fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the heyday of her career 9 years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here it is not trio infernal where the so to say forced escape from and the mockery of romy s sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role she plays roberte a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story s lead playboy nicolas mallet jean louis trintignant it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes romy s sex appeal is unforgettable here another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception immoral as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures innocence vs decadence genuine lust vs instrumental affair nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest may find attractive or disgusting yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept that is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild erotically unique world of the main character although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola roberte groult romy schneider and marie paul jane birkin he manipulates them makes love to them cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet he perceives them differently yet despite all of this adult maturity he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy car on the table a sort of detailed insight into male mind in a comedy like way of course finally there are very good performances which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced streetwalker marie paul jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saint saëns the tune that will ring in your ears for long therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clichés noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant le mouton enrage in sum is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life it is worth seeing as a moment in romy s career a prelude to strong eroticism a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm but aren t we humans viewers movie buffs built upon such contrasts 
__label__0 the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i ve seen in my life the plot is slow and lacking the acting is borderline comical while i love paul muni i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice the only saving grace i found with this film is it s production value the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment also the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film 
__label__0 just saw a pre screening tonight what can i say it lived up to it s mediocre trailer run though that s saying nothing at all it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn t done and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience and instead let the humorless movie play out so let s see we have the less than spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex girlfriend but he s not good enough for her check we have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character s best friend but is constantly rejected another friend being the super awkward one that can t live down seeing the positive in everything 24 7 and is thrown in for the one liners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references specifically from disney and the third guy whose name you won t ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen check we have the girl s ex boyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up not to mention the awkward family members from the main character s side check we have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed check we have the movie s funny moments come from incessant swearing people falling down or being hit scenes from the trailer and homosexual innuendos check and dare i call it a spoiler but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie check honestly this could have no wait should have been a pg 13 movie all that needed to be dropped were any f bombs honestly it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor would have gotten less media exposure and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent r rated comedies like superbad and knocked up the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn t fit in with what general people look for i bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera let s put it this way in the theater it will help you laugh because it s on the big screen and others are laughing when this movie hits showtime and you re checking it out at 2 00 pm on an off day you may be inclined to change the channel the only thing that will keep you watching is alice eve s hotness who is not quite a 10 but still very good looking aside from the main resolution this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie where everything else pretty much flies out the window so there is a main resolution but what comes of it it s never really clear cut nor does it allow the ending to be feel good with the abruptness there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie and that was the good soundtrack aside from the nice choice of 90 s alternative rock songs there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something david holmes would mix up compose i ll give them props for a great choice of sound one last thing this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer because the inadvertent yet proud pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that rock band promotion i just figured a lot of rock band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it but i say hold onto your money if this was pg 13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends i d say knock yourselves out otherwise definitely pass it doesn t try and compete with the r rated movies of the past few years and ideally it definitely isn t as good 
__label__1 first things first this movie is achingly beautiful a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter compositor the visuals blew me away every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story well it s okay it s not going to set the world on fire but if you like your futuristic blade runner esquire tales and who doesn t then you will be fine i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole i saw it at the cinema in english but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere definitely worth seeing 
__label__0 there should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like resident evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible re was a survival horror game and a damn effective one at that yet paul ws anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as resident evil so of course there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie instead alone in the dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies the plot despite the fact that it obviously isn t supposed to matter is the largest of many problems with the movie the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important as after a minute passes the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them then there s something about an orphanage some artefacts an ancient tribe some bureaucracy and some demons all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can t follow with what is going on characters move in and out of the plot like candy some having huge build ups for meaningless deaths basically what i can understand is that some demons got released and edward carnby slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex girlfriend anthropologist reid who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason then out of nowhere all hell breaks loose and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander dorff who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby it s all ridiculous and the reason i don t really understand it isn t just because it s complicated and jumbled but it leaves no room for anyone to really care instead i highly recommend that if you must see this film bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little right too bad this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens considering that this is based on a horror game not an action game it is especially annoying the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness and the rest isn t all that great either the demons look somewhat cool though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict it s all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on the same is true of dorff who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot reid is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies if they keep ruining the spirit like this it s only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middle easterns with an ak 47 and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens unlike resident evil however this one doesn t deserve a second chance as i don t think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is it s bland uninteresting and unexciting this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea it s all thrown together nothing really fits and in the end you re just glad it s over total 4 
__label__1 an occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people s buttons the 4th man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct the story s protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic catholic writer gerard krabbe with a seriously twisted sense of imagination verhoeven offers upgerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man he s shiftless delusional unable to control his urges afraid to commit tomeaningful relationships and utterly apathetic about life in general as the character himself states at one point he is a professional liar unable to recall the truth the movie opens with gerard dreaming of spiders consuming christ and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction he chases offone man a boyfriend presumably then chases another at a train station later at a lecture he meets a woman who seems to want to help him orperhaps she has more nefarious plans she quickly captures gerard in her web enticing him with sex and money having plenty of both she s also gotsecrets like three dead husbands is she lonely and genuinely looking for someone to nurture or is she a deadly black widow luring gerard to hisdeath will garard be the 4th man she kills the woman is christine soutendijk and verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she s up to this is an interesting movie with a lot of sex and intrigue it s similar to verhoeven sbasic instinct but has a lot more depth and is certainly more shocking there s a lot of very strong gay content which may make some viewers squirm highly recommended for fans of intelligentpsychological thrillers or anyone looking for something entirely new 
__label__1 my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twenty two when she made elephant walk remember i m nine so the feelings aren t sexual i just couldn t see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age she s almost seventy four but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss taylor s beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a well made point on human arrogance in the face of nature all in all a well spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video 
__label__0 as others have said no luciano is a more apt title or response to this movie title for entertainment the great opera singer should stick to singing not that he s a terrible actor it s just that this movie stinks the first 25 minutes were fine a nice family movie as it were but after that it s nothing but a boring soap opera appropriately playing a singer pavarotti as giorgio fini loses his voice a few times and the doctor pamela taylor kathryn harrold comes to the rescue the singer then falls for the doctor the doctor slowly falls for the singer the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy it s harrold that spoils things and after watching her here i am not surprised she didn t become a star there is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy good shots of san francisco and italy at least in the first half of the film i got bored and don t remember much about the second half of it 
__label__0 quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked republicans why don t they learn the dixie chicks haven t these lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they are the best hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all dan akroyd s imitation of cheney was bad i would have thought cussack could have landed better movies it wasn t funny 
__label__1 there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music score i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk i will certainly be adding it to my collection 
__label__1 love the characters and the story line very funny with plenty of action thomas ian griffith and tia carrer give great performances i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career donald southerland plays a very likable and surprisingly sympathetic burnt out hit man all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection i highly recommend this movie if you like mr and mrs smith the replacement killers l a confidential the long kiss goodnight the abyss and the whole nine yards you will love this movie 
__label__0 my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film in fact they re quite congruent with mine what gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story motive or dialogue maybe someone should tell neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn t the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director a silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of neal young the most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to young song to the heroine who is unaware of what s taken place somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of sorry neal stick with music and leave film making to steven stills 
__label__0 long on action and stunt work but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who s doing what to whom 
__label__0 once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesn t work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero he s not bad but he s really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he s not bad he s just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn t funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power i can t really recommend the film its worth a shot if you re a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment 
__label__1 i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc 2005 version which is brilliant the 1985 was adapted by arthur hopcraft who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year 2005 i remember great acting especially from rigg and elliott and moving music music in the 2005 version is far more understated but very telling just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points richard carstone is ada claire s boyfriend not esther s esther had no uncle charlie drake never played krook in either version nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the 2005 version toby was played by bernard hepton both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens great novel now read the book it s not perfect and the sentimentality may make you wince at times but i defy you not to cry and laugh 
__label__0 i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter s tom bighouseaz yahoo com the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement i have seen zatoichi 1 13 15 16 i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 usa zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing the story line was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines at one point i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects a head rolling limbs severed blood and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action and won a great following without having to resort to effects i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend this is the first zatoichi film from his studio i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films and recommend them 
__label__0 my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie impressive cast even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really i have to admit though tom hank s cameo almost made it worth it what was that about tom did you lose a bet the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though by far a classic the premise is good basinger s character struggling with existence as a pink lady is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales this happens as corbett s character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex wife motivated by what else extortion as they both make their way they have numerous run ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas soon the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer unfortunately premise doesn t mean the movie was good when watching this movie imagine you are back in the first grade when story lines and continuity aren t really important it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn t really make sense the movie tries hard but ultimately falls way way way short ultimately it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny it isn t the worst but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don t say i didn t warn you 
__label__1 come on people this movie is better than 4 i can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this and it was funny i watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully suits that purpose i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes watch this one 
__label__1 jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season late may and a good improvement on carrey s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments elements of jim s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy drama bruce almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good natured taste eight out of ten stars 
__label__0 pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other that s it for about 5 minutes we see this it s shot in black and white with tons of half naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music it looks interesting but there s no plot and really the violence inherent in this got disturbing also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible boring stupid and ocassionally disturbing really what is the point in all this i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence i really wish i could go lower than 1 
__label__0 this movie is just plain terrible poor john savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie he stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club she acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80 s punk rock and one of the olsen twins with purple hair this movie just gets all to crazy with savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head also one of the rare he quotes the elephant man and jimmy durante and i just had to laugh this just gets rediculas and then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth and you can tell that that is all to fake her son doesn t know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity i enjoy a good vampire film believe me i do but i just hated this one even the photography stinks in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of savage chasing the son of corri around till he blinds himself avoid this one 
__label__0 the cover of box of this movie has kyle minogue s name on it but she has the same destiny as drew barrymore did in scream that s the first thing that makes this movie lame they are trying to market a movie with someone that s in it for 5 minutes of course we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there s a killer going around to top it all off molly ringwald of 80 s teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film it s a good career move for molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in australia so she won t get ridiculed in the states either way this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that s in it throughout the movie we re supposed to guess who s the killer long story short remember our little friend molly she saves the day or does she this move is just plain bad rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf don t spread the horror 
__label__0 with nothing better to do i decided to check out aztec rex as it was being billed for the hell of it the silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing they actually looked like animatics those rough designs that artists later use to finish the cgi effects adding more details smoother movements etc absolutely awful looking dinosaurs which is the only reason you d probably want to sit through this anyway the one redeeming factor was the lovely dichen lachman as ayacoatl she kept my interest if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used disappointing at least the cast and crew got a free trip to hawaii where the movie was filmed 
__label__1 how truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi it is disarmingly friendly and lively it s the document of a long lost craft the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials chandu is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic it refreshes the mind it s not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work chandu has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly fun without giving away too much chandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way as to the quite sexy niece nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti the sordid vindhyan the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosi yet burton s biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor i enjoy lugosi fancy performances this serial is unjustly bashed 
__label__1 while it certainly wasn t the best movie i ve ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which can t be said for many movies these days this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sunday s character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive 
__label__1  but watch mary mcdonnell s performance closely her body language her fine body movements her subtle but powerfully effective reactions this is an accomplished artist at the top of her craft and the rest of the cast were pretty damned good too o this is perhaps the 3rd or 4th viewing for me and i see more in it each time what is this world coming to anyway r 
__label__0 some gorehound friends recommended live feed to me and basically i can t really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema the so called torture porn ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models hostel and saw with its sick twisted make up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co eds tried up suffering and begging for their lives there s no actual plot to describe five utterly brainless twenty something friends take a trip to asia one of them has asian roots but other than that i don t really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun they re clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan a simply apology clearly doesn t suffice as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat yikes live feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook even if you re used to watching independent fan boy trash cinema like this the fat bloke depicted on the cover an oriental s m executioner is admittedly quite cool and he s also the most talented of the whole bunch because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time i wouldn t exactly recommend this pile of filth but hey if you like loud hideous metal music nauseating torture footage and dim witted losers go right ahead and watch 
__label__0 i am a major fan of the horror genre i love horror slasher gore flicks of all kinds some of my favorites are the really good bad horror flicks but this movies has nothing to warrant it s viewing i m not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that s wrong with it the script is horrid the acting is horrid the fx are not even worth discussing the set is an absolute joke the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors but this vehicle left them nothing to work with suffice it to say i saw it for free feel i was robbed the time you d waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat 
__label__1 it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place first of all these ladies are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes in the yoshiwara type green houses circa 1860 give or take this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware the film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with adversity both their own and that of others in their immediate environment that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music make for a lovely ride just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world you won t be disappointed 
__label__1 i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead 2005 a little while back and since then i ve been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles he ll crack an oscar one day that s not to denigrate this film at all it s a fine story with very believable people well it s based upon the author s early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitement and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping but this film had a very special significance for me in 1957 i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it was i didn t achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but that s what you find out when you see this movie sure it s a basic family movie but that s a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids you ll all have a lot of good laughs 
__label__0 stalker is right girl sees guy girl wants guy girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him girl won t leave him alone girl pretends to be a patient girl can t stop talking about him girl pretends to love another guy or two he doesn t pay attention to her because she s annoying girl still won t leave him alone played right drake s character could have been charming but she s completely wholly unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant s character her girlfriend in cahoots is dull and sadly drake s attempt at playing charmingly screwball comes off as disturbingly demented grant is himself as usual which is fine for cary but it s as close to a phoned in performance as i ve ever seen from him the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails like in this stubbed out butt of an attempt it just stinks worse still drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic 
__label__1 i find i enjoy this show but the format needs some work first off the good attributes i like how this show will take us through the day to day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they ve allowed their lives to become this is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome intervention doesn t candy coat things and sometimes the outcome often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing is a negative outcome this makes the positive outcomes all the better another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don t have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable it s actually superior to scripted shows like the shield where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea now for the bad an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show you ll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you re thrown into the story of another get caught up in that story then suddenly you re back to the first addict or are you by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to this constant flip flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions i once heard the marketing b s reason for this poor design the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they re watching oh please clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren t big enough for an hour show so they mix two together by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block like they should it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing and the commercials if they are interested in one case but not the other i used to find these blender episodes so annoying that i d only tell my tivo to record episodes containing one addict but then it became easier just to record all of them 
__label__1 by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays miss bates are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real find is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film northam s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar
__label__0 i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at a i r as it was know as back then thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don t have to sit through the whole thing it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey the pay was good attention to detail was not a strong point for this one but who was going to know the funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed a lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and time but every one was having such a good time who cared 
__label__1 this is superb the acting wonderful sets clothes music but most of all the story itself i am amazed there aren t more reviews of this movie certainly one of the best of the 1980s it s also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great random harvest which has much the same opening crisis a middle aged unknown english w w i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name origin or anywhere he belongs he proves to be a very wealthy established man when he recovers he will not remember the years before the war but there the movies resemblances end my warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie particularly the actors ian holm alan bates ann margret what a great and surprising casting choice glenda jackson julie christie this one stays with you forever 
__label__0 the makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences in other words this film is every liberals worst nightmare the political agenda is so heavy handed here and the style of the film is so low key that it just loses steam pretty quickly regardless of which side of the fence you re on i d recommend skipping it 
__label__1 i don t doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable charles laughton and franchot tone who were all in the same race but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldn t have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasn t no split involved in his award the movie and the story by liam o flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in he s down to his last pence and if he can t get back in wants enough for passage to america there s a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and they re pretty certain it was mclaglen he hasn t the wit to really cover his own tracks he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek he also picks up a hanger on played by j m kerrigan the whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to john ford knew this world very well he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira his real name before having it anglicized was sean o fiernan preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court meek ain t in a position to say no the king s justice and writ does not run here it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the british are indeed losing their grip on the population of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time 
__label__0 personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie it s on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed slow and not very convincing if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentary but in any case since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to overall when it comes to movies i have one golden rule avoid any films that contains the word ninja 
__label__1 certain elements of this film are dated of course an all white male crew for instance and like most pre star wars science fiction it tends to take too long admiring itself but still no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did even down to the use of the electronic tonalities to provide the musical score robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots and was the inspiration for all that followed from c3po to data the plot line of course is shakespeare s the tempest morbius is prospero and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre perhaps the first 
__label__1 ok ok don t get bent out of round i was kidding bustin out is actually a better and truer title anyhoo racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x rated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs here on the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes down racist i don t know with scatman rip and the love walrus also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise it s an animated blacksploitation film that s a good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm like the lynching scene but unfortunately that s based on fact but ralphie really should have re thought that title 
__label__1 out of the first five episodes of hammer s short running hammer house of horror series this fifth episode with the wonderful title the house that bled to death is arguably the creepiest one as a great fan of the hammer studios gothic horror films for many years i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently so far i ve only seen the first five episodes and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are i will be satisfied whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations years later william nicholas ball and emma peters rachel davies move in the house with their little daughter sophie emma ridley soon after moving in however the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house which is seemingly haunted the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry growing pains episode 4 and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances the film is also well made in terms of effects cinematography and score the house that bled to death is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer fans should like to see in a short horror tale the film delivers a creepy atmosphere genuine scare moments and intelligent twists and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end overall this is highly recommendable to hammer fans 
__label__1 if you lived through the 60s this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous it s all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out don t speak too soon for the wheel s still in spin for the times they are a changin while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and it s dissemination at the time that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia influencing engineers scientists and aiding in the hyper development of computer related activities a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there you ve captured the era better than i ve seen before 
__label__0 going into a movie like i this i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills what i got was even less christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit horrified he runs up the stairs and cuts himself the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe cept for the fact he s obsessed with santa after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane dressing up like santa and starts killing non santa believing patrons and his boss an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they re about to torch him he drives his van off a cliff into the moon not the best ending i ve seen but it was original it was a slow paced boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers there was hardly any gore and even the sex scenes were toned down too boring 4 out of 10
__label__1 john schlesinger s midnight cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only x rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didn t really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didn t consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybody s talking at me i don t hear a word they re sayin make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever released young joe buck then newcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new york joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as naïve as joe ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck s classic novel of mice and men shot largely on the streets of new york midnight cowboy is a grittily realistic look at life in the slums watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso s squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role i m walkin here i m walkin here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much lauded debut in 1967 s the graduate both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting bafflingly was sylvia miles for an appearance that can t have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in true grit midnight cowboy eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt midnight cowboy is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe s past rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the achingly beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty gritty thought provoking and intensely fascinating midnight cowboy is one for the ages 
__label__1 this is a b series film noir and my vote reflects its membership in that genre i saw this film last night at a left bank cinema in paris where it opened a two week film noir run the film has some flaws yes but far too many delicious elements to ignore as the previous reviewer remarked the drumming scene is incredible b movies could tread where a movies were forbidden to enter and the plot is intriguing regarding franchot tone however i beg to disagree to me he s suitably mysterious just the right shade of creepy one must bear in mind that there s a sort of german expressionism happening here the director robert siodmark was a german who came to hollywood during the war and so an air of exaggeration fits into the whole of this film at least it does for me however it s the gorgeous ella raines who in only her third credited performance held this viewer entranced throughout the film a girl friday type with a strong resemblance to gene tierney it s a wonder that she didn t become a household name but she s so good here that i ve just ordered another film of hers impact off the internet and i can t wait to see it as well

__label__0 this movie is bad if you are thinking about watching it there is only one decent scene in the movie and it lasts about 5 seconds amanda carraway s topless scene the rest of the movie is horrible i think high school plays probably have better acting the plot makes no sense at all the set was pretty lame and it wasn t even good to make fun of it was just dull and very very bad i watched this on starz so i thought it had to be at least decent the mini description sounded like it d be alright the girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie after you have to watch some horrible music video the transitions between scenes are very abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them just cuts from one scene to another no smoothness kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is to explaining why the plot sucks the audio gets low at some points where you can barely hear it then gets loud with gay horror screams thrown in at random points in the movie it is the same sound every time this is now officially the worst movie i have ever seenacting 0 10 effects 1 10 storyline 0 10 music 3 10lame meter 1 000 000 10
__label__1 i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that s exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee robin williams intends to do in the best of times yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title but ex teammate reno hightower kurt russell isn t just going to go along with it so easily granted it s not the best movie for either man but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles to say the least check it out 
__label__0 spoilers throughout the gettaway is mostly an action movie and what action there is to shootouts chases dumpsters and much much more it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coy s this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didn t care for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry but the movie itself didn t do it for me the gettaway became really tiresome really quickly the plot is overshadowed by one fight chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in in fact by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning i don t think bassenger s eye makeup moves once during the whole picture this isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen certainly not but it isn t very good and unless one is an action movie purist i can t see really enjoying this movie because there s just not a lot here the gettaway isn t terribly original either and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull it really could have been better i think bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they don t have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives sometimes less is more after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale didn t enjoy this one to much 
__label__0 it s terrific when a funny movie doesn t make smile you what a pity this film is very boring and so long it s simply painfull the story is staggering without goal and no fun you feel better when it s finished 
__label__0 there are some stallone movies i like but this movie didn t meet my low expectations i found this movie hard to believe for example a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days also in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short cuts or plot devices also the treasury cops don t seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people also bad guys who couldn t hit the side of a barn with really high tech looking automatic weapons i liked john lithgow s villain initially but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn t care at all about any of his own bad guys or all of them getting killed eventually i just couldn t believe the character anymore not worth the price of a rental not even worth taking the time to watch 
__label__1  hey babu riba is a film about a young woman mariana nicknamed esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn sacha kicha and pop all perhaps 15 17 years old in 1953 belgrade yugoslavia the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz blue jeans or anything american it seems the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties in the wake of changing communist politics they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 the year before the film was made i enjoyed the film with some reservations the subtitles for one thing were difficult especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all perhaps the conversational pace required it but i couldn t always both read the text and absorb the scene which caused me to not always understand which character was involved i watched the movie a video from our public library with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers sense of invulnerability idealism and strong and loyal bonds to each other there is a main flashforward and it was intriguing keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis a vis the 1953 cast and what had actually happened i would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by the director jovan acin 1941 1991 
__label__1 bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it s final season it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title caprica although some things don t add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven t got far enough into the series for them to explain why i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more 
__label__1 i liked this movies its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice another rule of yash raj s film is that either hero or heroine s have only one or none parent think back to all of those films mpk suman didn t have mom hmapk salman didn t have parents and final rule is that you are 90 likely to see alock nath crying the film is good too its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough the little kid hero s nephew is well placed and deliver very good one liners the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn t get that in real life this film doesn t have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film there isn t a strong message from this film but its a good watch if you are married arranged marriage the film will remind you of what you went through and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you overall a very good looking film no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic 
__label__1 entertaining jim belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of it s a wonderful life michael caine plays a sort of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had made it big jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton not an oscar contender but good warm hearted fun 
__label__0 this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn t there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 min s there not the 90 min s claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray seriously do some research learn what really happened don t let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
__label__0 well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie and it wasn t even worth that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain i am guessing neagle despite her glory awards and reputation is a homely british gal who can t sing or dance or act some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic director herbert wilcox neagle s husband always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing 
__label__1 a long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released he doesn t remember first seeing the movie but he also doesn t remember life before it he does remember the first star wars themed gift he got a shoebox full of action figures from the original set he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be but years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he s ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection it s now legendary in this boy s family how the last action figure he needed anakin skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years until he got into college trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets don t ask it s a northern illinois university thing i can t review star wars as a movie it represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood there s no separating it in my mind from christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up in the winter my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth i was always han solo my friends dad built them a kick ass tree house and that served as the ewok village they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda s home i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to star wars and i think people either just understand that or they don t i don t get the appeal of lord of the rings or star trek but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas s films i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time every time i put them in the dvd player i feel like i m eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker grade for the entire trilogy a

__label__1 i was hooked from beginning to end great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump but to make you go what the f ck did i just see all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about so i won t rehash what has already been said i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me i even had a bad dream after seeing it and i am a true horror fan not easily spooked by tripe like the grudge or even silent hill what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys what would my personal horror be my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you the best part of this movie is that it is subtle it s not about bogeymen that jump out at you alien invasions or tons of gore it s the opposite the horror you create in your own mind the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it s power over them simply the men ask for the one thing they desire and they get it but not in the way they imagined so on the one hand they get what they wish for from an occult book but may ultimately wish they hadn t sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be 
__label__1 writer director henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film panic from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast william h macy tracy ullman john ritter neve campbell donald sutherland barbara bain david dorfman brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly un funny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see panic is the story of a hit man alex macy who actually works for his father sutherland he covers his true profession by doing mail order work by all appearances he and his wife ullman and their son sammy dorfman are a typical suburban family unhappy with his life alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ritter telling only his mother bain in the waiting room he meets a young woman campbell to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist when alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist this is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mother s knowledge who kills to please his father but also can t stand up to him and quit his rage is so deep seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son and it s finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression when it s time for panic to moves it does quickly panic doesn t seem panicked at all in fact it moves very slowly but it moves slowly not because it s poorly made the slowness is deliberate mirroring alex s own psyche slowly coming out of the fog by making a decision about sara the campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they don t jive and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche sammy s william macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater it s too adult too small too subtle too character driven and too good 
__label__0 honestly i don t know what s funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board masterpiece s review had me in tears that s so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but it s a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair good times this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless you re looking for a good laugh 
__label__0 yes he is no not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies pintilie is the naked emperor so to speak it s big time for someone to state the truth this impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old man s body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of niki ardelean he used to embarrass poor coca bloss by telling her oh coca how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all 
__label__1 it s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes and none more so that september 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism no this documentary didn t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9 11 rather the filmmakers brothers gédéon and jules naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby probation firefighter to join them in an ny firehouse home to ladder 1 and engine 7 but their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad who informed me of the above few minutes later he told me there was another and that the wtc was under attack by the time i arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hour the filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action the other camera held by the other brother was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of new yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save lives we began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures it s not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters it s as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7 
__label__0 i remembered the title so well to me it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles and it had vincent massey s voice from behind whiskers well flora robson was great her next signature for me would be 55 days at peking the same role but with different sumptuous gowns and the same voice as for the armada it was a subtext i like black and white films was everything done in elizbethan times at night it was talky and difficult to fathom at times i couldn t tell which was the love interest was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada apparently it worked for the empire but not for the script this might have been more accurate historically but bette davis had more engaging scripts and i missed daylight

__label__0 shown in australia as hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden the infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of total recall there didn t seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money 
__label__1 previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and i m a guy in his 60 s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 7 0 rating by imdb com users well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while 29 0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 10 7 gave it a 1 rating these 10 7 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 7 0 in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me i ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn t like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 0 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point heaven s gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 23 2 10 ratings and 9 2 1 ratings overall rating of 6 1 big top pee wee 1988 got 4 3 10 ratings and 9 9 1 ratings overall rating of 4 5 cat people 1982 got 6 1 10 ratings and 2 6 1 ratings overall rating of 5 8 blind date 1987 got 3 0 10 ratings and 2 8 1 ratings overall rating of 5 3 jumpin jack flash 1986 got 4 4 10 ratings and 3 7 1 ratings overall rating of 5 2 what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got 10 7 1 ratings compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor 
__label__1 i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in nürnberg and it was superb i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion xylophone player influenced the mood of the film but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied i highly recommend this film the costumes were fantastic and creative the sets were opulent and exotic and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking as is typical of silent film tragedies unfortunately i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried the story of this second film begins after siegfried s death when kremhild gudrun in the norse versions of the story begins to plan her revenge against her brothers also i watched this film in german i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge it was difficult to read the subtitles what do you call that in silent films at first because of the old style german script so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your k s f s and s s in the old script :)
__label__1 french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary everyday suburban life this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l emploi du temps time out a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job as is the penchant of french filmmakers many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places giving a cinema verite feel to the story yet l emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage most notably a swiss mountain retreat running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production jacques audiard s gritty crime caper sur mes levres read my lips actually to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that as with the earlier french release it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them in a paris construction firm carla a shy diminutive young woman sits at her desk sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla s desk to chat and drop off their half finished styrofoam cups of coffee partially deaf carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend s baby when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load carla fears she may lose her job at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant preferably male as if she were at a personals agency he should be 25 years old and clean cut with extensive computer and filing skills when the agency sends over an unkempt menacing looking young man carla is both shocked and intrigued they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery where carla interviews her prospective assistant when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison carla initially wants nothing to do with paul but has a change of heart and hires him on although she is basically kind toward her helper carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips later when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on a furious carla asks paul s help in seeking revenge on the man from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock most notably rear window where carla s lip reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars there is a teasing on again off again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars that being said what one carries away from this movie isn t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the pervasive view a of a modern day city in this case paris where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy garish nightlife where sex drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters unlike hollywood productions this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared it s hitchcock with the gloves off

__label__1 a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita strindberg for me the jig saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be said sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all 
__label__0 like most people i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty bolo yeung plastered all over the box and the assumption from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film that this film is all about the beast from the east kickin ass for 90 minutes however to my disappointment chinese hercules is to bolo yeung what no retreat no surrender was to jean claude van damme and fearless tiger was to erm bolo yeung maximum exposure on video box minimum actual screen time oh well the storyline is pretty basic stuff but it was well done peaceful kung fu fighter played by chen hui min accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again he then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter dont quite know how that works but never mind meanwhile the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters giving them exclusive use of the pier as a result the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach where they unite against their boss the gangster boss and his hulking henchman bolo yeung while the film was quite watchable mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of bolo i had a few problems with it firstly the bad dubbing but of course thats a given in old kung fu films but also the film tended to drag between the various fight scenes and as for the fight scenes themselves i found them to be over long badly choreographed apparently by jackie chan badly shot and at times performed by people who didn t seem to have any martial arts ability in fact most of the fights in this film weren t fights at all just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance finally the hero played by chen hui min i ve never seen any other films with this guy in but at no point was i rooting for him not only did he look wimpy and on the verge of tears at all times but i found his insistence on not fighting infuriating i understood his reasoning but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually and fight a bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were pinning their hopes on a guy they ve never even seen fight really the big saving grace in this film was the presence of bolo yeung not only is he as huge and brutal as ever he has some great funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight on film the guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star the guy scares the life out of me but i m sure i wasn t the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for bolo all through the end fight all in all then a below average kung fu film lifted several huge notches due to you know who i ve never met a person who didn t think bolo yeung was great the man s a legend

__label__0 cash now played by khrystyne haje in for angelina jolie has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland after her protector has died from old age said protector was played by elias koteas an actual decent actor and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash she leads a group of burned out cyborgs that includes william katt evan lurie and a human scientist played by zach galligan against bounty hunter richard lynch malcolm mcdowell has two minutes of screen time as lynch s employer cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature the problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as mcdowell katt and galligan are given little to do haje is indeed a whiny heroine and lynch is too over the top as usual and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun bad as it s hilarious predecessor the one with van damme the second one is just dull also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has as an action flick this is routine and by the numbers b movie stuff and it is competently made that s the only thing positive i can say about it 1 2 out of 4 poor 
__label__0 genghis cohn is a very mildly entertaining british movie about a german police commissioner in the late 1950 s who is haunted by the ghost of a jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under hitler in the ss the ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a jew to atone for the murders he committed otto the german policeman actually knows this ghost s name because the last thing he did before he died was said in yiddish kiss my ass the policeman didn t speak yiddish so he asked around until he found the meaning the kiss my ass left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian s name genghis cohn there are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner and there are no helpful clues the men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher the butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich so the commissioner is a suspect the first man is killed while making love to the butcher s wife so the butcher is a suspect but the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife all the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking i think i might be a bit angrier than the ghost of genghis cohn if i was killed like he was he seems to be very good natured about it as if he was just in a mild car accident i can only guess that it is because it is a british movie and they are known for being a very polite people he uses some of his material from his stand up routing and i just didn t find it very funny i gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy i thought it should have been a little more serious than it was the movie turns out to be a murder mystery where did this come from and it seemed that genghis should have been more helpful than he was the movie gave me a tiny look into jewish culture but was only skin deep do all jews love liver and onion sandwiches do they all say shtoop and meshuganah in their daily vocabulary isn t there more important stuff that we should know about the culture i saw this movie at a jewish community center in berkeley ca and i was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white i have no gray or white hair there were 18 of us and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie there were 2 main concerns expressed there 1 the movie was way too light hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 as the holocaust survivors are dying off future generations will not know what really happened i thought that this second concern was ridiculous and i told them i thought they didn t need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies like myself the murder of 6 000 000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten i write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day 
__label__0 having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style technique to match the larger scale of this movie i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard hitting fact based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities but this is not it this plays like a bottom to mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s e g ss experiment camp etc perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually granted it has a greater scope and more people running around but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots spiced up with the occasional poorly executed shock sequence the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power watch channel 4 s the holocaust aired recently still running as of 1 no 2006 for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent in context use of actual footage this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie rating 3 5 as exploitation 1 as a treatment of the subject

__label__1 okay first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion first off bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century if that s what you re looking for go somewhere else just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy it s supposed to make you feel good and you re supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished secondly the acting though not halle berry in monster s ball is still good the movie doesn t need acting like that honestly so don t look for it it s a family movie if that s what you wanted you wouldn t or shouldn t even be looking into this movie honestly lastly it has a really cute story i think it s thought out well and it s entertaining to watch it s also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you re finished if you re looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you lyndsay
__label__1 of course the average sci fi battle star gallactica fan will hate this that kind of makes me happy i don t like those cheesy sci fi shows especially battle star gallactica and that is why i like this show the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this the unconventional sci fi way and it was worth it i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci fi nerds this is probably the most promising show since lost it has the most interesting clever and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime from young teens running around shooting guns to and extremely well balanced and complex script to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better most anime is too confusing 
__label__0 what a great word re imagining is isn t that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv 2004 a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of re imagining though it played a role still why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someone s idea and reshaping it or re imagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it it s like coles cliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing scheme so what s wrong with this one well i ll start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apart this set up leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story it s noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original film s story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romero s film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this re imagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesn t bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romero s version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you don t care when or who goes what matters is how they go what else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story it s really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few one liners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from it s number one spot in the box office well done zombies 
__label__0 it s pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraph long plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the bleep was going on alas to no avail this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story it s like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations newsflash to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody i ve never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didn t really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn t into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something don t book yourself as the lead if you can t act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the white latino issue yes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college age males who wear baseball hats that s what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story s antagonist as for the maya character she didn t seem like a real person anyway i m ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made 
__label__0 there s something frustrating about watching a movie like murder by numers because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll there s no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra bullock and ben chaplin s homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on although bullock is strong in her role it s not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben chaplin s talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated birthday girl as well as chris penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isn t even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well it s too bad they weren t in a much better all around film barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line it s worth a rent if you re a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks 
__label__0 the last station director michael hoffman s melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy begins with fog and sleep tolstoy christopher plummer lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his movement people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism vegetarianism sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away his wife sophia helen mirren wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov paul giamatti who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death observing all of this is tolstoy s new steward bulgakov james mcavoy a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife hoffman s script which is based on the novel by jay parini quite often veers itself into confused territory building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don t resolve themselves in any satisfying way the scope of the film is grand and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks and those of pacifists like ghandi it unfortunately doesn t it s un unpickable building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness the three way relationship between the church the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy for example is referenced often in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy there are a ton of details in the film but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered overburdened energetic but unfortunately pointless at its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy and that story as baffling and cramped as it is is the reason to watch the film mirren and plummer are unsurprisingly the best things in the film plummer s tolstoy is vague at once confused and resolute apprehensive and full of joy and certainty mirren s sophia is in full panic in a righteous lather forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas they re great performances all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple s place in history and the script s ability to support that both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there giammati and mcavoy both talented actors are unable to do the same and giamatti s chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once either but rather a cipher a stand in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses the scope of this thing never boils down to anything it hitches along getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else it s interesting and pretty but ultimately unrewarding 4 5 10
__label__1 now for all of the cinematographical buffs out there this film may not rank high on your list of things to see but if you know anything about plot development profound truth and the intentions that this film the series had you d understand my p o v granted the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end but the film is biblically accurate and justifiably scares viewers into thinking about what may be i m a christian not due to this movie but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my savior the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions it s not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god but rather a means to get your attention as a christian i know i ll not be left behind and thanks to movies like this i can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment acting and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer this is a movie you shouldn t not only see but feel with your heart and soul 
__label__0 a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas nowhere close i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time but i read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value i was unable to find it though see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies i know i am not but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person he even tried to get simon garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs of course they rejected 
__label__1 i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown up i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times

__label__0 as a former submariner this was one of the worst submarine movies i have ever seen first of all a mutiny aboard any us naval vessel particularly a nuclear powered trident submarine in unthinkable these men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission the responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the most junior crew member i could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the captain and the executive officer an executive officer who acted as the character played by denzel washington did would be relieved of his duties and court martialed then drummed from the navy it is no surprise the navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film lastly if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection they don t slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway i was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway loud music would never be tolerated i know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous i would not recommend this movie to anyone

__label__1 most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog the tim burton batmans had it as did in an even more grotesque manner sin city with dick tracy producer director star warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde dick tracy is filled joyfully with archetypes and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities villains like the stooge shoulders lips the brow mumbles the blank pruneface spud chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously if at the time movies like batman and underrated teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic book outline dick tracy is more old school it s a story of cops and crooks or rather a cop detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguably his biggest performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style but with no such luck there s also a little kid called simply the kid charlie korsmo who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would ve been imagined and tracy s love interest in tess and then there s the nightclub dame madonna who probably doesn t give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesn t have for her then there s convoluted dealings with taking tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice meantime as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions dick tracy adds on the wink and nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes it s a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers i e sin city which can be justifiably compared to beatty s film we re driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old i m almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences as story music detail and a few big punches and gun shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isn t more than it needs to and there s a heap load of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of pacino s references to other figures in quotes revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits dick tracy is a hard boiled fantasy to the finest degree it s filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic book movies i e pg 13 fare and for the adults its throw back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle even dustin hoffman hams it up and he barely says an audible word 
__label__1 i thought king solomon s mines was beautifully done my only reservation was alison doody her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain it was nice seeing a seasoned rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired fair skinned actors like val kilmer brad pitt etc he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie this version cannot be compared with the 1950 s version with stewart grainger it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated i am looking forward to seeing this once more and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles

__label__1 my first exposure to whale music was the rheostatics album of the same name that i bought around 1993 i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album which remains in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington s book i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it an amazing read i have since re read the book numerous times each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music i found the film in 1996 on video i haven t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film but this one worked for me the role of claire could have been cast differently but overall i think that paul quarrington s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius the movie deals with family relationships love and finding someone who understands i would strongly recommend whale music to not only music fans but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world 
__label__0 honestly i can t understand why this movie rates so well here nor why bakshi himself thought it was his finest film i m a huge fan of bakshi s earlier work particularly heavy traffic and wizards but frankly wizards 1977 was the last good film he made after that he turned to the mainstream beginning with the diabolical lord of the rings and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight frank frazetta for fire and ice what can i say the story is puerile the animation is tv quality i insist that it s considerably worse than his 70 s stuff and whereas wizards had real imagination quirkiness some gorgeous background art and an underground adult sensibility fire and ice is just designed for 14 year old boys and has the intellectual clout of robinson crusoe on mars yes if you liked the gor books you might like this in my view though this was just another blip in the slide in quality after wizards from which bakshi never recovered though he s done some decent tv stuff fairly recently 4 5 out of 10

__label__1 this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on nabooboo island we got it and have watched it repeatedly since in fact we ve rented it several times since there are very few non animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to what a nice change from dumbo and the little mermaid the acting is outstanding the songs are compelling they get deep into your head and you can t help but singing along the storyline while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it s own way and there is something new to see every time you watch i ve heard it compared to mary poppins but i think they are two very different movies both excellent but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary poppins this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won t mind complying with there are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and i don t feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie 
__label__0 the angry red planet quickie review like the man from planet x this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing meaning we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo science masquerading as science fiction and yes it s another classic released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound by midnite movies so the main reason to watch this film oh it s definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars what you thought angry red planet referred to neptune prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the puny female member of the crew it d be somewhat offensive by today s standards if it weren t so damn funny but mars is the real reason we re watching this thing the film is generally black and white but mars well mars is screaming bloody red it s filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness it s really quite a sight as are the ha ha aliens viewers are to witness the best being the ratbatspidercrab you think that s a joke that s what they call it in the movie it s a gigantic chimera small puppet of a thing combining traits of rats bats spiders and crabs it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh t out of our heroic crew there are other weird and poorly imagined aliens to be seen but that one takes the cake eventually after their harrowing experience on mars the sexist crew boards their ship and returns to whatever planet it was they came from this ain t for everyone science fiction film buffs curiosity seekers and some general film buffs fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one if they never got to it on the show 2 10 modern score 6 10 nostalgia score 4 10 overall www residenthazard com 
__label__0 as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film i have a different take on why the film was such a flop first any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial they are two different animals the novel is probably intended as a satire but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author s uniformly cynical thrust and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain think again a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack more celebrity than author always looking for new grist for his self absorbed mill it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start unlike true satire which translates very well into film polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior but in a single minded attack on specific people whether real or fictional straw men who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start free of the writer s influence or interference having said that i too find fault with the casting it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up but that real talents like tom hanks f murray abraham and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire but it fails to come even close 
__label__0 don t even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel it s too terrible for words the movie that is not the bronchitis the acting is deplorable richard grieco hams it up as a trigger happy gun slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film the script is dismal peppered with clichéd lines are you ready pardner purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims dire avoid :)
__label__0 this tiresome plodding las vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in it s something you look at if you have absolutely nothing else better to do the only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous stella stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she ll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears many great shots of mid 70s las vegas when it was still a cool place to visit and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well otherwise one big yawn the rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still ain t worth it in my humble opinion 
__label__0 i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie the wwf style cinemtography will make you cry where s the tripod the filmakers aimed high but sorely missed their mark 
__label__1 this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome the story line is awesome too it s just basically a wonderfull movie for all ages i found the last battle scene awesome basically this was a great flick 
__label__0 it is such a strange movie you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh athon strange comes to mind again and again shot amateurishly acted even worse and the directions maybe none the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit see it if you got time to kill but don t don t even try to take it seriously supposed to be a tribute to porno holocaust since i haven t seen it from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad should have given it 1 10 but it did give me a good laugh or two so it gets a 3 excessive gore the only thing somebody worked on stay away if you are squeamish more gore than laughs wonder if the makers had a laugh making it 
__label__0 judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it s time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculousone wonders why anil doesn t buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he is the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80 s the johny paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn t fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny paresh irritates farida is decent
__label__1 the late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times while most of these were rip roaring swashbucklers about the wild superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like errol flynn and tyrone power gunga din is very different in its focus scope and tone part of gunga din s secret is the division of labour in its writing team the original story is by ben hecht and charles macarthur two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of hollywood s golden age however the actual screenplay was the work of joel sayre and fred guiol both of whom guiol especially had a background in comedy what we get from these four is a plot that is well balanced and engaging yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies usually featuring one or two comic relief supporting players but they didn t use laughs in the way gunga din does here all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes we see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light hearted brawl the first main battle scene is an even handed blend of action and gags in the style of the silent swashbucklers of douglas fairbanks sr something which the flynn and power vehicles largely failed to replicate towards the middle of gunga din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot however the continual forays into comedy such as the spiked punch routine make this slow portion bearable producer director george stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing himself having cut his teeth at the hal roach studios and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point this was his first full on action feature and he does a startlingly good job in particular his use of moving point of view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating he also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era a sense of real dread and fear he sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters the portrayal of the abandoned village and the thuggee cultists cry of kali is genuinely haunting this dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here causing us to worry for these likable characters and making the comedy a greater relief of tension a real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience we are made aware of din visually as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him because of this we are given the impression that din is not an important figure within the regiment but he quickly becomes a notable character to us and crucially a sympathetic one as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men but the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast fear not for gunga din has a top notch one victor mclaglan and cary grant were ideally suited to the material since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy grant in particular is at his best largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over the top whooping and capering that was his trademark douglas fairbanks jr is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions but he is by no means bad and of course there is sam jaffe cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity i have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of errol flynn and tyrone power and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that i love absolutely but gunga din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichéd defiant damsel it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy in a way that few pictures have done before or since and that s fabulous 
__label__0 dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film the way it is shot lit acted etc just doesn t make sense it s all so bad it is difficult to watch loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom there seems to be no normal person in the entire film and the existence of the outside world is well it just doesn t exist and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden this film is beyond stupidity zero 
__label__0 just below the surface lies what a simply awful movie is what as other viewers have justifiably commented the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain now that s smart menace foreboding sexual tension for those read dull contrived dull contrived and dull overly contrived i want to say thank god for mia sara s shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all so it just becomes yet another contrivance do yourself a favour and give this a miss 
__label__1 i like the good and evil battle i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done he wasn t the smart cocky know it all he usually plays he shows heart and a more humble humor the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope 
__label__0 the acting is bad ham all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children assuming they have below average iqs i realize that it was meant for kids but so is malcom in the middle yet they still throw in adult humor and situations what should we expect from a show lead by bob saget the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a man s groin which is probably why he stopped hosting america s funniest home videos parents do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up dumberer 
__label__0 the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else i wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead 
__label__0  but a lousy film as maltin says this was christopher lee s attempt to make a serious horror film well it is serious too serious the plot is silly and slow something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually dozed off a few times the film is sooooo dull the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee but this was probably a labor of love for both they often complained about horror movies being too violent well this has no violence avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia this will put you to sleep 
__label__1 there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set that 70 s show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends ashton is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough think of ashton with demi moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo gaffney who played don s girlfriend joanne i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlie s angels i loved brooke shields playing jackie s mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but i hope they don t stay too far away too long i wish the show s creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future 
__label__0 my friends and i went into this movie not knowing what to expect but hoping for the best when we came out we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was though not the worst movie i ve ever seen i definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters maybe have a friend rent it for you it s not even worth the rental cost either if you really want to see it when a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what s going on until the last five minutes there s really not much that can be said in its defense the acting was decent more than you d expect to get from this movie and some of the shots were good but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script this movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out i went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind i recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead 
__label__1 this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering it s made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it s story lines are complex and twisting and it s characters show realistic depth and dimension the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking while it s first season might be a little shaky it s final few are well thought out and well shot some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise but these fans don t take no for an answer i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike 10 10 hidden frontier crew make it so 
__label__0 the 80 s were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson starting with 1982 s death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from 89 bronson s screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness d w ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson s character s daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge i m not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizen aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i ve thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was off screen though well implied what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the 60 s and 70 s like the mechanic death wish from noon til 3 once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc 
__label__0 despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the grunt but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that s all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous it s not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world war ii films twelve o clock high has very little action but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension the exception to the story of g i joe is a brief battle segment titled city under siege on the dvd which takes place in italy admittedly it is one of the most fast paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie but alas the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight another turn off is pvt dondaro played by wally cassell who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a pervert by contrast sgt warnicki is a sympathetic if flawed man as he says to capt walker mitchum when volunteering for another patrol every step forward is a step closer to home but that last step one patrol too many drives him over the mental brink too bad the rest of the movie doesn t do justice to some otherwise fine touches as for meredith s portrayal of pyle it is practically comatose 
__label__1 i was a kid crazy about michael jackson his music his dancing he was and is the greatest of all times few days ago a friend gave me a present moonwalker dvd i just couldn t believe it so i took my time and saw the movie again after a lot of years and it kicked me back in time i almost cried not because of michael jackson but of the good old times i remembered back than when i went to his concerts enjoying music and dancing the movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid you can truly see the parody that michael went through his life thank you michael jackson to bring me back to those great times to your great music and dancing it s a shame that people has forgotten you i didn t because you gave me great moments with your music all the best to you where ever you are out there 
__label__1 like many people here i started out finding my patience being tried by this film by the end i actually shed a few tears it seems to be in the nature of most old films to drag for 7 8th length and then catch fire right at the end older film goers learned to bide their time patiently through the slow parts calm in the knowledge that the big payoff is on the way but that isn t quite accurate you see to earlier audiences what are to us the slow parts were the main body of the story they watched and found anecdotal and thematic interest there modern audiences post spielberg are in a constant state of waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when they see older films it s the inflation problem of modern movies well that isn t going to happen it is not necessary to apologize for these films it is simply that you have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm when you watch them at this point the difference between avatar and the informer is like the difference between euripides and a traveling production of rent think about it for a minute or two not to strain at the obvious but euripides still deserves a hearing the exciting part for most modern viewers begins with the ira tribunal scene and escalates to the final couple of minutes which if you are at all on board or even paying attention by that time will tear your heart out it s not some high tone universal abstract plea for forgiveness it s a plea from one dimwit and those who feel sorry for the big lummox for a little mercy it s that personal and that embarrassingly naked an appeal for after being mad at gypo irritated at him thinking this is the dumbest character of all time you finally find yourself won over by the scene of gypo s erstwhile girlfriend pleading to another woman to talk her man into going easy him the film may be sentimental but the sentimentality is not cheap as some here have charged there s a matter of life and death that plays out here and as long as you take the proposition of one life to a customer seriously it s sentimentality wrung out of the most serious stuff 8 of 10 and the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours if you are reading this we have all asked for more ever more faster ever faster until we cannot put ourselves in 1935 just yesterday really as easily as we should be able 
__label__1  spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies i ve ever seen i don t understand why this movie didn t get better critics it s funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was 11 and i really fell in love with it 2 days later i got it on vhs p till today i ve shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think that s the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance that s sad si has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you don t get mad about it it s worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum :P
__label__0 i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought ana lucia and libby s deaths were unnecessary and really depressing then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode gah i can t handle it i liked this show for the first season but it definitely declined in the second season i found jack and locke s little religious feud to be annoying the deaths of rodriguez watros characters was the final straw i give this episode a 4 10 for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend j j abrams i hope his series in the future will improve on this one 
__label__1 although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism it is in fact nothing of the sort it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico s post columbian odyssey as even a passing glance at mexico s history will attest in contrast to like water for chocolate erendira expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain proud aloof sorrowful and above all else weighed down with history the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the outcome of history i e the present is always obscure since we are too close to it for honest evaluation refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director given the ambitions of the film erendira is gorgeous a big screen experience would be ideal if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening but if not vhs is better than never seeing it at all 
__label__0  spoilers i rented tesis or thesis in english on the strength of director alejandro amenabar s later effort the others based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror instead i wound up with the most tedious preposterous excuse for a lame brained slasher movie i ve seen since the german film anatomie which this one kinda reminded me of the plot has potential but it s thrown away within the first 20 minutes it revolves around innocent n pretty psychology student angela s ana torrent a jessica harper deadringer thesis on the subject of violence in films through some far fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here she winds up in possession of a snuff tape on which two men torture mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera angela and her horror buff friend chema fele martinez are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who s responsible for it this leads to well nothing they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl s killers since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls there is only one proper clue the type of camera the killers used is discovered and that s a a really weak one and b wheeled out in the first 20 minutes the rest of the so called unravelling just occurs through blind luck increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time seriously amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he s clearly never read a detective book in his life the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist in tesis potential spoiler ahead the killer s identity is guessed correctly by the amateur detectives almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas throws his hands up and says ok ya got me it was him after all as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes no such luck you re watching the wrong movie if that s what you re after the only thing that drags tesis down further from just being a dumb badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous muddled up point about violence in films i have no idea what stance it s attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided confused psychobabble in between the rest of the gibberish and say look at me i m political the final scenes in which the point of the movie is supposedly hammered home are so utterly absurd and puerile one can t help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this if he doesn t he certainly should this is total amateur night at the slasher house stuff overall i can t believe i wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this just hoping something might happen the urban legend of snuff films and that is basically all they are despite the way this film tries to suggest they re some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films videodrome anyone but it s so easy to step over the line into childlike wouldn t it be cool if territory with it ie my little eye tesis hits an all time low for the snuff movie genre on every level this one is better left dead and buried i ll award it a 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting but that s all it s getting 
__label__0 i don t know maybe it s because i m brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on it s not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties i m not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and stds i liked the scene with caridad s mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people 
__label__0 star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning long time inmate twitch kurupt gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re opened alcatraz he claims it s to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose there he crosses paths with burke bill goldberg a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself twitch despite being less muscular is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black s gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke but the sh t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics cortez robert madrid takes twitch s girlfriend and burke s daughter hostage steven seagal doesn t do sequels reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie so despite this being a dvd sequel the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg steve doesn t even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end but there s a reason he hasn t done much work since universal soldier 2 and that s because he s not much of an actor and not much of an action star either managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one liners support wise veterans from the first film kurupt and tony plana have merely jumped at the chance of extra work this is a film that s tried to copy the style of the original quite well with the dim lighting dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it it does this quite well unfortunately it can t contend with an unengaging hero an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along 
__label__1 the japanese cyber punk films have never really done a whole lot for me but of the handful that i ve seen most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining meatball machine is no exception the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts takes control of their bodies turns them into necroborgs and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other apparently as a game for the enjoyment of said parasites the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other but whose love affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites and are forced to fight each other it becomes a test of human will vs the parasite s control over their physical bodies meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo as most cyber punk films are and for good reason there are definitely some thematic parallels though the films are definitely different there s plenty of fun splattery moments in meatball machine and the creature borg fx are definitely the high point a mixture of tetsuo meets gwar that are both elaborate and inventive depending on your taste for these types of films meatball machine may or may not be your thing if you enjoy hyper kinetic cyber punk films with a healthy dose of splatter this one s for you 7 10
__label__0 this is is a thoroughly unpleasant if slickly made movie i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum two good actors and because the plot line a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution sounded promising the movie is billed as a comedy sorta what we have is an endless series of shots you should pardon the pun of people in dimly lit and elegant if somewhat surreal interiors shooting each other in the head stomach kneecap foot heart no part of the anatomy is avoided it seems while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue some of which is supposed evidently to be humorous in a sort of post modern way goldblum s dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card and he wears a single facial expression a sardonic grin throughout ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can burt reynolds does a cameo the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop but i somehow missed them good move on their part the whole thing is cold sterile mechanical and unsavory an heir i suspect to the style of pulp fiction fargo and natural born killers if you liked those you ll probably like this 
__label__0 okay i ve tried and i ve tried but i still don t get this guy maddin thing tales from the gimli hospital left me cold that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story department and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring i m glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino they re empty homages to better more imaginative films films that advanced the art form or broke new ground and are all style and no substance no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesn t write embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on intertitles the bottom line is maddin s schtick is clever clever film making for aspiring film majors 
__label__1 i first came across my tutor friend accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing prior to that i d never watched any korean films before in my whole life so mtf was really the first korean film i ve ever watched and what a delightful surprise i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which i ve been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience i thought there re quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious witty and original too i watched mtf the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprise comic effect on me kind of mitigated that has however by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film instead something else came through this time it moved me the story about how two young seemingly enemies who re utterly incompatible get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days to me su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that separates them from people like say ji hoon s sassy girlfriend the film is divided into two distinct parts the 1st part deals with the fight between su wan and ji hoon and is more violent and faster in pace after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the in ji hoon s opinion provocative dance things start to change the pace slows down and ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss just one last comment i find this to be a bit unbelievable the fact that a 21 year old self proclaimed bad boy would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his cool is just a little odd i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isn t really what his appearance seems btw kwong san woo ji hoon does have a sexy body and perfect figure mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time ;)
__label__0 i recently saw this at the 2009 palm springs international film this is the feature length directorial debut of veteran dutch actress monique van de ven and based on my observation it should be her last i hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene this film immediately leaves you scratching your head as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the taliban controlled mountains afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them they get out of their vehicle to watch as talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers machine guns rifles handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck bob waldemar torenstra starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend since they are with hand throwing distance they can t be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away his girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it s opening the following year bob finds himself on assignment for national geographic on a dutch resort island where he meets kathleen sophie hilbrand and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers avoid this film i would give it a 4 0 out of 10 
__label__1 in one of her first movies romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18 learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony kitschy and campy though surprisingly faithful to the real events this romantic piece is irresistible seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm on that front one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen but then one remembers that in 1954 austria was still under occupation by allied troops including british ones maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film 
__label__1 spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well growing up in the 80 s i enjoyed this movie it s plot and all the actors i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did the plot is fun a group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life 
__label__0 kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeare s obscure rarely produced comedy into a 1930s era musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english class the musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimer s contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and you d be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass 
__label__1 i ve seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg s expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettie you ll experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time 
__label__1 class reunion is a very underated comedy gem it s 1982 and the 1972 class of lizzie borden high return for there 10 year reunion among them are the usual stereotypes the hunk babe the fat guy nerd etc but the former students are in for a bumpy night one of their classmates is walter baloer the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation despite the dark premise this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags set pieces to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun airplane movies you ll love this what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry a great comedy which deserves a wider audience 
__label__1 the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects it s scary suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 and with all the lights off and the volume turned up it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life i managed to get hold of a copy and now i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they re in for and all i can do is laugh with glee as for the film it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client mrs alice drablow this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story but then arthur attends the funeral and from that scene on we do not feel safe we are constantly on edge and biting our nails and that goes on for the next hour or so until the final thrilling finale a warning to all new viewers though do not watch this alone 
__label__1 after the success of die hard and it s sequels it s no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of die hard on a movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallone s career cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all it s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs you ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as travers he may of been henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely can t be it really does look like ralph waite s frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death mention too must go to former london s burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football yes you can t help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kicking so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you re looking for qaulen he s the one wearing the helicopter 
__label__0 this isn t a film it s a 111 minute evangelical christian sermon draped over red state america s 1 sport high school football another of the long earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours dialogue like you won the big one when you accepted christ loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director coach alex kendrick s sunken black eyes then there are the parables two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it which one do you think god blessed this rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax in the course of which coach asks his trepidous back up kicker son do you think god could help you make that kick it s the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith based funding ad infinitum if only the evangelical christian bush administration s hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become devout after their example behold that poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finale urging his team on crying who s with me while the devout eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the lord s work so do you think our terrified back up makes his kick to vanquish those self centrist goliaths well we all know zealots can t lose put it this way transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the middle east replace the christian proselytizing and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a taliban vs superpower parable which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute luckily they won t care nor need to like coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame the answers are all right here in this book and the christian right will devour this on their way to their rapture that final victory they have prepared their fields for 
__label__1 i just watched i q again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with einstein playing twinkle twinkle little star on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career an especially unique situation for the 1950 s the time in which this movie is set i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children so please don t think i am some staunch women s libber it s wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine s fiance a clinical behavioral researcher the message to me is that we are not what we do but who we are is defined by so much more no labels there are so many little gags and one liners that are almost throwaways if you don t watch and listen carefully i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium there are 3 instruments protractor ruler etc hanging on the right from the chalk ledge in the next camera shot there only 2 in the credits on our video it lists tony shaloub s character as bob watters not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb i highly recommend this movie it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations but has lots more substance than many give it credit for not only that what a great cast is assembled here watch it and enjoy 
__label__0 sadly i don t remember the book anymore but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace this film represents a typical german production of low quality it does not hold my attention although the story itself is good it is just badly adabted at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated they have no nuances in their performances even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren t cannot rescue this poor spectacle however there s hope i ve been told that the films following this one are getting better and better so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn t deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon 
__label__0 my complaints here concern the movie s pacing and the material at hand while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective too often the material selected to highlight simply isn t very interesting such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment tc or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown also the movie crawls along in covering c 1920 1939 and then steams through the war years in sum the film is little better than a history channel documentary with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels life still i found it wanting 
__label__1 the movie shocked me personally i had herd mostly bad buzz well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes the best thing about the movie is it s consistency with the relationship there were no ex s popping up or characters threatening the relationship i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate they date something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie but this movie did not follow that mold we actually experienced the relationship and it s flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also it s no my fair lady but it is a spirited and honest film i ll simply say i like it 
__label__1 and this somebody is me and not only me as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater why did the people love it it s obvious everybody knows zombies by now at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the dawn of the dead reinvention or resident evil movies etc or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies that is until this movie came along and you ll see zombies in a new light perhaps this is not a horror movie although it does contain some violent scenes but is rather a comedy a satire to be precise and it never runs out of steam that is why i rated it so high pacing wise it s incredible the acting is great and the script has no obvious mistakes quite the contrary it s a gem and if you re only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it and even if you dislike them watch it because it s a great comedy movie 
__label__1 set in world depression era prague this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague add a little twist the owner is convinced that his favorite employee stewart is having an affair with the owner s wife leaving stewart briefly fired along with an admission that the sales girl liked stewart all along the happy ending is inevitable although very dated references to poverty and i have a wife and two kids to consider are over used along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure like a musical cigar box are out of reach for common people s enjoyment this film is much more effective and more credible than the 1990s re make you ve got mail in the re make starring tom hanks and meg ryan the actual odds of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer s intelligence is grossly offended shop around the corner is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated less hectic and more romantic time and place known as a novelist s utopia lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture 
__label__0 i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing final fantasy the abyss etc framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless moreover there is nothing to watch the fx es look like there were taken from a second hand store you generally saw all of them in other movies but it is definitely a good lullaby :)
__label__0 i just watched this film 15 minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think it s a film about an internet s m star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she s murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wow michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he s in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i won t even explain the ending because quite frankly i can t make it out myself but before the final scene we re treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining 
__label__1 i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i don t love documentary i ve just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that s actually a movie came up this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny well that s about it cheers
__label__0 i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as the return of the texas chainsaw massacre but this film compete with it i m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie but i did it 15 minutes after the trance started i woke up and started to watching it agian why did i deserve that all the movie was a torture i have to use fast forward to watch it complete i can t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time mr walken could done this thing i have to think that he made the director a favor or he was really in the need of money because film after film he is doing he is ruining himself and so fast what about the movie it s not scary stupid plot characters are awful but i really liked the one played by jared harris effects are very poor lack of deaths blood etc in three words it has anything and i mean it can t stand how a director can make a film like this anyway when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover that the film was presented by stephen king i think he could never present this crap no i rented it in argentina i not recommend it in a million years i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 as i say in my return of the texas chainsaw massacre review there will be always a worse movies thats why it don t deserves a 1 out of 10 
__label__1 everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors that is to say that what might be number one priority for people like bush blair and company may not be so for a great many other people ordinary people from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened with the result the children are not impressed as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york usa wherever that is this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess whereas obviously the attack on the wtc was a dastardly event by any yardstick one does get the impression that both politicians and tv cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on lagos say or djakarta say or even on rio de janeiro say i rather think not news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen much more tv time is given to an earthquake in italy say than one ten times more destructive in outer mongolia say greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective or perhaps i should say some of the pieces do as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story his own translated perspective such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits but individually for each eleven minute segment in no way should one deduce that this is an anti american film that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments however it is not pro american either the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link if there is one is that the disaster of the wtc attack has to be seen in perspective from different view points only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been harbouring for two years now america has not learnt the lesson and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force instead of learning that the usa cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere its political leaders aided and abetted by blair and even aznar have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant which is not doing any good to anyone in afghanistan or irak at present let alone much elsewhere the white house mentality is totally rejectable the us and uk invaded irak and caused all the chaos and so should clear up the mess they caused not insist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil radical stances adopted by the us or even israel is only going to be met by radical stances from islamic people who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism if only to cover up their own macho uselessness i e stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground the world is in a terrible mess fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture 
__label__1 after being forced to sit through some real stinkers racing stripes shark boy and lava girl i truly enjoyed watching fried worms for once i did not guess the ending it was funny and entertaining and didn t resort to a ton of gross out humor despite the title my boys 6 and 10 both loved it too oh and my 45 year old boy had a smile on his face the whole time this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life he is not stopping singing just to annoy me also the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right on with the way kids behave of course the parents have to act a little goofy but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job have fun 
__label__0 granting the budget and time constraints of serial production batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor batman the producer sam katzman was known as king of the quickies and like his director spencer bennett seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement unfortunately this team also produced the two superman serials starring kirk alyn with their tacky flying animation canned music and dull supporting players the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles robin rescues batman batman vs wizard mechanical music droning on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks batman s cowl with its devil s horns and eagle s beak fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes his utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments in any case the lead players are miscast robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman he creates the impression that he d rather be somewhere anywhere else john duncan as robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue he is too old for the part with an even older stuntman filling in for him out of costume lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serial although serials were not known for character development the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast this one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support not one of the hoodlums stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever the wizard great name actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a shawl and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing the prime suspects an eccentric professor a radio broadcaster are simply annoying even the established comic book regulars are superfluous it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne despite the perils she faces vicki displays virtually no emotion commissioner gordon is none too bright unlike in the previous serial alfred the butler is a mere walk on whose most important line is mr wayne s residence they are props for a drawn out gimmick laden incoherent plot further saddled with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle class home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet pity that the filmmakers couldn t invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious batfan one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined now for the good news this is not the 1997 version 
__label__0 this movie was just terrible the first movie wasn t that great i mean it s ridiculously stupid if they didn t have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond i ll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink i don t understand was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn t be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film please no more of these movies 
__label__1 halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep it is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time michael myers is the best boogeyman ever he was just so terrifying what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the hell out of people 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in 78 it s about a boy michael myers he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution dr sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back since he describes michael as pure evil the blackest eyes the devil s eyes michael is on a mission though to kill his other sister laurie played by a new jamie lee curtis she has to babysit on halloween while her friends are out partying and of course we know the rules they get it but laurie may stand a chance since she s the virgin d halloween pays many homages to psycho we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis the daughter of janet leigh halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors bolt your windows and turn off the lights they re gonna get you they re gonna get you halloween the ultimate horror film 10 10;D
__label__0 i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote so i could find the info button to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voice over artist sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didn t appeal to the really good voice over talent out there so weak voice talent strong animation who was this film targeting gay adolescent ducks i don t get it is there really such a dearth of role models for young up and coming homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the title this movie i found hard to love just like an ugly duckling 
__label__1 obviously there wasn t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other great chinese films i first saw this when i was 14 years old i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything 
__label__1 i saw this film after watching capote and infamous it is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie the reporter is straight the protagonists are more beatniks than gay the film starts slowly but on reviewing it a second time we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer director brooks creates notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to be killed are linked cutter on the phone is matched cut to perry on the phone cutter washing his face is matched cut to perry washing his face only perry s looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in las vegas to empty chairs this failure fantasy matches the failure fantasy that perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in alaska only to find it perpetually empty dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don t know that that they re going to die we cut to the clutters perry talks his dream about a yellow bird taller than jesus who attacks the nuns who have persecuted them the nuns begged for mercy he tells us but the bird slaughtered them anyway the bird lifted perry to paradise strangely perry says that he has an aversion to nuns god and religion this echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom the director puts in all sorts of what ifs and only ifs nancy cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house she is holding a horse perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on nancy can t sleep over at her friends house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner the decision seals her fate perry talks of bogart in treasure of sierra madre but it is another bogart picture beat the devil which truman capote co wrote where a fictional treasure hunt is the mcguffin but dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing dick wants the hard cash the 10 000 he thinks is in the clutter s safe which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as perry s mexican treasure cut to herb clutter signing a 40 000 life insurance policy he s thinking about mortality at the moment ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours the insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them later in fact it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were remembered there was one witness the detective keeps telling dick later but was that witness the jail house friend dick perry truman capote or god the viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie fascinating film 
__label__0 thank you hollywood yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap shallow effect heavy and redundant remake the original planet of the apes was an intelligent and thought provoking movie with a very clear message it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting this movie on the other hand seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum character interaction and development are non existent and most of the time it s extremely hard to figure out what s going on instead we get a bunch of pointless action scenes some marginally funny one liners and some very hollow quasi intelligent conversations the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic the make up of the apes is magnificent and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too however this does not distract from the fact that planet of the apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie filled with paper thin characters stupid dialogue and a nearly non existent plot please hollywood stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters oh yeah the ending did not make any sense whatsoever out of stars mainly for the visuals
__label__1 my short comment for this flick is go pick it up chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller there is no way the character of miklos claiming and pushing for room in every way possible wont push your nerves to the edge 2 thumbs up 
__label__0 i m a horror gore movie freak and this flick was so bad i felt embarrassed for not only the actors but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock from the title you d expect some great carnage somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog instead you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode at least i laugh at the three stooges while watching this crap i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened needless to say i kept watching stern watching this film i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys 2 dv cameras 50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc this film is my inspiration to get into no budget film making watch this movie if you dare but be warned there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action this makes kazaam look like a meryl streep film i m sure germany didn t ban it due to sex or violence other countries need to take heed

__label__0 in this short an urban man and his wife have their weird lives set akimbo when the man takes to wearing an old red pants suit of his mother in law s i kept watching this hoping that i could see why it had been made or why the other reviewers found it funny for me it was a total waste of time not everyone s tastes are the same but this was clearly not to mine 
__label__0 journey to the center of the earth is the story of some tourists of hawaii three of them siblings and one of them a young british nanny babysitting a dog when the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits the nanny follows them it might ve just been safer to purchase more all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore i guess for some reason they actually go in the cave and then when the place starts caving in they try to get out to no avail except for the six year old sister who they tell to go get help meanwhile the more they move around in the cave the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core and behold it is here where they find the city of atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn t want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own i see that rusty lemorande the named director of the film has provided comments on this film in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to alien in l a well whatever it was it was an amazingly cheap movie that i would rank only slightly higher than city limits a 1988 sci fi film also made on a non existent budget because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the earth i also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times funny even if only in its subtleties for example the aliens asks the british girl if she s an alien and she explains that the ministry should be sending her work visa shortly or when the alien girl finds bryan and explains that he is in the city of altantis and he mistakes this for atlantic city new jersey little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable imagine how great the film could ve been though if they had 1 actually intended to make it and 2 actually had money to make it i do like how in the end no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help she d just be wandering around the hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano mind you 
__label__0 i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not quantity i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in along came polly stiller s reuben is grating charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year stiller s schtick is getting tiresome he undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break find some material that is actually funny because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad there s absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston which is a shame because she s a good smart actress with a promising career as long as she keeps making more movies such as the good girl in which she s terrific and less like along came polly she ll have a career of which she could be proud aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she s working but it s a daunting task for any actress with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin as reuben s boss stan and philip seymour hoffman as reuben s best friend sandy there s nothing funny in this awful film other supporting characters including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude are annoying azaria s accent is not only stupid it s terribly unfunny the premise of along came polly certainly showed promise unfortunately it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy instead of this lame dull boring excuse for a comedy 
__label__1 the movie atlantis the lost empire is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently parents who have had to sit through the jungle book 2 or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one the film is one of few to attempt at an original story previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories films such as toy story finding nemo and monsters inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film the quality of those films is given way to the profitability a new era started with atlantis following it were mulan lilo stitch and most recently open range the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years including that of young milo thatch voiced by michael j fox milo is employed by a museum in washington d c his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis this was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment she takes him to her employer a mr whitmore whitmore was a close friend of milo s grandfather and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis mr whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis not just the discovery of people it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images a feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two the characters are believably human there are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get the creativity of the writers really shines through the culture of atlantis is richly developed including an entire language the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources such as plato the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this way although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo s nautilus complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in leadership this is not a bad thing it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male cast one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ever a tradition that began with the first feature film snow white and carried on through to the lion king almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs this is great and all what would the seven dwarfs be without hi ho after the millionth time through it d almost be better without but this one spares the parent not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song i for one am grateful the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children

__label__1 the write wordwhat you see is what you get not really what madhur bhandarkar s brave and brilliant page 3 does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose lives read party habits we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain the page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate bhandarkar cleverly avoids that he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence and in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life like robert altman although i m not comparing bhandarkar to altman s genius bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive whether it is a page 3 wannabe nri the gate crashers the newly rich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character sketch even if their parts may be miniscule and therein lays the film s appeal konkona sen sharma plays madhavi sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for nation today initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy but bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral policing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone hence the movie is not only about madhavi but also equally about deepak suri boman irani madhavi s editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery anjali thapar soni razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution abhijeet rehan engineer a homosexual make up artist and madhavi s roommates pearl sandhya mridul the sassy airhostess and gayatri tara sharma an aspiring actress it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters and more in one story but full credit to nina arora and manoj tyagi for penning a tight screenplay the dialogues by sanjeev datta and bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances thankfully page 3 brims with actors and not stars konkona goes through her author backed role with effortless ease ditto boman sandhya mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it atul kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character at times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possible paedophilia homosexuality etc but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed ultimately bhandarkar s attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world these are the same people that indulged in new year s revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature s ferocity clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values page 3 is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema abhishek bandekarrating poor average good very good excellent29th january 2005
__label__1 an overblown melodrama typical of its period mid 1950s and appropriate matinée food rock hudson the hulk everyone always falls in love with plays his usual stereotype role but whereas in giant made the same year when his material and co stars taylor dean were above average in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy the self destructive brother and sister robert stack reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor and dorothy malone playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top end up the losers and hudson gets bacall who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going to paraphrase oscar wilde the good end happily and the bad unhappily that is the meaning of fiction however i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot like other films of the period homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms maybe the film could be remade stack s character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying todd haynes s far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows also directed by sirk perhaps haynes could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film

__label__1 this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950 s and 60 s but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as david s second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba hayward is at her best in this film her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here she is ever the seductress but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet as a child when i first saw the film massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like the robe and the greatest story ever told along with perhaps 100 other films too the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film henry king a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon holed himself into any one genre pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and david s own deep struggle with his faith in god the path tread in this film could have been very hokey but king keeps it real and interesting all the way plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god just as david himself is struggling with the same from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction david is not satisfied with nathan s answer to paraphrase that no one can understand the will of god this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms this is one of his best performances i don t see this movie on television much anymore but when i do i never fail to watch it i think it still holds up very well today 
__label__0 i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film it certainly was not besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable the one about the remote control didn t even make any sense to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch i m all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer i only watched it because of some good comments posted here they must have been planted by people with ties to the film you may fool people into watching this but you can t fool them into liking what they saw i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming sure it failed miserably but it tried i reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst do yourself a favor and skip this dribble i wish i had 
__label__1 fact stargate sg 1 is a cheesy sci fi tv series there s no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg 1 remains a cheesy sci fi tv series stargate sg 1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx aren t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn t going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either but and this is where i really think stargate sg 1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that s actually worse than a one hour tv episode in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg 1 special i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg 1 as yet another tacky sci fi show don t stick with it and you ll see what i m talking about 
__label__0 just once i d like to see a version of beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem yet again after watching this sci fi presentation i m disappointed i m not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in old english but i wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern english and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires the story is exciting enough why add plot elements that are non existent and ruin the story what s wrong with being faithful to the text grendel is immune to weapons of any kind why introduce some super crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer the fight with grendel was beowulf vs grendel that s it no one else took part in the battle the only way beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons the mistake made by all previous challengers yet in this version danes and geats fight the beast and beowulf hacks off grendel s arm with a sword again why couldn t they portray what really happened personally i think a one on one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting overall this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale why add in a pact with hrothgar and grendel s mother that includes sacrificial offering why create extra characters like finn that add nothing to the story there was no love story in the poem they couldn t even set the scenes in the appropriate locations a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake they fail to notice the metaphor that grendel s lair signifies it s supposed to be underground to represent hell why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on beowulf since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story if hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot then that would be a truly great movie 
__label__0 star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning this second instalment of the che films moves the story forward to the late 60s where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down without the flitting between time and places of the last film soderbergh s second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even duller experience and more pretentiously the score has been drowned out giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating there s just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up you can t fault soderbergh s ambition or del toro s drive in the lead role it s just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn 
__label__0 maybe you shouldn t compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but they ve been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and that s nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture you re wrong it s overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop i was so glad when round 86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared like krs one public enemy ultramagnetic mc s jungle brothers bizmarkie to name a few and i still don t like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn t work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes differ and that s alright but as far as i m concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can t rate it higher than a 4 out of ten

__label__0 despite or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters stereotypes are in and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not too subtle cinematic screed one gets the sense that john singleton was dabbling in post structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day and higher learning was the tendentious result the low point of the movie is the peace rally in which the symbols of the 1960s free love movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a take back the night rally with live stridently identity conscious musical acts in tow perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new vietnam ooh how adrienne rich of him and remy s firing into the crowd is a nice touch if you re into rich s sort of political posturing i wish i could give this movie negative stars i can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race class and gender to popular culture and declared man hating a viable and honorable political option where s camille paglia when you need her 
__label__0 why bother seeing this movie if you have great movies to see it is a total waste of time and money the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it everything in it is bad actors were bad script was really bad the story is stupid and the worst cgi ever the only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club one interesting thing that there is a characther that we wish that he dies because he is so stupid that we get enough of him i don t remember the name but was the boyfriend of the chosen one note if you want to see a good movie this movie isn t the right choice 0 stars out of 10
__label__1 henry fool surprised me i didn t expect it to entertain and amuse as well or as strongly as it did fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie however it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film at least as good as ginger snaps back if not better i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum s part is so small but i m happy he is a part of this short run he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim the son of fay and henry this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons i am pleased for example to discover that henry isn t really the loser he seems by the end of fool and to further discover that he is in fact a genius well that really is a lovely stroke of the pen i am hoping they do a third like the end of the trilogy it seems to be missing they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father to validate the awesome change in his mother and the sense of near genius he himself feels welling inside him assuming of course that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father it feels like it needs to be done i d buy it even with more action this is still not an action flick it is more drama and intrigue a mystery of sorts i ll watch it often it rates an 8 3 10 from the fiend 
__label__1 this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv but it is one of the best movies i ve seen the film and its actors won several awards it is gripping fascinating and it will absorb you completely the story of a chase for a killer in iron curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction but it s ostensibly a true story i highly recommend it 
__label__1 as winter approaches our state owned broadcaster the abc has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights this commenced with a twelve year old movie length version of emma last sunday more recent versions of three other novels persuasion northanger abbey and mansfield park are to come the curious thing about this production by a e television networks with script by the ever reliable andrew davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring gwyneth paltrow and clueless a modernized version starring alicia silverstone which transported the plot to beverly hills perhaps as a result even with kate beckinsale in the lead this production sank without trace as a general rule much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters an outstanding example is brideshead revisited which had 13 50 minute episodes back in 1982 you only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of pride and prejudice in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six part tv mini series it s not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones adapt wonderfully to film atonement is a recent example but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation this production is ok kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p p samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly sybil fawlty on speed bernard hepton as emma s feeble father was also excellent we saw the damp countryside the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the formalities of the times i d have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and compares well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come 
__label__1 though the plot elements to the eighth day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that jaco van dormal s first film had though not as good as toto the hero which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions daniel auteil from 2001 s flavorless the closet downplays his part afraid to overact rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic however i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character s growth don t walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from toto the hero because you will be disappointed however the film still serves as a decent if not flawed movie
__label__1 you re waiting to see if the remake is better or worse i rated the audie murphy movie a 3 i m a harsh grader the second lowest i ever gave audie the worst being battle at bloody beach if you re curious i give this movie a rating of 8 and i m a harsh grader it s the civil war story of renegade soldiers if you want to call them that against the north people like quantrell and the men who rode with these outlaws the original was a watery version very clean cut while still depicting the horror of what these men did actually movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences who can discern the story i would be more apt to rate the original r and this one with it s gruff nature a gp because the newer movie gives a very honest version a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version film makers since the early sixties have boasted about realism but few of them deliver instead they just give the drab scenery drab costumes and drab events but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters the weakness of the spaghetti era modern film makers have realized this mistake it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today this movie is an example it gives the realistic settings but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era it has a few lulls which makes a complete sit through a bit hard and it has some unexplained situations but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up and the characters are intriguing enough it begins a bit campy but really improves the main character is one we can identify and at least have some sympathy for the audie murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy and is too self righteous without motivation the character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti hero there is motivation and a method to his madness we never feel he is truly right but we can understand where he comes from there is plenty of action in the movie there is also some humor one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn t lie to him and he mulls that over this movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades this director and writer team got it right recommended complete success 
__label__1 this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cat s previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different era s in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o 
__label__1 for years we ve been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull hollywood retreads like saw 2 to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like dark remains we managed to catch a screening of this film at shriekfest 2005 the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category the acting and cinematography are top notch but it s the direction that makes this film worth the view the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares the editing and visual fx are also top notch and while many horror films don t manage to use music to their benefit the score for dark remains only adds to it s creepiness i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals but none have been near me so i can t wait to hear when it ll finally be coming out on dvd trust me even if you re sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you won t regret it 
__label__1 this film is moving without being sentimental meaningful without being pretentious it tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as the encroachments of technology and an advancing society make the family run business increasingly untenable the acting is wonderful though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors we should have long ago they play their characters with honesty and reverence these are flawed characters each with major weaknesses but with such utter humanity and kindness that it s impossible not to become engaged in the story we need more films like this we need more western filmmakers creating films such as this 
__label__0 this movie starts out very very slow but when the action finally gets started it s a little had to follow i couldn t understand why some of the events were taking place and a lot of events happened before they were explained making them sort of confusing the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood gore it has although most times the special effects are lacking blood looks like red kool aid skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks again the story has a sort of amateur feel to it like the writer didn t take a long time to perfect it i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script i honestly wish i hadn t watched it not because of the gore but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life if you like extremely gory movies this is for you if not stay away 
__label__0 the japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies they have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere the problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects this film released in france under the title les envahisseurs de l espace is no exception its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans it s extremely awkward and laughable but well quite enjoyable too after all we do like these creatures and these films after all don t we 
__label__1 i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy come on guys a film isn t and shouldn t be a biography nor a novel any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people including some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist 
__label__0 i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontë s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but i m very disappointed i never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had first of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if it s been written for a contemporary horror film and like another commentator i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors i ve seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant it s definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave a very good performance he s very cute and the best feature of the film spoilers tara fitzgerald s characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesn t seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way i just couldn t believe markham could have fell for her and i m not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such a virago besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby stephens i found just ok helen graham s brother not very good maybe it s difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the reader s imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when huntingdon s eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for a period drama i mean don t we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas 
__label__1 who doesn t have unresolved issues with parents and which parents don t have unresolved issues with each other i know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better i ve always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first scene especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person and peter falk s monologue about being a hard working sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interesting nicely done paul and peter 
__label__0 where to start this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the editing is the worst ever the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects with muddled talking in the background i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on and what was i supposed to hear exactly probably one of the worst scripts ever made i can t believe people actually put up some green for this film it makes me think i could take a crap in a box send it to producers and then have them finance a movie for me dolph was a usual dolph nothing else needs to be said the villains were bad the protagonists were bad and the movie was a stinker if you really want to know what not to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this 
__label__1 as someone who was born to a german mother and english father who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp i come from unique position one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww2 on the other this miniseries cannot delve into every single part of hitler s psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler s state of mind in this the series does quite well carlyle is very good as is o toole i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career what was going through goebbels goring and hess s mind it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships but i hope it will make people research the subject more it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power 
__label__1 despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didn t quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film that s mostly people talking with each other in various situations that s quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a 7 for me the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael o hara o hara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him o hara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk o hara into working for them despite his initial reservations it seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and o hara doesn t want to get involved shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says he s arthur s partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks o hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly o hara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far i m not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i haven t seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but i ve tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty i love f for fake vérités et mensonges 1974 for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale 1967 when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7 the same as my current score for the lady from shanghai welles performance and the dialogue he s written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me he s a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotone he tends to sound like he s reading his performance reminded me of what i ve seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he s inherently sublimely dramatic i m also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course she s gorgeous which doesn t hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me i never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn t seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and anders almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his sweaty face structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crime mystery film it s too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence the ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a 9 the final scenes are easily 10s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time it s well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can t make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the maze like caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course it s worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isn t exactly a terrible film in my view but it s dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution 
__label__0 why is this film so bad well if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason then this film is it the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst the gags are predictable but that isn t what makes it bad they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say corky romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the fbi to destroy any trace of the family s crime history however it isn t that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn t feel like any comic hijixn are there corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes chris kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb slap stick humor will ferrel kattan s snl partner seems to have made a full career out of it the only difference between kattan and ferrel is that ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke there is absolutely no diversity in kattan s routine it s hard to hear the same joke twice but for a whole movie that is just pure torture the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes the gay mafia brother the awkward guy sch tick and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it even with a cast that has some comedic talent chris penn peter falk the jokes that commence are tired there is no chemistry too this film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors no body seemed to care about it or even try sad thing is no body told chris kattan that 
__label__1 i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i m depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result persifina the laundry co worker of ruby s ashley judd is another her eyes and smile could make the hardest person s day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being alone ruby is alone quite often isn t the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie 
__label__1 this movie gets it right as a former usaf aviation cadet i can tell you this movie has it all the tedium of the application process the waiting for word the joy of acceptance the worry about making it through the course the sorrow of watching one s buddies perhaps the best of them wash out the anguish of paying the ultimate price the death of fllow student airmen the glory of graduation always the flying the flying the flying many are called but few are chosen we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do 
__label__1 a beautiful movie especially if you like horses wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau a story of courage compassion and loyalty that transcends generations the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters horse in his own training i will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it highly a good family nite movie although there are some violent scenes it was the nazi occupation of hungary the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady a hauntingly beautiful film 
__label__1 this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp this wimpy guy morgan jeremy northam is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies plans instead morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman played by lucy liu and pretty much being double crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent how will morgan get himself out of this can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster played by lucy liu and more importantly can morgan make it out alive wow what a nifty movie i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan s fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan s head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses he turns into a man actively fighting for his life the ending wow the ending is incredible the twist is so much fun it left me gasping and cheering like crazy good performances from all around especially from jeremy natham lucy liu and nigel bennett i highly recommend this film 
__label__0 remember the chain smoking channeler exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago this is her lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers the producers have been using phony word of mouth promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe if you believe in channeling reincarnation new age dreck and day old baloney this film is for you if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality look elsewhere the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn t a wacko so you ll give her a bunch of your money if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief then maybe you ll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent 
__label__1 what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters the major point is we believe in those characters and once they ve met each other we want them to stay together it s simple and really efficient the background story is less important why does the screenplay go on the side of a half developed thriller it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film jerkers like to make not too much ambition right sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy it goes quite as easy as in rear window an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film but with a less compelling context where i am amazed it s to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if we ve not missed a part before jacques audiard is not a new comer yet strange and weird 
__label__0 last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito s way carlito s way rise to power 2005 which went straight to dvd no wonder it completely and i mean completely s ks waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it i don t understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh t fest of a movie except for only one fact that i tip my hat to jay hernandez who plays the young brigante reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino too bad for him i don t think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh ty movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth 
__label__0 i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor like many others on here i don t know how to categorize this film it wasn t scary or spooky so can t be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it can t be a drama there was no suspense so it can t be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn t there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didn t 
__label__0 ok i caught this film halfway through but oh dear god it sounds like they re all reading from scripts especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting scripting and general plausibility it quite clearly appears to be a cash in on human traffic but whilst that is not the best film ever it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest yet hopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash 
__label__0 nicole eggert was listed as the star of this despite micheal dorn stacey keach being much bigger stars than her basically this is a bit of a spin on the alien lands on earth film eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise a bit of nudity and partial nudity a pointless sex scene all feature along the way the film stumbles through a few obvious set pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs i quite liked the star trek jokes when micheal dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene it was fairly obvious that stacey keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the alien passed to eggert 
__label__1 this gripping tale of intergenerational love jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast with a sharper picture and crisper sound my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times luckily even missing a word here and there won t spoil the fun the primary actors are ideally cast robson green brings an enigmatic smile a go for broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he s just begun to work francesca annis is one of the most striking 50 ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries as russell baker notes in his introduction you may not be morally improved by viewing reckless but you ll have plenty of fun the sequel a part of the dvd box set provides a wild yet satisfying two hour denouement you won t want to miss it if you ve enjoyed what came before 
__label__0 edward montagne s tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor instead it s a poorly acted witless look into low budget and uninspired film making the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish john miles who had a rather thin resume in the industry grins and guffaws throughout and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government made filmstrip about driver safety the movie anticipates shows like leave it to beaver and father knows best in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in 1950 why the viewer doesn t even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie the only thing the movie has going for it besides its brevity is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner the low budget of the film works in the cinematographer s favor as the viewer is treated to well framed shots of new york city s interiors and expansive exteriors unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles i suggest watching practically any other movie 
__label__1 at first i hadn t read the novel so far and i hadn t hear anything about the author yet but as i casually saw this movie i was totally captive by the story already as the jewish watchman primary said that he knows no one who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w campbell junior was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war terrific and the fictitious story about the most effective spy for the usa in wwii who have lost everything that was important for his life is wonderful emotional transcribed this is the best story about the duality of humanity i ve ever heard about the questions this movie is introducing are in my opinion very important for our society when does someone bear the guilt of something what is guilt who is a hero and who is a felon what is important in our life can you live without paying attention to the political changes is the protagonist guilty or not these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years this is a must see for everyone who have to think about the acception of war this movie is a must see for everyone who meditate what matters in life and what doesn t 
__label__0 and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right comedy is hard this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think it s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers come on i ve seen pauly shore movies that are 10 times funnier than the underground comedy movie here s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d kman the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen that s it that s the whole joke wow this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch there s a bag lady beauty contest in which we re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny it s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is truth for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags some of the sketches might ve sounded funny on paper but anybody who s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won t be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who s saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny they re regarded as stuck up squares i just saw white chicks recently that s another low brow politically incorrect comedy but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is it s not funny what the writers and directors don t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn t work there has to be more just think of the famous scene from there s something about mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list the joke about the semen wasn t just funny because it involved bodily fluids there was a buildup ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn t go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released a knock is on the door and he has to answer it his date mary is at the door and that s when it s revealed that the semen is hanging off ben s ear in this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever as jay leno always says this comedy thing s not so easy is it keep that in mind vince offer cause you weren t cut out for this genre the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip let s face it nowadays it s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is subjective but this movie shouldn t be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan s fame in movies like armageddon and the green mile there can t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or b movie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces but i don t think she s done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee nolin is nothing without baywatch angelyne is the film s biggest star keeping in mind duncan wasn t famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven t heard of her for good reason usually i m in support of extremely low budget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this doesn t become a cult classic shouldn t there be a law against distributing crap like this 
__label__0 the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director s express intention in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china however i found the combination of the glacially slow plot and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating particularly to a western audience at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart as they were filmed from such a distance two hours in and i was totally past caring as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema i couldn t engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into it begs the question if i disliked it who on earth would like it give me zhang yimou give me chen kaige give me the work of just about any other chinese director i ve ever seen this sorry effort just doesn t measure up at all i d be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark 
__label__1 1 this movie was amazing i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in overall i loved this movie one of jake gyllenhaal s best also my favorite parts were the science fair and all the times with his father they were so sad it seemed homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn t seem to care one way or another that tag line is true sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky 2 the way this movie was shot was impeccable it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950 s dress was accurate and they had their slang down too definitely recommend this movie 
__label__1 that kid a is such a babe this movie was no titan a e of which it is in many ways modeled after but still came off as entertaining the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wanna cry includes some of the most entertaining characters i ve seen in disney film
__label__0 this movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century pre wwii india where the british and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true indians are good surely such clichéd depictions of the british are rather passé now apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative the story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in all in all rather uninspiring oh and linus roache just cannot do tragedy going cross eyed with emotional pain just doesn t work for me 
__label__1 wow if you think that a film can t fatigue in some way then you haven t seen dog bite dog this film pulls no punches and it doesn t shy away from showing very disturbing images at all much like salo this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit it is gritty dark depressing and hopeless but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of hong kong the script is much more of the same but don t go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd it basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game against a professional and emotionless hit man while the script offers nothing new on the surface it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity is violence really that necessary do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child without pity without remorse in turn we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger this is a sad truth it is a topic that the director brilliantly explores without limiting himself at all besides the cat and mouse chase the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters one is about love and the other is about redemption even if the script isn t that new it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times the acting is really really good edison chen as the hit man is incredible he proves that he isn t just any pretty face he is ruthless vile and beyond likable sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding the supporting cast in short is excellent the music is also worth mentioning very somber score by ben cheung with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film the cinematography by yuen man is also really good overall this catiii film is highly recommended very well paced incredibly acted marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all however as many have pointed out this is not a movie for everyone if you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one if you don t like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isn t for you too in the end a powerhouse film 8 10 
__label__1 i saw this film at the taos film festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it it s a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed more than anything it reminded me of the films of david lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels the best movie i ve seen in years 
__label__0 return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn t play like a movie it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes return of the boogyman is just a clip show mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie over and over again the same footage how boring this is the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie i have seen the first movie i don t want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don t know who would the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it 
__label__0 zombie review 3 spoilers few films are actually so bad they re good and zombi 3 is not just bad it s wretchedly unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them allmore than that it s a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency sense or reason however we can t blame fulci as it wasn t really directed by him but by bruno mattei who doesn t even have fulci s sense of style to help carry the film mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude so i m ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3 it has no redeeming features in a genre known for thin characters weak story and lack of film making skill zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it s even funnier than nightmare city the action starts when the death 1 gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape who is the thief why did he steal it and why did the us military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3 after hiding out at a hotel the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it sending death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in zombie birds who then attack people and turn them into zombie people if zombies are cannibals why don t the zombie birds just attack other birds then we meet our heroes a trio of horny gis and a coachload of girls there s a couple of other guys with them too but they re not important no one is important here you ll be hard pressed to remember anyone s face let alone their name or find a reason to care about them they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was buzzing with life now it s buzzing with flies but there s no escape from the undead by this point you ll either be completely sucked in or you ll have turned the damned thing off the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldn t save it so it s just as well they have some of the worst and not just the human characters the zombie acting here is an all time low there s no consistancy in how the zombies behave some shamble about in the time honored style others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film it s horrifying twist ending they die from gunshots to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good left hook how can you punch out a zombie in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of v the zombies also spend a lot of time hiding seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life they hide in bushes in garages in huts on roofs in the water and even underneath pregnant women at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs to kill and eat her no to push her into the water those zombies and their wacky sense of humour there is plenty of gore though limbs are hacked wounds ooze green pus and there s much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in there s nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing but if bad make up effects are your bag you won t be let down all this and i ve not even mentioned the awful music the inexplicable flying zombie head the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad or the final chilling punchline in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj he s gone over to their side our escaping hero s cry before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came zombi 3 is rubbish it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it s existence erased yet somehow i feel my life is richer for having seen it did i say richer i meant 88 minutes shorter 
__label__0 it s so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows as superficial and brutal as the garcea series or the vacanta mare child plays the difference is that mugur mihäescu doru octavian dumitru and other such sub artisans never presume to claim their shows as art pintilie who 40 years ago made a very good movie duminicä la ora sase followed by another one nice enough reconstituirea tries to declare his film lenghts art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such niki ardelean offers again a sample of how not this being about its only merit 
__label__0 be warned this is crap that other crap won t even deign to be in company with because it s beneath them okay got that out of the way let me say something more substantive i ve seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director wong kar wai well despite of all of that wkw hasn t succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans mostly it is just shots of dripping water beads of sweats legs of horses running etc i couldn t sit through most of the movie fast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr wong s movies another shot after hearing many praises especially from cannes i was intrigued by his latest 2046 a friend told me to start w chungking express because it is his most accessible movies so wrong i was just p o that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah it s all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it but no he merely shows what is faye wong s acting is very typical of hong kong s style garbled enunciation deer in the headlight wide eye expression try to be cute and girlish kind of acting the rest of the cast is equally uninspired i think the word auteur is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different which is to be applauded but not one who hasn t yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling which is what mr wong is for the last 17 years 
__label__1 i gave this film 8 out of 10 reserving 10 for e g amadeus and 9 for slumdog millionaire most recently this film is close to slumdog but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding balkan life mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully to understand it you really need to be one of balkan this is an amazing movie much better and more contemporary of his previous films which are boring at this time i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie i like humour balkan humour photography is an art itself each scene is artistic to the limit plot is probably a fairy tale don t recall it now but remember reading to my daughter going to sleep a similar story 
__label__0 shlock merchant leo fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy barely coherent horror a wimpy orlando bloom type called ilias from some society vaguely resembling ancient greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress wackiness ensues the sorceress is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself she sends various minions each weirder than the last after our heroes who win through in the end striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere this movie contains a steady stream of wtf elements and moments for some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen this may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks either way it failed there is no atmosphere unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks the wolf man minions look like a poor man s wookie for some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion six million dollar man style toward our heroes when they attack there are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time the other minions of the topless sorceress other than the generic leather clad humans are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay hispanic lisping daleks the fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful oh yeah the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of doctor who would have been embarrassed to have used ilias our nominal hero is bland and forgettable he also looks a complete wuss especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair and is clearly a moron sure he s a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero mace when he meets ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies traipsing the misty hills together mace promises to take ilias with him in return for bow related favours ilias asks where he is going wherever my legs take me is his reply good enough for ilias mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite he proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean he says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals he is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason not long after they meet he is testing out ilias bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman minding his own business walking along and mace shoots him dead there is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even ilias who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society doesn t even raise an eyebrow the films villainess is quite unusual for the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head it s like fulci included her to make the movies obligatory t a quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute she spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like ilias wow such symbolism later on in the movie she wimps out when she can t beat ilias and mace and promises to make herself the sex slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her hardly the world s most scary villain and not really a step forward for women s rights i think he sic s the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates mace in a situation where there is no no one else around but mace to fool was he really worthy trading your self respect for ocron there are quite a few other wtf moments most of them come toward the end of the movie ilias wusses out i forget why possibly his permed hairdo got mussed but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid mace in fighting the forces of evil all of a sudden for no reason his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy the bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured mace the climax is also rather nonsensical mace decimates ocron s remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability he then is able to shoot ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity she starts dying her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous muppet head she staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog mace smiles roll credits strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused any one who has seen wizards of the lost kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be

__label__0 all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop many have spoken about it s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole as far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home about as others have said bad movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad you revel in that fact this film however is a void it s nothing furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way requiem for a dream trainspotting fear and loathing in las vegas and candy are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like go overall both serious and funny and halfbaked on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from lock stock and two smokling barrels to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by loaded is vile overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie 
__label__1 when i first heard about the title i thought of the simpsons just like so many other reviewers but when i saw the cast i was completely stunned that so many great character actors would actually be in this first of all we have christopher walken deer hunter pulp fiction who plays the title character mcbain he is rescued from a vietnam pow camp by some of his buddies one of which is santos chick vennera yanks who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently and tells him that he can re do the favor to him if he ever gets into trouble then 18 years later santos and his sister christina maria conchita alonso the running man predator 2 join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator el presidente victor argo taxi driver king of new york and when santos fails the mission christina goes to mcbain for help mcbain then asks his good ol vietnam buddies to help him first there s the token tough black guy eastland played by american ninja s steve james who was also in director james glickenhaus previous movie the exterminator where the exterminator s real name also was eastland coincidence i think not there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator among other things the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a welders mask when christina sees him for the first time when he is working on a welding job on top of a bridge the other guys in the vietnam pack are the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team frank bruce michael ironside total recall starship troopers and then there s the doc dalton played by jay patterson who doesn t look like the guy the imdb is linking to and i haven t seen him in other movies so who knows and last but not least there s the cop gill who has had enough of his unsatisfying job he s played by thomas g waites who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing and in other big roles we find luis guzmán boogie nights carlito s way as a small time drug dealer who can t get a decent job also there is dick boccelli as the drug dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain gang almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat grinder by john eastland in the exterminator movie now i haven t seen glickenhaus shakedown blue jean cop yet but i m almost ready to bet half a hundred dollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too well back to the plot of this movie they go off to colombia and saves the day yay but who cares about the plot anyway the cast is great and the action scenes are very well done and you re never bored while watching this movie highly recommended to all action lovers 
__label__0 this would ve been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i m doing really big acting sort of way everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedy mostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i couldn t tear my eyes away this dialogue might ve worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pace this script must ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera imdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isn t character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that s a plot contrivance stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you ll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male look at me i m the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory don t say you weren t warned 
__label__1 it s remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most over used story lines in cinema dog bite dog is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal only pou soi cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent relentless this is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies i ve ever seen with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell not even the installments in chan wook park s trilogy of vengeance with the exception of oldboy perhaps or any other infamous cat iii film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in dog bite dog pang is a young and ruthless cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of hong kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant when the police arrives at the place young officer wai sees how pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him the first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath as pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even wai s long time friend and colleague from then on begins a thrilling and action packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer the latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump what makes this routine action thriller so fascinating apart from the explicit violence are the main characters backgrounds pang the hit man is a cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight kill for money ever since he was a child he knows no restrictions has no mercy and barely speaks a word wai the cop became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role model father also a cop lies in a coma after a drug related incident lai doesn t question suspects and witnesses he yells at them and he s prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis people with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film because the cruelty and shocks featuring in dog bite dog can easily cause nausea it s not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically the filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying the performances are terrific i wouldn t be surprised if edison chen and sam lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate dog bite dog is a powerful and unforgettable film highly recommended if you can stomach it if you fear you can t just wait a few years for the inevitable american remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little

__label__1 atlantis the lost empire has some of the best smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i ve seen and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes i especially love don novello s voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate at least in the first act one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist which atlantis doesn t provide he s average at best halfway through the movie there s a mediocre twist that s all it s a great movie nevertheless everyone should check it out 
__label__0 it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone brian depalma al pacino and even michelle pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage it is nice to see people so rich and successful wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of film making of all time this movie represents the worst of hollywood what is this is it based on a true story well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today but then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a cuban refugee going to make it in the american drug subculture kind of like rocky on cocaine is it a movie about cuba or cubans for the life of me i don t believe there is a single cuban in this movie the accents are totally fake and scene with antonio s mother looks like a poster for midwest american values the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show is this movie about miami it looks more like l a transposed in florida afterall a palm tree is a palm tree is this a romance novel the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other is this a drug movie well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water admittedly the acting is terrible let s get to the rest the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence welk show i think i heard a polka the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective clearly the photography budget was excessive the sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse the writing is appalling this is one of those movies were the script writes itself you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks so i am going to ask is this even a movie it could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours but at least a drama series has some kind of focus maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap 
__label__0 whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration if in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afro americans in georgia such as shown in this film obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there it is rather hypocritical to say the least if everyone adores halle berry whoopie goldberg beyoncé noemi campbell denzel washington will smith et al whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides white grandmother suddenly gets black grand daughter thrust upon her only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater the story is sweet not lacking tragic overtones and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films though the final scene has you guessing will he won t he gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering and louis gossett is a good match for her the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the show a nice way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it 
__label__0 with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster cheaper by the dozen comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue shallow plot lines and cheesy comebacks with about two good actors among many wanna be s this movie was a major disappointment its a hollywood wannabe ditto of an already bad plot then because they needed a lot of actors that meant that they d probably be more lenient so the acting wasn t five star the plot moved fairly fast and the twists were bad and had horrible timing the junction of characters and the end relationships were also too mushy and clichéd for me spare yourself and rent something better 
__label__0  the house of the spirits is quite awful i live in south america in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid things are not so simple and linear as appears here and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in the house if you can t show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema without so many commonplaces in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public s intelligence 
__label__0 noting the cast i recently watched this movie on tcm hoping for an under appreciated gem as i regard many films from the 30 s this is no gem not even semi precious the anachronistic clothing and 1930 s rolls royce limo hit you immediately the casting is strange also but mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components aren t mixed according to the right recipe it simply doesn t come together like it should and that s a shame with a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good movie the film is about an american showgirl jean harlow seeking a rich british husband preferably from the nobility she meets franchot tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy s employer harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls and she sets her sights on him this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction however tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german 5th columnist on the eve of wwi and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart tone and harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a mata hari type benita hume and harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of tone s murder in fact tone recovers from the wounds harlow flees to france where she falls in love again this time with a wealthy french cad cary grant tone now in the army and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant s hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash in the following scene tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold digger harlow never explains about the witness accusing her of murder and her panic that is one of those unreal movie plot device break downs in the story then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman hume who shot him she is on hand to watch her paramour grant test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england incredibly both hume and tone dimly recognize each other but simply can t place where from okay so tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse this is inexplicable and unnecessary hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn t able to place her that would have been a much better treatment of that issue the finale also is very unsatisfying the movie as made has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero then harlow and tone just walk away it is noble to preserve the french public s perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love story what the film begs for is this harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant s reputation meanwhile harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is harlow rekindles feelings for him too at film s end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant s death after grant s hero s burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fade out that would have made a nice little movie for cary grant fans it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long suffering first husband reunited with harlow it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england while cary grant is cast as the frenchman this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been 
__label__1 ida lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system not surprisingly she also tackled proto feminist themes that when touched at all were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about in outrage she treats rape and its aftermath and though throughout the short movie it s referred to as criminal assault she leaves for once no doubt about what happened mala powers in her official debut plays a secretary bookkeeper at a big industrial plant she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy robert clarke who just got a raise and now makes 90 a week leaving the plant after working late one night she finds herself being stalked in the ensuing scene the best in the movie she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but fails when she returns home disheveled and in shock the police can t get much out of her she claims she never saw her attacker who manned a snack truck outside the factory trying to pretend that nothing happened she returns to her job but falls apart thinking that everybody is staring at her judging her she goes into a fugue state running away to los angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop waking up in a strange ranch house she learns that she s been rescued by tod andrews a young minister in a california agricultural town she lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges the two fall vaguely in love but it s clear to andrews that powers is keeping dire secrets when at a company picnic she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of jerry paris who was trying to steal a kiss the truth about her past comes out it was a courageous movie to come out in 1950 and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental ending up talky and didactic yes lupino had important information to impart but she didn t trust the narrative to speak for itself her cast pleasant but bland and generic weren t much help either reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance but outrage was a breakthrough blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is and what it really means to its victims 
__label__0 one of the worst movies i ever saw my only thought was how can i get my money back from hollywood video this is no way worth four dollars or any dollars i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican or vin diesel s movies but it failed miserably to do this the acting was terrible i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn t find something better to do with their time the story was ridiculous we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors it was so predictable the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated worse than a cartoon skip it 
__label__0 okay so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out that is actually not the case it s about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it s up to her mother to believe if she s telling the truth or not to be honest i really enjoyed the concept of this movie they had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love hate relationship between mother and daughter i did not however enjoyed watching lindsay lohan s acting in reality this movie would have been great if they had someone else perhaps a better actress the character of rachel lohan is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film i do however think that if you put lindsay aside you will enjoy this film the ending is pretty great and sad 
__label__1 spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup overall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice 7 10
__label__1 i don t know why some guys from us georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don t understand at all for those who did not watch this movie watch it don t expect too much or don t put some frameworks just because this is kosturica watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages gypsies in all balkans are always try to f ck you up in any way they can love is always unexpected pure and colorful and balkans are extremely creative for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the american s sh t like meet dave get smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside it is simple but true it is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead 
__label__1 up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long running series the varied action scenes and really different characters jabba the hut furry woodland creatures etc made this a particularly appealing movie none of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser duel between luke skywalker and darth vader another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in fighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page it was nice to see in the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else 
__label__0 i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for 5 on vhs she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch this movie however scared the hell out of me you may be asking yourself how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas that s right satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day for if santa doesn t make it back to his home in space he turns to powder don t get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy 
__label__0 i had to give this film a 1 because it s that bad but don t make this think that i didn t enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80 s style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warrior s swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and there s some crappy model effects those aren t supposed to be real trees are they and i still don t understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so don t let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons it s much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i don t think so rent it and you ll see yo 
__label__0 boy this movie had me fooled i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy i got the cold shoulder that time this movie was and i m truthful pretty damn good it was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch i almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent i enjoyed it the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas which made things more intriguing the pov camera angles were awesome the movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison he is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman he than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted him this movie had such bad acting with the exception of christopher allport that is was funny i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom they had a great story with a good plot but it wasn t executed right all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel 
__label__0 in short spike lee clearly has a lot on his mind he s thinking about racism color ism media and hegemony consumerism and capitalism religion sexism hetero sexism politics of the drug war etc etc that level of consciousness on is own is great i think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies however just because lee is making contentious films does not make him a good film maker what comes across in jungle fever is a superficial understanding of these socio political forces this is largely the result of two main failures firstly lee is simply trying too hard he seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every political social statement he can think of into the 90mins and as such the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present and so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs the end result is very staged and unrealistic secondly by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social political issues presented what comes across is a puddle of regurgitated non sense you feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages these are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker he is unable to distance himself from the work and allow it to speak for itself it functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument although i still do appreciate lee bringing up these important issues i must say two thumbs down 
__label__1 a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes don t be fooled by 2point4 children s cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and that s what s so good about the show it s not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller coaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile it s a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veoh com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops 
__label__1 why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn t been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also unmissable you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch cudos to the actors it s very believable and it doesn t stop there they have a final shock for you it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really endemol who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman s kidney to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation but are we getting too close for comfort 
__label__0 this film deals with two ex football players who are fred williamson mack derringer and gary busey lenny who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds mack derringer is approached by his ex wife vanity jennifer derringer who works at having sex talk over the telephone jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies mack lenny have more time on their hands and often go to miami fl golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city things go on there is lots of punches killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big zero don t waste your time this film cost me only 50 cents and that was too much 
__label__1 if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson complete with the lakers t shirt do not dismiss this film as trash 
__label__0 i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest worst attempts at one a lot of the scenes work in a plug and play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic comedy genre usually this is okay because we re dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive this movie fails to do so there is no sense of who the characters really are apart from sylvie moreau s who is the real star of this movie not isabelle blais they fit into this one dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative the pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary close ups i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious of course along with that you have the right on cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched i can t believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive if you expect a good light hearted romantic comedy this is not it or rather this a poor attempt at it you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicks les aimants is a good movie for what it is but it s a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur s 
__label__0 just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased i actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before ie hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff re hatched i read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my fault someone said it was good no more gory horror or reeling back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please don t bother with this movie get mary poppins now thats scary i m off out now go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this little miss sunshine maybe
__label__0 this was a classic case of something that should never have been gloria was now a single mother her husband had left her because she wouldn t live in some commune with him he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society right then and there i had problems with the series come on i say to myself is this the same noble michael stivic that countered archie bunker s right winged philosophies the series went on but it just didn t have any pizazz whatever momentum sally struthers gained from all the family was long gone maybe if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family it might have worked out ah well that s show business 
__label__0 i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good but i was wrong its bad but when i saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and i really didn t know how old the 2 girls was trying to be i was so confused the film was in some parts confusing and i didn t enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it didn t it was boring dull and did i say boring and i don t think many other people liked it as well as me boring boring boring
__label__0 when i had first heard of solar crisis then got a load of the cast i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before then i saw it now i know for a movie that encompasses outer space the sun vast deserts and sprawling metropolises this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won t have to pull too far back and the effects while good are pretty underwhelming we re talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare but other than shouting sweating and a red glow about everything there s no real feel of emergency don t get me started about the cast what heston palance matheson boyle et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone s guess makes you wonder who else s condos aren t paid for in hollywood and as far as the end goes well let s just say it s tense and intriguing but it s too little too late in an effort like this if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film maybe i would have heard of solar crisis sooner two stars mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this 
__label__0 great mystery but the film goes down hill from there the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer edward he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman they don t like outsiders a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl that made the movie too long it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward overall not a well written story and too long final verdict i would skip this 
__label__0 an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn t reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending 
__label__0 anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the 109 minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967 s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of 4roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr
__label__1 by no means a masterpiece and far from errol flynn s best istanbul still has much going for it the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography bring us back to a time long since past errol flynn does show moments of his past glory and is ok as jim brennan a pilot who s past comes back to haunt him the picture is actually a remake of 1947 s singapore and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche by today s standards also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply going through the motions in this picture many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats casablanca while watching the film i could see many of the similarities but hey casablanca has inspired countless imitators so take that for what it s worth in closing if you are a fan of flynn or old fashioned love stories you might want to give this film a look otherwise i d recommend casablanca or the maltese falcon as a good introduction to some of hollywood s classics 
__label__0 this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice over i think the voice over is too glib 
__label__1 i m watching the series again now that it s out on dvd yay it s striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired the central performances are gripping the scripts are layered i ll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that ll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035 i ve been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way well unlike imdb s submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everything in 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation when the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally i m starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it don t get more controversial than that 
__label__0 this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine moronic idiots the men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story i do not understand what they are there for they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks it s the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before every character here is a carping infantile stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt shudder is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian tracey is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted here as for the rest of the plot the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back yawn or karl who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock s masterpiece although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying by the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat 
__label__1 i heard a few friends one day saying that scarface sucks some idiot tried to make another godfather set in the early 80s now i usualy listen to idiots watch cnn so i decided i d stay away from it then my mate handed me the dvd and said this is 1 with the pelicangs confused i tried it this is the best film ever made it s more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford cough2fast2furiouscough there is some humor though i e the pelicangs and the light 80s music still whats better than al pacino wielding an m203 i give this a out of perfect for fans of al or gta vice city 
__label__0 rosie wasted a lot of tv time talking about the tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day puerto rican they were not the truth is that the africans and the spanish were and she knows it what kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick with an obvious black daddy cousins and auntie pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day puerto ricans but barely mentioned how africans influenced the way their spanish is spoken the food and music she is so typical and i lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does also since she wants to dance around her african ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness i e lackawanna blues we can find a prideful black latina next time thank you zoe saldana gina torres gina ravera and melissa desousa to the puerto rican on here that said they are african and not black thank you we blacks certainly do not have anything in common with you so there is no love lost but since you are probably in the states and have benefited from the civil rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood sweat and tears from the backs of the blacks you share nothing with if i am correct puerto ricans have a terrible image in the media but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations however you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior you are not also you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is bet again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood try visiting atlanta ga houston texas charlotte n c trust me none of those blacks want to claim your culture either 
__label__0 rich ditzy joan winfield a woefully miscast bette davis is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice jack carson looking lost her father eugene palette is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins james cagney seriously they crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in love this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why the script is just horrible there s not one genuine laugh in the entire movie the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus this is done three times only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated as it is they both do their best with the lousy material cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it doesn t work carson has this what the hell look on his face throughout the entire movie probably because his characters emotions change in seconds only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles but all in all this was dull and laughless a real chore to sit through this gets two stars only for cagney and davis acting and some beautiful cinematography but really it s not worth seeing cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why 
__label__1 there s nothing really to dislike about the odd couple and it s no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team but there s something so underdeveloped about neil simon s adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full bodied film i have not seen the play but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful since simon wrote it so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage to screen adaptation there are some interesting ideas in this story two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently that simon never fully fleshes out still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours 
__label__0 nope i am just not going to get with it here i refuse to go along with the program don t you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over rated look at the reader comments and their star ratings most are 6 10 7 10 or better i think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself which is unique how many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog dvd titles i watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation expecting fireworks and instead got someone popping a gucci shopping bag it looked great but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending didn t do much to save it the film s background story says it all director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie is informed the footage will not be appropriate sets it aside waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence that the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd original and shocking in a deliberate calculated manner goes without saying but we aren t here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone we must consider the entire film and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie or are they just enamored by it s background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it perhaps it is an anti clerical agenda that appeals to them hating the western religions of catholicism and christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance just today it was revealed that the bbc routinely skews their broadcasts with anti christian anti western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness you can say anything you want about the bible pedopheliac priests the institutionalized cruelty of the church and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball but say one negative thing about non westernized religions and you are toast this movie was tailor made for such a sentiment with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old french boys complete with inappropriate touching fawning fondling fumbling groping and patting of the backsides ewww and then there is the horse couplings photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry yes i understand the thematic relevance of the imagery large animal phallus s with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers but if i wanted to watch horses you know do it i would like go live on a farm having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants probably though i will grant the artistic execution of most of it filmed in a kind of arty euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a monet painting complete with a spanning arched bridge and the ending which even i managed to be surprised by does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package but you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it that isn t fair and even clint eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about iwo jima whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes the problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it oscars because of it s noble message not because it is a particularly good or original movie while it may seem like an odd parallel i see one with the beast how can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating and who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film s explosive set piece where beauty and the beast finally do the nasty somehow i managed to miss both points and am delighted that i have seen this film so that i can trash it as being what it really is 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy fartsy euro trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut and a great ending it s art for sure but it sucks hard 3 10
__label__0 this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen here are the things that immediately jump out at me 1 the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush not scary whatsoever news flash if you are filming in the southern california area big bear is only an hour away they actually have trees there 2 the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced every possible line in the movie was unoriginal cliché or just plain stupid for instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame what is a clown doing in a forest anyway was that the only mask they could find 3 the last but certainly the least was the acting absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph it s a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was not also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic oh and to the girl who played kat good lord stop singing that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself if for some reason you do see this movie i would at least recommend watching the special features the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending apparently she hangs out with special kids 
__label__1 disney and the wonderful folks at pixar of course offer a nice humourous story combined with the best of computer animation i admit that maybe the faces of the bugs were a little more static than in antz and they only had four legs in antz six but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking but let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists which i missed in antz some highlights were of course the bloopers at the end so keep watching at the end it s worth it which were highly amusing and original the line filmed entirely on location was intended for the more attentive viewer 
__label__1 just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered certainly fleshed out extensively and successfully by george romero but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it s a comedy and yes i actually think it is better than shawn of the dead thoroughly believable and perhaps even more importantly enjoyable performances by dylan baker carrie anne moss and young actor k sun ray whom i suspect we ll be seeing a lot more of in future features however i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr theopolis essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride or for those who ve seen the film wouldn t that read even better here as the corpse pride and of course scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character just think he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare s commitments to prison break as was revealed in the q a following thursday night s screening i can t help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead s zombie bub i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i won t start now suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and although and i did have to think back carefully to be sure there is a fair dose of blood letting and violence the delectable humour so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co screenwriters goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg 13 i urge you to go see this little canuck gem i ll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer 
__label__1 this is the fifth von trier film i have seen i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a 9 and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it although i d like to see it once more before i do he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors i tend to agree with him i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the pre eminent film artist from europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this about europa itself i ll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong i think that s the point this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydow s narration we are hypnotized or von trier is hypnotized and this is our his subconscious mind i m inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this although i am disputing that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd hopefully criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then i am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von trier s other films in the element of crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she didn t really say that did she so the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in our von trier s subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone what does the train itself symbolize consider it internally and only then discuss it externally europa is a great film a masterpiece i was never bored by it even though i watched it at 3 am the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic 
__label__0 i really really wanted to like julian po i think that slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read so i do not know if what i see as the film s faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the director screenwriter the premise is wonderful and i loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes but then nothing several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide one could argue that he doesn t answer because it s none of their business but julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public then neither julian nor the director writer despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god s sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian s life he says he was a bookkeeper he says his family moved around when he was a child due to his father s job so what there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian s purpose but none of them go anywhere because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them this might work as an allegory if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian i can only see the julian character as rendered as selfish petty and totally condescending sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half baked contrived film and poor michael parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here 
__label__0 wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs 45 secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn t deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money 
__label__1  spoilers spoilers released in 1956 and considered quite racy at the time douglas sirk s over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle who is insecure weak wounded very alcoholic played by robert stack in a very touching vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone ms malone s performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes which she uses to show us her emotions which mostly consist of lust for rock hudson and jealousy for lauren bacall malone is the only actress i ve ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first now don t get me wrong her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950 s but it is also terrible because as likeable and attractive as malone is she s not a very good actress and she s not capable of subtly or shading her performace is of one note she does get to do a wicked mambo and in a great montage as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses stack who should have won an oscar malone who won the award but shouldn t have are the real stars of the film the ones who set all the hysteria both sexual otherwise in motion while the real stars of the film hudson bacall fade to grey brown which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood best friend of stack s and the stalked love interest of malone s who moans groans over rock through most of the film but hudson wants no part of her and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack no one is very happy no one is happy for very long the stack bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and can t give bacall a baby to prove that he s a man sirk who was a very intelligent man and had a long fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950 s with a series of intense vividly colored women s movies or melodramas although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material in sirk s hands they became masterpieces of the genre sirk had a wonderful sense of color design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations lighting make believe shadows and lots of mirroed reflections in written the characters are always peeking out of windows listening at doors or sneaking around so in the end after much violence an accidental murder a miscarriage more sirk ends the movie with a final startling scene of a reborn and reformed malone in a man tailored suit sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell 
__label__0 this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can t seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life

__label__0 why oh why can t anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second adaptation of beowulf i ve been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version beowulf grendel starring gerald butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess what bugged me most was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason human sacrifices pointless love interest or the bad cgi or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film he was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didn t knock him out he was much too reliant on weapons beo wimp is more like it this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem i d like to end this on a positive note but i can t really think of one offhand all i can say is if you ve ever read beowulf you ll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation 
__label__0 this movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about santa claus and his magical and mystical wonders but instead it comes off as being downright creepy two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 the way santa looks have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus and 2 the evil rep of satan pitch s just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh i can t believe this is a children s movie 
__label__1 this is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective as a dvd movie it is perfect your hear every speaker working almost all the time the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good they give a depth to the driving scenes 
__label__0 this movie is great mind you but only in the way it tells a very bad story stella is so terribly crude and never learns better her husband is incredibly snobby and small minded neither ever learns better is this realistic somehow stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners dress yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down i don t think so stella is a good woman and a very good mother giving up herself so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting much of what we see might have been normal for the times people having a beer or two enjoying a player piano dancing but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority i can t have our child living this way spare me this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes and that is simply a load of hogwash 
__label__1 there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written seminal tv show the godfather to x files and buffy etc as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid or as a well written acted gumshoe film noir it works on both levels the scariness may have been diluted over the years it was made in the mid 70s but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak an eccentric tenacious rumpled newsman monster hunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of kolchak s over stressed put upon boss tony vincenzo played with tremendous world weariness by the also late great simon oakland you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like star trek s spock and mccoy only more acidic over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one season series kolchack fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies government conspiracies aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire 9 yr run of the x files in one season and kolchak did it first and as for composer gil melle s cool partly whistled main title music well x files creator chris carter calls mike snow s very similar x files main title theme an homage both themes work well leave it at that and unlike many modern horror sci fi shows most of kolchak s monsters are shown in shadow and in quick cuts effectively and sometimes thankfully as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny but some still do modern horror shows take note less is more one of the few flaws of the show and it s a small one is the over use of sunny california locales passing for windy city chicago night gallery had the same issue unavoidable for a modest budget l a based show and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are now viewed as clichés the effeminate reporter ron updike always used for comic relief sweet old lady advice columnist emily but they all do have their moments to shine unlike many supporting tv characters since cliché or not kolchak is a timeless show that serves as a template for many that followed and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show agent mulder s real dad and as a footnote i tried watching a few episodes of the new re imagining of the show it s an x files clone a copy of a copy and a bad one at that carl kolchak is now a model pretty angsty 30 something played dismally by a boring stuart townsend and giving him a scully type partner is also a lame idea it undermines kolchak as a lone don quixote crusader and kolchak and vincenzo getting along where s the tension the interplay that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake take a beloved cult series scrape off everything unique about it drain it of all character and color but keep the name need that cult cred and voilà instant re hash it gets an f in re imaginings 101 this new version deserved the axe stick with the short lived but classic original it truly gets better with age 
__label__0 this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didn t even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy tween disney movie crush story between meg and calvin it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book i can t believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if you ve ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings equivalence this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time poorly done 
__label__0 i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to character s behaviors today s kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events that s precisely what happened with movies like e t and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously don t waste your time money on this one 
__label__0 normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the public s perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried incompetent attempt at a money grab piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sam s club for 8 bucks i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes now as per imdb s policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot seriously it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camera work spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer however the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks aren t two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie in a particularly grueling scene the main character is shown looking at a pod then he is shown pacing and panting then he looks at the pod then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod i apologize for the extreme run on sentence but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere the editing is mind bogglingly bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a farmer s house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer stutters and paces around when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs 
__label__0 if this guy can make a movie then i sure as hell can make one too in fact if you hire me to make a movie for you i promise to do the following 1 i will add more naked women this movie had none i think cheesy b class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body i wouldn t want to let my viewers down 2 i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it s only a dream i think horrorvision had about 4 of these scenes and considering the movie was only like an hour long the dream to movie length ratio was quite high and if i do decide to do a dream sequence i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on i mean who sleeps in leather pants 3 i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine 4 and finally i will not mix modern technology with the undead i mean a palm pilot can only be so scary at least they turned it into an evil rolly polly monster before the screen blew up or something so if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production count on me wanna b movie director extraordinaire 
__label__1 we saw the silent version of this film and it is quite simply shimmeringly beautiful it s quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created since it is shot with pure silent technique long wordless sweeps of narrative without a single intertitle save for a few disconcerting sequences where louise brooks playing a french typist is quite visibly speaking in english the only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene where brooks is watching the rushes for her test for a sound film footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds with her mouth moving in ceaseless soundless song i was unsurprised to learn afterwards that this passage alone in the talkie version had been hailed as an exemplar of new technique in the sunny beauty of its opening scenes and the fairy tale inevitability of what follows the film resembles a dream as a louise brooks movie it was not at all what i was expecting either from her hollywood comedies or from g w pabst s german melodramas i found the idiom more fluent and enjoyable than either and brooks herself is a different creature a sturdy laughing young animal rather than a shop window vamp or manipulated doll but what gives this film greater depth than at first appears is the unexpected second half repelled by the rich parasites who cluster around her beauty the pauper princess returns to a tear stained reunion with her humbly born true love and the tale might very well have been ended there fairy tale however turns to tragedy the dilettante grabovsky confident in his ability to manipulate the woman he desires is yet all too correct in his self interested prediction the young lovers cannot make each other happy and andré ironically was right to mistrust the social influence of beauty contests after the intoxication of her moment s glory lucienne frets herself to despair over the humdrum routine of married life while her husband in turn is driven wild by any reminder of the whole affair if it were a simple case of a mis matched marriage that would be one thing but the true tragedy is that they do love each other in many ways prix de beauté reminds me of murnau s sunrise but if so the fairground and photographer scenes here would form a distorted mirror image of the joyous reconciliation in sunrise no dream but an alienating nightmare and the following dawn brings not a miraculous reunion but an empty bed and deserted home leaving a letter to say that she loves him and will always love him lucienne vanishes again from andré s life in quest of brightness and freedom and this time she will never come back gossip columns confirm all andré s worst convictions as he learns of his wife s whereabouts through reports coupling her name with grabovsky when the young workman penetrates at last to the lavish sanctum of the screening room it is with drawn gun to be greeted by the sight of his rival courting and caressing a laughing lucienne the same woman who had pledged her undying affection as she left him he kills her but even as he kills is transfixed by the living image on screen lucienne in all her transformed glory as he never saw her the two women are juxtaposed in an endless powerful moment as andré is seen seized unresisting and pulled away the dying girl and her singing self still projected above caught unknowing out of time into celluloid eternity playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath her the main jarring element in the film is the character of andré s co worker antonin who appears to serve no role throughout other than to be the licensed butt of his contemporaries malice he is the ugly one who can never get the girl the ungainly wimp who is tripped and tormented in the washrooms and at work and must take it all with an uncertain ingratiating smile in his fruitless hope for social acceptance a typical product of the bullying of the more gifted and popular in other words but one the audience is apparently being invited to laugh at along with his tormentors unless the intention is to expose a darker side to the protagonists for which i perceive no sign the character seems to exist merely as comic relief but comic relief with a distinctly nasty edge when we know him only as an inept peeping tom at the waterside it s easy to laugh although the others revenge seems a little over the top when we discover that he is no chance met stranger but andré s colleague and regular sidekick the continuing attacks rapidly cease to be very funny but it is the images that remain beauty nightmare and dream 
__label__0 this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for starters the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and cafes it really doesn t stay focused on the new york magic another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie i know that it is a remake but it is not a french style remake anyway here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies such as long and messy scenes no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style the story follows many lives too many for my taste and they somehow seem connected in the end i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone s happy ending so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each and there you have your 120 minutes if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast 
__label__1 secret sunshine marks the return of director lee changdong to the film making world after a multi year absence having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt he recruits now veteran thespian jeon doyeon and her considerable cannes winning talents for the primary role of lee shinae what follows is a journey through one woman s tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms one of the things that becomes apparent while watching secret sunshine is that it doesn t really care to follow any specific genre but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it s trying to convey the story itself follows lee shinae as she moves with her son to the city of milyang whose sino corean translates to secret sunshine she moves to milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown so the film is born from tragedy and you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice guy mechanic jongchan played by song kangho but this isn t a romantic comedy as we and jongchan doggedly follow shinae as she encounters milyang and the fate that it has in store for her the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent she is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it s not enough secret sunshine still manages to follow a mostly aristotelian dramatic arc but pulls back on the catharsis which might confound some viewers especially the ending but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of milyang the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied once i started to think over the film some more ms jeon is rather impressive throughout especially considering that if the role were any less well played it would ve quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama but she captures the nuances of shinae s attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety mr song has a much smaller role in this film than other films but he performs adequately appropriately giving stage to ms jeon technically the film is well done in a classical sense no flashy aesthetics are employed here the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself i think my only real complaint and one that might not be able to be fixed is that despite all the time we spend with shinae there is a bit of distance between shinae and the audience or at least me i think some of this stems from the nature of the work because if total empathy were pushed then we wouldn t be able to see the problems that shinae has objectively on the other hand i never felt moved along with shinae s plight despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior all the same the film still stands quite impressive especially in that it stimulated me to think about it the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy coping self deception isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running propelled by a strong lead performance i honestly didn t notice its 2 25 hour runtime and that says something well done 8 10 
__label__0 i was going to say this was the worst gay themed film i ve ever seen but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre i ve ever seen you know you re in trouble when a movie starts with a personal note from the director asking for the audience s understanding for the many challenges facing a first time director the audio track is so bad in many scenes it s almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a dvd version bad lighting bad sets bad photography poor script generally bad acting all add up to make this film unwatchable i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased i m sure there are many challenges facing a first time director but don t try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale but also the only that s the one positive thing i can say about this alleged movie 
__label__1 i don t understand the low 5 7 rating on this film it s a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil down to the locale savannah the acting is strong and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branagh s southern accent famke jansen is great robert duval is effective in a small part and embeth davitz is the bomb great full nude scene of her too the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed 
__label__0 jason lee s pecks are back if that s what you are looking for look no further if not better move on but about the movie clichés galore some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes used jkd and lots of bad acting cheap effects poor lee looks like he s in pain throughout the movie and no wonder not a pleasant comeback the movie doesn t even cut it as a b movie sure there was a germanish bleached blonde rutger wannabe bad guy but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots none zip nada even in starship troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence please refer to our upcoming review on that mind blowing sequel i did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this thus i won t get into the plot of the movie or pretty much anything else related except that it did have some non heterosexual overtones so nuff said however this movie has one thing going for it no jean claude :)
__label__0 this film is really bad with a script full of memorable lines and incredibly bad performances the special effects are also bad not the worst ones i have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it just two short themes 30 seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole film all in all one of the worst films i have ever seen 
__label__1 i enjoyed the story by itself but the things that i learned about wwi planes boats make this movie a must see the close ups on the plane the torpedo boat how they were used were completely new to me i heartily recommend 
__label__0 the return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time sarah michelle gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie i was willing to put up with this however i was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young or maybe i m wrong and that was just a flashback with this movie it s impossible to tell can you believe the same dude who made army of darkness produced this crap a much better idea is to stay at home and watch army of darkness on sci fi channel that movie had it all sluts zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm the forgotten didn t even have one of these things 
__label__1 of life in some colleges of course there were artistic licenses taken but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own it s funny because these are schools that want racial unity equality etc and i can honestly say that it s there but the thing is when class lets out or when they re just hanging out waiting for class they students seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity is that bad not really everyone needs a feeling of belonging but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them otherwise you re creating your own segregation racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations fortunately nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen so is higher learning overly dramatic exaggerated maybe is it way off mark it depends on where you went to or go to school the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen minus the hollywood exaggerations the race thing hit pretty close to home for me 
__label__1  the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that s really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs it doesn t have any cheesy moments and the love story isn t a waste of time the production designs are just stunning in this movie from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today s cinema the music and songs are also well done anyone who sees it will no doubt hail i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies i m usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i ll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don t see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like two towers and silent hill way before today s modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place one of my favorite shots in two towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and that s what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie they re just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they re all just fantasy beings it s literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of aladdin got their inspiration the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet it s not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it s nice to know that i m not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it s amazing that s a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40 s so give it a break not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today s standard if you ever wanted to see a live action version of aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won t be their cup of tea 
__label__0 hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this although i think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which i have mentioned blows this was made in the mid 80 s and is horrible in the music score department it s funny to see oprah as a latter day crack whore type the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator pure classic cinema first off i don t care how drunk you are you will react to 1200f degree flame no matter how bad your acting but they really milked that scene it was comical i ll tell you what though i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death she annoys me 
__label__1 there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar s mystical play farrell looks good in his title role but his line readings frankly stink this also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phony there are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are perfect rose hobart as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose hobart in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her credit melford s stylish visual direction of the original her great beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earth bound sections of this movie however one of borzage s themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to the hot place h b warner s performance here is as always perfect so we have here a flawed but very interesting version i think that lang s 1934 version is better as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel the watered down musical remake but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance 
__label__1  capital city fans rejoice this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i ve recently got my copy although very much an ensemble piece of key maverick trading floor characters capital city does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line the cultural mix english irish american german polish of head trader wendy foley s played by joanna phillips lane group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and to most people seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf richard le parmentier and james farrell denys hawthorne i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy s team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive free spirit peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy relaxed modern way of business become a reality to a certain degree wendy s i am led to believe immediate supervisor leonard ansen john bowe follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the middle ground on most occasions the main interest in the series i believe stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge s declan and the cool self assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann played by trevyn mcdowell which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship fondness that they undoubted have looking forward to browsing through this title and hopefully the second season of thirteen won t be too far away 
__label__1 considering a star is born had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble a viewer could be forgiven for believing that kris kristofferson barbara streisand were a couple off screen as well as on with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another the film has been described in the past as a barbara streisand concert on film set to a soap opera storyline however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive a star is born is well worth the hiring price with its incredible soundtrack flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life a star is born is a film that draws you into the world of esther hoffman the love of her life john norman howard a film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart 
__label__0 understand i m reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus neutering it completely when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasn t going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean it s easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up cannibals and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive s wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in fangoria i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way you ll make it through this movie 
__label__0 i thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970 but return played like a typical sequel everything about it budget script plot casting and acting was inferior to the original gale sondergaard as elk woman an elder of the yellow hand tribe looks nothing like an indian and neither do half of the other indians who were played by italians mexicans and latinos with cheap wigs and the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors he even used the bow like a woman finally richard harris who did such a superb job in the original seems to be coasting this time around i guess he couldn t resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as horse to be fair there are some interesting moments in the movie such as horse s undergoing a painful purification ritual to find his vision and rally the yellow hands against their indian enemies and white oppressors but on the whole return is uneven boring corny and predictable just like most sequels 
__label__1 this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and there s much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local boys done good overcoming adversity genre of which this parodies don t let anyone tell you that they re trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities sure there s plenty of that but it s all contextual not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me 2 99 on dvd so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film i ve seen this year 
__label__0 did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie 
__label__0 except people apparently buy into this garbage as shows like moral orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over the top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldn t come close to the hilarity of this show it s hard to tell what s even going on when you re watching it is it a news show a talk show who knows they start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy pat robertson doesn t even seem like such a bad guy at first glance he just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs like most of our grandparents but this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but two murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has supported forced abortions in china and who regularly implies that caucasians straight american male caucasians in particular are superior to all other races still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later either that or enough money to bribe some tv executives who don t give a damn what they show the idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word even when robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him i don t know if it s funny or scary i guess a healthy mixture of both 
__label__0 this flick reminded me of those lame erotic thrillers i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was 13 i d label this flick softer core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder there is however a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club we see kane hodder s keester or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster s for a costume 13 year old boys rejoice other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i ve seen in years the shots look like fmv s from the video game resident evil in terms of quality the wolf is too bad to be explained and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way way too many times the plot and acting make no sense there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do look human change to a wolf an kill people the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can t find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches once more this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched met or even saw as best i can tell the mate doesn t know she s a werewolf and she s fighting the transformation or something you d think it d be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but well they did want quality low end werewolf ism go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t a this is your flick 
__label__1 the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film and also relates to the dogma films did you ever get bored of those hollywood style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of fed up with the married living single cop the divorced but family man the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ever wondered how the real police work is like well for germany this film shows you set in the north between west germany and east germany former ddr an laid off post office clerk starts her job fresh from policeschool she quickly finds her way around the usual customers and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman but this is not much fun other german crime films like derrick der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view even more if you know that part of germany a bit 
__label__0 it s hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was transcendant trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent it s a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they re mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li sheds his new life to save the world the version i saw was dubbed and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer thin plot and comic book 25 cent special effects but i suspect even ninja turtle watching 8 year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow 
__label__0 now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land how did the di erector get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché but somehow cute or is that cliché piled upon cliché no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sant s gerry and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn t get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the unrequited love s a bore theme left over from a faded streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re filmed half of it got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey presto comedy tonight a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform i can understand why 
__label__0 herculis puaro is in general a well established hero we know well from books and movies this movie or this story don t work and i felt its not agatha s mistake the cast isn t good the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45 woman in the iraqi desert the victim is not likable 
__label__1 musings pure delight from beginning to end not a laugh riot but a more subtle sophisticated humor what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors including reginald denny nestor paiva ian wolfe harry shannon and jason robards sr cary grant is at the building sight of his new home which is at that point being framed a young carpenter played by future tarzan lex barker asks him if he wants his lallies to be rabbeted or some such thing that only a carpenter would know grant not wanting to appear ignorant replies in the affirmative at that barker yells up to his mates ok boys he wants em rabbeted so yank em out a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards all grant can do is moan yes the movie is dated you d never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home and a place like that in connecticut of all places would probably run a few million bucks a classic movie that is really a treasure 
__label__0 as a dane i m proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years it s a terrible shame however that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters i know it s wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings i particularly enjoyed de frigjorte 1993 as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working class slob who s down on his luck partly because he s a slob but mostly because of society and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community this is problem number one in villa paranoia clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is symptomatic of the whole movie there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldn t allow him to act out his feelings and later on voice over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an afterthought to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director s ineptitude fortunately at this point you re roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so called story the acting which has frequently been a problem in clausen s movies can be summed up in one sad statement søren westerberg bentsen whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast i give this a 2 out of 10 rating 
__label__0 i didn t expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out still i held out hope it sounded a bit much like bride and prejudice l a guy falls for an indian beauty parental conflict blah blah blah b p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters my bollywood bride had none of that the acting seemed stilted and way to by the numbers characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student technically the sound really bothered me it seemed as if there was a lot of over dubbing of dialogue i mean a lot i know sometimes it s necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting two stars is being somewhat generous 
__label__0 don t get me wrong i m a huge fan of many of woody s movies obviously his late 70 s masterpieces annie hall interiors manhattan and most of his late 80 s early 90 s dramas hannah crimes and misdemeaners husbands and wives in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts melinda anything else small time crooks but this was abysmal i though it couldn t possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i was it was lazily plotted basically a cross between match point manhattan murder mystery and small time crooks with all the jokes taken out woody seems to be on the way out as well slurring most of his lines and delivering hilarious catchphrases i mean that with all due respect over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare i know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it it wouldn t be so tragic if we didn t have so many great woody films to compare this to but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke embarrassingly bad
__label__0 well i had to be generous and give this a 2 this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that lady s shirt where her breasts are i found that mildly amusing other than that this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend funny if you re willing to throw mystery science theatre comments at it with someone but it ain t no better than a 2 and a 2 pretty much sucks 
__label__0 oh boy where do i go with this one herendous acting weak plot stupid deaths pointless nudity this isn t entertainment this is hell hell don t waste your money time or life on this pit of evil it s just god damn is this movie awful tom savini why why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it i d rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch this this sinful act again please take my advice and stay the f k away from this elephant turd of a film no you know what i shouldn t even have to call this thing a film just stay away 
__label__0 i tried twice to get through this film succeeding the first time and it was like pulling teeth and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer the problem it s simply too boring if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene which takes up most of the second half of the film you have it made but it s tough getting to that point there are some interesting talks by abraham lincoln henry fonda during the trial the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen it s a nice story well acted and such but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film 
__label__1 billed as the story of steve biko played excellently by denzel washington as you d expect this was actually more the story of donald woods played by kevin kline this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the role attenborough gave this the sort of direction you d expect and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past 
__label__0 well when the cameo appearance of jason miller looking even more eroded than he did in exorcist iv is the high point of a picture what ve you got it s a little bit country a little bit rock n roll mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog dried mummy have you figured that one out yet dried in a bog in the basement christopher walken with a bad dye job and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they d developed her i understand sort of that they re going back to visit her relatives after that problem there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing i think this is never connected to anything problem what do we need the grandmother for now the grandmother could be interesting she speaks gaelic or celtic or something maybe you can make something of her the best they can do is that she s got a tobacco habit that s all problem they cast a real shifty character as the husband is he type cast will he sell his wife to the devil maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her or is he cast against type after all he has a good haircut and nice clothes he drinks he hesitates he s not a bad guy not a good one but dislikable why didn t they do something with him no problem an old boyfriend shows up the husband knocks him down he comes back to knock down the husband it gets pretty stupid but at least that character has motivation now she s an alcoholic he s an alcoholic he might only have married her for her money the grandmother is locked in the bedroom the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch are you following this who may come to life in fact you know she ll come to life the music swells a little girl lives in the house takes tea to the grandmother unlocks the door to do so and provides granny with cigarettes periodically granny gets out but nothing happens husband and wife lose the kid in the house subsequently lose their bedroom uncle gets his throat cut in the basement the leading lady has nose bleeds the husband drinks they both drink in the face of all of this the awful truth alluded to in the first over voice is omigod an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old in spite of all these dangling thread ingredients nobody managed to get a story on the screen no bridge between situations no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror just long slow scenes that go nowhere nbody really to care about and they had places to go with that aspect the innocent kid in the charge of drunks the grandmother who might be locked up because she s a monster but no her worst fault is smoking she s got great hair good makeup in short no plot just a little random predictable violence in a dark library with the rain gushing in and the sound track cuing us in you need more than a few drunks and christopher walken to make a movie the production values were good oh nice scenery good wardrobe the cameraman at least knew what he was doing i bought it poor me 
__label__0 let me be clear i ve used imdb for years but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating i ve seen hundreds of films some of them bad a few awful never though have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence of high intentions and failure mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess but entirely unbelievable as phocion a young boy fiona shaw is always an entertaining character but the dialogue in the film is much worse even than in the insipid french play that is the source marivaux never reached hollywood until now and we should keep it that way to illustrate for example that leontine is a brilliant passionate philosopher and scientist she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker shouting out names of famous scientists and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier for this the pair should receive a joint clair danes award which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990 s see miss danes in les miserables aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming for example there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action sitting in chairs watching the principal characters the director wants us to realize she s adapted a play i get it but it doesn t happen at all until far into the film at that point seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment then disappearing is creepy and distracting they re like some sort of un scary zombie crowd appearing through the mists filling us with dread when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie you ll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes matthew mcguire
__label__0 i bought a set of 4 dvds for 10 bucks at my local suncoast which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel witchcraft xi so basically i paid the rock bottom price of 2 50 for this movie if you do the math i can t exactly say i was ripped off i have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name the budget couldn t be over 1 000 though it appears as if they spent a total of 1 50 i know it s a low budget film but that s no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork the film blood cult though not very good was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting the acting in this movie is the definition of effortless especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page you can take that figuratively or literally i wouldn t be surprised if the script was off camera as they were performing i said before that i ve never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones and though english movies aren t always good they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication which is why i don t see why any englishman or englishwoman would volunteer to do a home video style schlock flick like this did merchant ivory put a hold on their casting calls usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing acting and cinematography departments even when you watch a movie like glitter you can t honestly say it looks like a third grader shot those scenes though a third grader could ve written the script i ve seen home movies that are shot better than witchcraft x and that s no exaggeration whatsoever even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city not a single effort was put into making this movie let s just sum it up like that you get the picture there s a good deal of nudity though that doesn t save it however i must say that girl with the red orange hair who s either naked or wearing a cleavage popping outfit throughout the film is really hot my score 1 out of 10 
__label__0 i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie its kinda of a mini porno it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there s spots in the movie for and there s even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 i want be watching it again at all the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie 
__label__1 bedknobs broomsticks is another one of disney s masterpieces it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations a similar concept was used in mary poppins when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art i am mainly rating this film through child s eyes because i have not seen it in years back then it was one of my favourite films it was magical and mystical and the last scenes the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle were my favourites there was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells ie people turning into rabbits which may be a little dated and silly now also i believe that the film starts off slowly through the eyes of a child this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely forgotten today 
__label__0 for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the 1980s this isn t it nor is it a historical drama rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to sinclair s idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus lincoln superman and nelson mandela on the other hand there are a few laugh out loud moments as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt you know like jesus would have done if he hadn t been such a wimp true i saw only the 98 minute version but i can t imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better and what kind of a name is mungo 
__label__0 well the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended 
__label__0 this movie is similar to darkness falls and the boogeyman 2005 but it s also much more graphic than both and not as good as either it s also slow and fairly predictable it s also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror plus we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational inspirational sermon really this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything even though it is gory the makeup effects are not very realistic looking in fact they look kinda cheap aside from all that there is some really awful clichéd dialogue and i won t say when but there is a point where a couple of the character s actions were not authentic or believable given the circumstances nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way once you watch the movie you ll know what i mean there s also some gratuitous nudity for nudity s sake it just wasn t necessary at all the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good better than this movie deserves so after carefully weighing the evidence id say this movie was passable but not good my verdict for the tooth fairy 4 10
__label__0 first ifc runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip off is that town and country was watchable this isn t i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else s dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy doing a z grade dom deluise was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts the real crime besides this being green lighted is shepherd s character a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half million bucks if you buy that i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in 
__label__0  possible plot spoilers i adore dennis hopper i question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000 s the spreading ground this movie flat out sucks and i m about to tell you why this is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena one hitch there s a killer on the loose and that is bad for business the mayor makes a deal with the irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court det ed delongpre has other plans he wants this guy caught too but he s on the level and believes in the system he wants to see the system do it s job that could have been pretty good it could have been riveting it was horrible first they label this guy a serial killer err no there are specific criteria and none of it fits here the bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day and i think it was 2 the second day this entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period hardly serial killer action i don t care what warped motives they give him in the end serial killers do their deed over a long time span they do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days that s a spree ok that irritant aside the acting was atrocious the only name here was hopper and he s the only one who came even close to pulling off his part unfortunately he s kinda type cast to me and i think he does psycho parts much much better this just wasn t a good vehicle for hopper it didn t allow him to do what he does best which is to act all creepy it s not that he did bad it s that i ve seen him do so much better the irish mob guy johnny gault tom mccamus long day s journey into night who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff contradiction not really he is trying to play the cold hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden boring to the max he didn t scare me he didn t inspire any emotion at all except boredom i cannot tell you how many times i checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made for tv movie you know what i mean the poor production values low budget re use of scenes to save costs just eh yanno but i feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those derek vanlint was both the director and cinematographer on this project he bit off more than he could chew i can t help feeling that hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend that s the only rational i can come up with this was vanlint s first job as director third as cinematographer hopefully this was a learning experience for him i won t ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one but i do want to say that they all dropped the ball here even hopper in a scene that should have been emotionally gut wrenching for the detective it was just well blah i didn t see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear change this guy made very disappointing this 100 grueling minutes long and rated r for violence and language no kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this so no worries there it s not suitable for anyone anyway heh skip this one you ll thank me later 
__label__1 this movie is outrageous funny ribald sophisticated hits the bullseye where 99 of hollywood movies don t even make the target paul bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era he s the american renoir bunuel _ combined glad i have the videodisc 
__label__1 peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work because it shows what a talent peter falk is he doesn t play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it the depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play 
__label__0 ever wanted to eat worms here s a documentary to show you how yeah the kid eats live worms and that s about the most interesting part of the movie this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring i m totally in agreement here the movie just doesn t go anywhere unless you re fond of worm eating this is one movie it s almost impossible to write a spoiler for because nothing much happens now on the technical side they should have given that kid a haircut who s he trying to look like anyway bozo the clown it was almost comical i almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something and on top of that the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming all in all this movie nearly put me to sleep and my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting i will admit that the scenery was very impressive and had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hit it did seem safe enough for kids to watch the bear scenes and the oddball eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief skinny dipping scene didn t show anything i gave this one a very generous 3 
__label__1 saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debts the problem is that grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband s pounds in debts to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much she never worked before and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale 
__label__0 i really don t understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie i ve ever seen and i m not trying to be pessimistic eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i don t think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the make up everything the star i m giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executed don t watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch 
__label__1 one of the best movie dramas i have ever seen we do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work i highly recommend this one especially for those who have an interest in acting as a must see there are several scenes of note for one the graveyard scene when hamlet encounters yorick everyone knows about that scene by just going to elementary school and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done the logic used in this scene was tremendous i suppose a testament to shakespeare more than anything else for a second i very much enjoyed the scene where hamlet horatio and the character played by robin williams discussed the upcoming duel 
__label__1 in a word amazing i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan i was so totally wrong pinjar is a heart wrenching emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws i was haunted by it after watching it it lingered on my mind for so long the themes the pain the loss the emotion all was so real this is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful thanks to gulzar sahib and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie look no further this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart amazing cannot describe how excellent it is 
__label__1 this movie is now appearing on digital tv at least once a month i ve watched it a dozen or more times and it never ceases to delight me if it was on tomorrow i d watch it again such is the artistry that peter ustinov and maggie smith two great magicians of the acting profession can create helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of karl malden bob newhart and robert morley not forgetting others in minor roles it is a simple tale simply told of an ex con a lovable embezzler battling and succeeding with the then new age technology i e computers and finding affection in the process even if it is a tad tongue in cheek implausible even unbelievable the characters are not there is no violence no sex no bad language and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today a real lesson to modern movie makers on how to make a great show from and with virtually nothing except outstanding talent 
__label__0 well you d better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and pokey flick about a middle aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like set in tunis mom piddles around the flat gets antsy and decides albeit reluctantly she just can t help herself to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x2 and read the subtitles fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring uneventful low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits go figure c 
__label__1 first week of may every year brings back the memories of the holocaust through movies on televisions among many movies they showed this was the one i had not seen the story is about hilter s life and how he came to power it starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in germany the movie was earlier presented as a tv series and later converted into a movie format scottish actor robert carlyle plays adolf hitler with great guts conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this man it is a good screenplay and narrative that educates the audiences on the main events that lead hitler into power and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of hitler the movie is a biased viewpoint of the director christian duguay who shows hitler as a one track menacing angry and shouting person who had such a strong hold on the germans and people around him hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction and there the movie fails to convince hitler s portrayal even though the venture was for tv all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie the production value sets costumes etc were perfect there is a lot of criticism of this movie in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented but still the movie is gripping every engaging and entertaining robert carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does he is amazingly good brilliant i would have liked a more balanced view of hitler s life because i think hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust as i have told several times that very sadly our society loves to garland or prosecute one person as a representative of the society s good or evil respectively 
__label__1 when deathtrap was first released the poster reproduced on the cover of this dvd offered a graphic akin to a rubik s cube it is an appropriate image originally written for the stage by ira levin who authored such memorable works as rosemary s baby and the stepford wives the play was one of broadway s most famous twisters and under sidney lumet s direction it translates to the screen extremely well deathtrap is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous but the opening premise is extremely clever sidney bruhl michael caine is the famous author of mystery plays but these days he seems to have lost his touch after a particularly brutal opening night an old student named clifford anderson christopher reeve sends him a script for a play he has written it is called deathtrap and sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit just the sort of hit that would revive his career indeed a hit to die for and when clifford visits to discuss the play events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible like anthony shaffer s equally twisty sleuth deathtrap is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers still under the expert guidance of director sidney lumet it makes a more than respectable showing on the screen much of this is due to the cast which is remarkably fine michael caine gives a truly brilliant performance dyan cannon is funny and endearing as sidney s relentlessly anxious wife and christopher reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career if you can t see it in a first rate theatrical production this will more than do until one comes along gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
__label__1 i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little i m 22 years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i m shocked honestly by this rating of 5 8 i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can t stop ticking or that s the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl ann marie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film it s not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that it s just so cute and touching i know it s ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not they re just so loving and i think i m going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone it s a fun movie to watch 7 10
__label__1 wow i don t know what to say i just watched seven pounds no one can make me cry like will smith the man is very in tune with the vast range of human emotion this movie was skillfully and beautifully done rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today i would compare it to pay it forward and crash as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one not usually one for a bad ending but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end it is true to life that there aren t always happy endings sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you ll love this movie 
__label__1 i had a vague idea of who bettie page was partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of playboy apparently when she got her photo taken of her and her santa hat just that she didn t know what the mag was the movie co written and directed by american psycho s mary harron fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough a southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in new york city where she gets into modeling and from there a lot more soon she becomes the underground pin up sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title trait attributed to her the actress gretchen moll portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film she s not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well adam and eve were naked weren t they she comments a couple of times apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of page s life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period leaving behind the photo shoots for jesus in all the notrious bettie page is not much more than a kind of usual bio pic presented by hbo films albeit this time with the stamina for a feature film release the best scenes that harron captures are page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in over the top poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms this adds a much needed comic relief to the film s otherwise usual nature it s not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the government s investigation into the smut that came out of such photos and underground magazines but there isn t much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties it s all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along it s a watchable view if you re not too knowledgeable of bette page and probably for fans too 
__label__1 the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin s adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10
__label__1 i m writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and i am still reeling from the impact wildside has had on me it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded but it took it further and didn t stray from the realism of the streets often portraying life events and characters down to a t i am sorely missing this series instead we have are given the stupid underbelly which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of american esquire garbage wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series the acting was a grade and it s a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity i don t want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd not the first three give this series the ending it deserves 
__label__0 drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter ego all over town and it s really starting to become a pain in the butt after dee rents a flat from a hack writer her encounters with the other drew become more frequent writer dude feels that it s his responsibility to snap the real drew out of her stupor so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time not very interesting and even less scary but drew is sexy as usual especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger yeah drew that s hot best scene just might be where drew stabs her real life mom jaid with a big kitchen knife hmmm and how was your day 
__label__1 there are very few movies that are so funny as this one i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater reserved for movie buffs like me so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes at times the story was a bit slow but that is perhaps for the best a bit of rest in between the rolling amongst the aisles i nearly fell out of the seat was most welcome 
__label__1 after i watched the films i thought why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office even thought the movie had a clever unusal scenario the acting wasn t that good and the characters weren t very interesting for a korean movie i liked the fighting scenes if you want to watch a film without thinking this is the film for you but i got to admit the film was kind of childish 6 10
__label__1 this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it s very brief and with a distant camera shot and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracie s idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department now as for the rest of the film it s all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn t a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to 7 
__label__0 when i look for new cars i expect not to be shown boats when i drink fountain coke i should expect that the drink contains coke when i watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist i expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work this could have been people discussing my grannys diary the material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely tirade science i fell asleep the first time i tried to watch it the second time i stopped watching it i love science documentaries i would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster however this falls far short of providing anything worth your time avoid at all costs 
__label__0 for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show it s so incrediably trashy some ways sadly it s a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that we ve seen at least one episode it s part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently it s pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie pressley is in it she s playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it would ve been perfect then so i would recommend skipping ringmaster just watch the jerry springer show it s more enjoyable than this 2 10
__label__1 i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols and that is the reason i came watching this film the uniqueness of this film compared to other modern rockumentaries is that it s not just about one page of a band s history like i am trying to break your heart about wilco but rather covers long period of the band s history in this movie director producer ondi timoner closely followed friends rivals the brian jonestown massacre bjm and the dandy warhols dw for more than 8 years 1995 2003 and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video cut than to 1 45 hours the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film the result is astonishing there are no fillers the film is 100 pure and genuine archive footage which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands through all these years both bands in the start of their careers promised to make a revolution in the music making and not to sell their souls to the devil of record industry however their paths quickly diverged the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular especially in europe after only one album while the brian jonestown massacre with its self destruction bound leader anton newcombe dissolved into oblivion at least how it is portrayed in the film and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols first i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe for example courtney taylor the leader of the dandy warhols narrates but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film first it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project in the end he was ignored completely as if he was kicked out of the project everybody talk about bjm but he does not take part in the discussion i guess he wasn t even informed when the group started the final editing process there are always both sides of the story and here we have only one of course as one would expect anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends second the film is very dandy warhols biased sure the winner takes it all but the fact that courtney taylor leader of dw narrates even though it seems a good choice it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement and that bands late history is represented nonproportionally bjm is covered till 1997 and dw till 2003 does not add objectivity to the film third the movie is somewhat shallow what does it want to teach us as one critic said movie examines old questions where does genius fit into a commodified world can it thrive and get its due or does it need to self destruct to preserve its integrity no it does not examine these questions it just depicts a story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician narrated by a less brilliant but successful one who indulges in self assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain anyway the movie was fun it s raw it s fresh it s stylish it s just god damn interesting at least for the dw or bjm fans for the rest of the crowd i don t know 
__label__0 i ve seen other guinea pig films like mermaid in a manhole he never dies and while they re pretty sick they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark devil s experiment though is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there s no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever it isn t remotely scary except for perhaps the mind set but it s definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment now i m not the paragon of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze but this was too much for me really i m all for disturbing in fact i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible but this was a bit much the young woman is kicked beaten submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere if you think that sounds great go for it but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff 1 out of 10 absolutely nauseating 
__label__1 nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready it s short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here she s a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know though we learn immediately that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend it s a live in situation once julia gets to the house she s drugged and when she wakes up she s told she s mrs hughes and not allowed to leave the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it 
__label__0 pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation i enjoy watching bad movies like plan 9 from outer space but this thing doesn t even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood blaxploitation or 1970 s horror films after viewing this you get the feeling you ve wasted an hour and a half of your life 
__label__0 this is the only movie i have ever walked out on bad acting bad plot bad casting bad directing bad cinematography if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldn t have done a better job i hope they are proud of his turkey i m surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood don t waste your time 
__label__1 after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer 1976 to be the final chapter in the series dirty harry is back older more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer vigilante cops and vietnam veteran terrorists but now he s after a new killer a killer who wants payback by gunning down her attackers sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman played by sondra locke who was brutally raped along with her sister who is left traumitized ten years after she s out for revenge by gunning down her attackers at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack of which the mob are hunting him as well so in order to let the heat die down within the city harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well while hunting her attackers one by one harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar as he homes in on the killer s trails sudden impact in my opinion has to be one of my top 10 revenge films as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had a dark tone with entertaining value so do you feel lucky punk 
__label__1 all the folks who sit here and say that this movie s weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy o ms trogar exploding white mice the hall patrols instant classics nevermind the riff randell character if you don t like the ramones then you don t know rock and roll and you don t deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school 
__label__1 okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch it s about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses there s garam masala at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the comedy s not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn t deserve that many laughs but of course everyone s opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you re welcome to do so 
__label__0 i am a big fan of old horror movies and since i am middle aged old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920 s to 1960 s period i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being creepshow 1 which i thought was great i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending all the stories were great though so why did i like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it s telling you something 4 of 10 also romero s expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard i don t know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and that s not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on it s shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it 
__label__0 elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film considering the money and cast you d sure expect the film to be a lot better though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor it s not just the age difference but i just can t see the pair as a couple perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute due to miss leigh s deteriorating mental condition though i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well in addition for an english woman miss taylor doesn t even seem to try using an accent the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england their plan is to return to finch s tea plantation in ceylon sri lanka and at first it seems like a good life however there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her on top of that once back home finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her however taylor isn t yet ready to abandon her marriage but through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave when out of the blue cholera strikes the plantation so it s up to andrews finch and taylor to work together to save the day though by this point i really didn t care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you can t understand why taylor didn t leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell the film isn t particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount the film is a sluggish mess i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasn t integrated well in one scene for instance taylor finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown it s clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake despite its budget it s just not a very good or inspired film by the way could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film in some scenes particularly at the beginning she s wearing billowy clothes has a double chin and looks puffy this isn t a criticism after all women do get pregnant but if you look carefully you ll see what i mean also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant a great taylor film indeed it s amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much 
__label__0 from the stupid quaint african natives travelogue footage with our badly superimposed principals acting as narrators to the horrible fake ears which transform docile indian elephants into african elephants to the utter lack of any logic at all to maureen o sullivan s incessant whining of tarzan tarzan there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status 4 10
__label__0 spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made probably in the style of ed wood without the heart the lightning is terrible the music is very bad piano and orgue come on the acting is well there is no acting there s a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger the killer is a fat unscary clown who couldn t outrun a turtle every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort the end is so far the most stupid ever made think about it the guy ken hebert who s acting skill is about the same as his writing he s the brain behind this flop invite a co worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week end and kills them on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen the tragedy is that mr hebert try to make us beleive that it s a family affair that goes on for generation his uncle is the clown killer so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co worker goes missing whatever 
__label__0 they should have named this movie blonde women that needed to get their roots colored also the main character geeze the too tight sweaters the giggling thought the guy did a good job though i keep hoping we ll find a good 8 star christmas movie to watch this week the dart throwing had to laugh at that too we ve still got 3 more on the dvr to watch maybe we ll get lucky oh yeah i figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin i told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery and how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them creepy 
__label__1 this one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and kurosawa fans but i thought it was wonderful it s an episodic multi character study of tokyo s poorest who live in a city literally made from garbage though it looks like an a bomb just hit the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of technicolor the title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum all the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car when not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house an emotionally moving and beautiful film 
__label__0 i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor he has no passion in his play also the action in the original getaway was fantastic but the remake has no action it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 i don t understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico i think this is a mistake in the story so i think that there was no need to remake it or if they decided to remake a classic they must choose an excellent actor for the first role like johnny depp or brad pitt 
__label__0 i have seen many a horror flick in my time all of them absurdly bad but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to this movie made me angrier and angrier as i watched it as i tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about now after i ve seen it i understand sort of what was going on and why but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you re watching it yes there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence one liners that show the mind blowing insightfulness of its characters the highway belongs to me me and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the plot but still you ll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of like a puppy who isn t wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road blech 
__label__1 marlene dietrich and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life truly gorgeous cinematography and sets and yes dietrich s bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous she look great boyer looks young and trim story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex priest seeking life seems pretty stale but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works given the two stars the terrific score by max steiner and a good supporting cast the film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited plus certain characters just appear or disappear joseph schildkraut is funny as the arab guide c aubrey smith is the old priest lucile watson the mother superior tilly losch the dancer john carradine the diviner and basil rathbone plays well i m not sure he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything as others have noted john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich i can t help but think he would have been wonderful the role of world weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well and after the success of queen christina with garbo his career might have gotten back on track i can t think of any other 30s film dietrich did in color she looks great and wears some terrific clothes my favorite is the valentino as the shiek like outfit she wears by the pool certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars 
__label__1 let me start by saying that war inc is not everyone s cup of tea it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking oh crap the comedy involved the film isn t obvious at all it s quite subtle tamerlane tanks dry cleaning service etc and it changes with the twists turns in the plot i may be the only one but i won t compare this with grosse point blank because it s different john cusack i wouldn t say he was amazing or brilliant but he was good on the other hand his sister joan cusack was incredible in her delivery of lines comedic timing even though she was hardly in the film i d say the same about ben kingsley marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to pull it off hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah duff s development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job even though her accent is a tad unreal overall the film is what i would call entertaining it doesn t have a particular storyline and it s quite silly at times but it does have a subtle message i d say it s worth a watch

__label__0 cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is not bad as such but with redgrave toni collette glenn close meryl streep clare danes natasha richardson eileen atkins patrick wilson hugh darcy and others all giving fine performances you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance wait for cable 
__label__1 wow something of a surprise though flawed it is far better that i expected the brand new space liner arcturus with some 3 000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter without warning the ship s cerebral central computer sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate soon there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship s astrogators penny the captain cary and the director of the shipping line kenyon it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is actingerratically the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship andavoid personal conflicts in order to survive the film starts out very well the opening commercial is a very nice touch there are obvious parallels to 2001 a space odyssey and to the historicsinking of the titanic the film does slow down at times and has pacingproblems but is generally well made and well acted 
__label__0 i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing last days and some charlie chaplin films based on the quality of the other features i decided to give immortel a chance i nearly walked out of this movie and i like science fiction the story is set in a futuristic new york city filled with blade runner style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning synthetic humans unfortunately the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour and forty five minute movie three groups exist in this world humans artificial humans and egyptian gods the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city the humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation the egyptian gods have a floating pyramid modeled on the great pyramid of khufu and complete with a deteriorated exterior leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid wouldn t a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it s there i won t bore you with the so called plot but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross out scenes the film as i said looks to have been influenced by blade runner and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix at the end of the film credits were listed thank yous to the united kingdom france and italy the film is french but uses british actors who don t speak french hence it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed this is a distraction and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting it doesn t help that the animations are poor no better than a video game skip this one 
__label__1 would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement margaret sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other this movie sports what i think is frank morgan s most winning performance and with the wizard of oz and tortilla flat under his belt that is saying a lot the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy director ernst lubitsch might have thought trouble in paradise his favorite but this one he must surely consider a triumph with some of the wittiest dialogue american movies of the 30 s has to offer 
__label__1  protocol is a hit and miss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the u s government will the corridors of power in our nation s capital ever be the same hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol isn t as funny as her best film private benjamin but it s still a good movie and i did laugh alot out of four 
__label__0 i have never posted a review before but i had to do it for this film this film is so bad i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody but it isn t it is truly un self consciously bad this is a serious attempt that flops gloriously other reviewers have pointed out the film s many flaws so i ll try not to repeat these but i do urge you to see this film throughout it i was either speechless literally gasping with disbelief or rolling on the floor in hysterics i haven t had so much fun watching a film in years in fact i m going to try to get all my friends to see it because it s the kind of movie that needs to be shared my favorite parts when arthur auditions to be a go go boy his dancing is unbelievable the gratuitous nudity the director leading actor just had to get a nude shot in the preacher s office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of christ of course the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings what narrative function does this play the ex wife s wrestling match with ben to get possession of her gun the detailed sequence wherein arthur kills the preacher he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match yes the gay religious fanatic brother with his bleached hair and weho fashions and my favorite the use of joplin s the entertainer as the opening soundtrack and pachebel s canon in d major as the closing soundtrack the list goes on and on a must see 
__label__1 most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate examble remember the savage bees but i ll make an exception for tightrope which almost got it right here s one that doesn t inevitably get it wrong the accents are not too bad yes the yat accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern the city of 1950 is shown the way it is was without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky southerner one of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot 
__label__1 saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves 
__label__0 the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour remember no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in five the hard way he s the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor probably the most laughs you will have is with dr beck s epileptic seizures out of nowhere could mrs beck be anymore wooden seriously if you took a 4 foot branch stuck it in a hot tub you wouldn t be able to notice a difference the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll watch it as a late night movie mstified but don t go out of your way 
__label__1 when seeing this movie you should take notice to that it s not a normal movie it has no real story just characters a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony the dialogue is wonderful you can just lay back and listen the movie stands out thats why it s hard to find a right way of describing it thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one liners and things that differ from the normal you can t really put the finger on what s so wonderful about it it s just a comical world where gangsters rule a place of love and danger a movie that you can see more than one time 
__label__0 this movie is just plain bad weak story weak directing and below average acting the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising constantly for a well known internet provider it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this do not watch this it not worth your time 
__label__1 a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows groove tube hits and misses a lot overall i do really like this movie unfortunately a couple of the segments are totally boring a few really great clips make up for this a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie 
__label__0  except for jon heder this guy tanked the entire movie the plot sounded entertaining a 29 year old slacker son heder still lives with widowed mom keaton who happens to meet a new love daniels slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship he also meets a girl faris i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach heders performance is annoying which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you re upset about the end in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me 
__label__1 the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a reference you are missing a real treat doesn t matter how far we ve come in movie making makeup set designs no one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did he was and is tarzan 
__label__0 i don t even know where to begin on this one it s all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldn t be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie anaconda armageddon after all the man did co write bottle rocket and rushmore he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zeta jones should become a porn star there s no room in legitimate acting for her i m serious one of the worst movies i ve ever seen ever 
__label__1 i must admit at first i wasn t expecting anything good at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt s and hyde s image but i m glad to say it has much more to offer yes the acting is not that great but it doesn t suck either all the cast s well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it merges fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality the developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that s the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst it fulfills any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone 
__label__0 what on earth has become of our dear ramu is this the same man who made sarkar satya and comapny i refuse to believe so if aag was ramu s most ambitious project he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times this movie is made to fall like a brick i was cringing to leave the theater but i was forced to sit because i wouldn t have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left else nothing would have made me sit beyond interval this movie is nowhere close to sholay it doesn t even come near it within a mile i believe ramu surely loves the godfather more than sholay since sarkar was a classic piece of work i read ramu s interview a couple of days back in which the interviewer said that ramu doesn t sleep for more than 4 hours a day that too not at a stretch i completely agree with this now as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie there is no power in the performance amitabh bachchan doesn t even look scary he looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers i saw earlier ramu s favorite nisha kothari did a fantastic job in sarkar because she didn t have many dialogs in fact none if i remember clearly she opened her mouth in this movie and has found a place in history the new guy playing jai s role seems to have that brash look but didn t manage jai s role at all i cant go on im sorry my pain is too big for me to manage right now i promised myself throughout the movie that i will watch the original sholay once more just to see that it is still there bottom line horrible movie the media and critics are going to cook ramu s goose and just to remind all readers once more i am one of the biggest ramu fans and even i cant spare him for this act 
__label__1 the star of this film is the screenplay attention to detail for the period in dress language social mores we don t hurt women and the politics are remarkable it is a reminder of kosovo to day the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step a great film 
__label__1 being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i don t live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context this movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons a girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super cruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super annoying after having seen it you feel almost nothing you re not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe that s why i gave it 7 points it made me react in a way i never reacted before if that s good or bad is up to you 
__label__0 i m actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti christian pseudo documentary got now i respect the guy s opinion and faith i myself am not at this state believer of the taught christian doctrine however anti christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue this film has valid points but they are very few and represented in a very biased context i m not recommending against seeing it in fact i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings rather than an inquiring approach on the subject it looks like a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists no moderation in between the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti christian historians and writers i actually found the headmaster to be the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry with this being said there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased 
__label__0 i ve seen my fair share of badly thought out endings and final twists to films but i don t recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey individually or collectively the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was ill conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far fetched what s worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie ain t that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema 
__label__1 when i saw this movie i was amazed that it was only a tv movie i think this movie should have been in theaters i have seen many movies that are about rape but this one stands out this movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today let alone tv movies it tells a story that i m sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today and i found it to be very believable which is something hard to find in other rape centered movies i also thought that tiffani theissen and brian austin green were awesome in the parts that they played i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them i enjoyed it very much 
__label__1 basically the exact same movie as house of wax vincent price s first genuine horror hit released the previous year but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period set pieces joyous 3 d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price s character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw gallico s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallico s inventions are the rightful property of the company the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallico s once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico s rival the great rinaldi inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but also being a master of creating disguises recreates his victim s image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50 s horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross out moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the 3 d delights near the beginning of the film like a yo yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as time filler and contemporary 50 s hype but it s still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre 
__label__0 woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other this is the case with melinda and melinda where all the characters speak with allen s generic pseudo sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where allen lives they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will ferrel as the obligatory woody allen surrogate although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression like kenneth branagh in the god awful celebrity ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies the end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years 
__label__1 this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome the character development in this film is excellent we get to believe that harry is a businessman who neglects his family and georges is an innocent man who craves loving and care from the normal society acting is excellent and the cannes best actor award is well deserved the fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that georges misery towards his abandonment by his family and his desire to be treated like a normal person the song that gets played repeatedly also reinforces this message the film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured we have been treating them with discrimination and neglect a fact that is highlighted by the scene where georges gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen if we get to understand and share these people s world both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy i was so drawn into the film and the characters emotional experiences it is a touching film for good natured souls 
__label__0 i think scarecrows are creepy so it s a pity this movie doesn t make more of them a bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive when they move on the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows it is as alfred hitchcock says a bomb under a table goes off and that s surprise we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and that s suspense 
__label__1 actually my vote is a 7 5 anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it don t misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends i think that not exactly but who cares also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr rock won with his movie i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher however the film is good 
__label__1 a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war when a spanish republican sent by his soon to be overthrown government charles boyer infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain he upsets the locals getting convincingly beaten in one scene and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood notwithstanding socio economic hierarchy xenophobia and world politics this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe and manages more than once to get under your skin 
__label__1 a delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce the last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating despite this major plot and style flaw it s worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting many fine little bits to savor like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card made more piquant when we re not quite sure the card is not maxed 
__label__1 russ and valerie are having discussions about starting a family the couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles at the same time a dedicated adoption agency owner takes a mini vacation and leaves the orphanage in the charge of his father leslie nielsen father harry is in the rental business and he gets the brilliant idea to rent some of the children of the orphanage to couples like russ and valerie harry who becomes aware of the couple e dilemma offers a family of siblings for a 10 day rental period brandon kyle and molly move into the apartment with their temporary parents with amusing consequences as the new caretakers are inexperienced with kids but where is the possibility of a happy ending this is a darling family film the actors including nielsen as the wheeler dealer and christopher lloyd as the kind apartment doorman are all wonderful the script is snappy and fun and the overall production values quite high yes if only life could be this way orphaned children everywhere deserve a chance to prove that they are lovable and can give so much joy to the parents who are considering adoption if you want to show a film to your family that is rooted in good values but is also highly entertaining find this movie it is guaranteed to have everyone laughing even as their hearts are melting 
__label__0 this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th annivesery dvd special edition blazing saddles imagine the movie without the satire humor or writing skills but with all the trappings of a typical lame 70 s sit com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you ll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was what the hell was lou gossett jr thinking when he signed onto this disaster this was possibly the worst thing he s been in and yes i m including the first punisher movie and iron eagles 3 steve landesberg i understand as he can t say no to crap my grade f
__label__1 one of the all time great science fiction works as visionary and thought provoking as blade runner or even gilliam s own brazil willis gives his best performance here but he s outdone by pitt s incredibly frenetic turn that s unlike anything he s done before or since even stowe isn t out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten 
__label__0 this utterly dull senseless pointless spiritless and dumb movie isn t the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post trainspotting movies the beach already took care of that what this low budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs booze ego self delusion bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once promising director s quick demise the premise is absurd two losers ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g a rapper likely meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit making duo which they become a friend of theirs an even bigger illiterate loser becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video camera by which he films them in action and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage now i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk but this is ridiculous the music makes oasis seem like the beatles during the studio recordings the duo strumpet change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it and quite absurdly they do take it not only is the music total and utter trash but its performers are anti social these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots it s just too dumb it s plain awful the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere and this rags to bitches story has no point and makes no sense it often feels improvised under the influence of drugs danny boyle is a complete idiot this little piece of trash is so bad it s embarrassing to watch ecclestone s i q also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense whoever financed this 1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners 
__label__1 this movie is a true masterpiece it really is it s rare you come across such a heartwarming flick full of fun laughter heartbreak and with a little drama to keep you on your toes a true family film homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities the voice acting is that good shadow is a wonderful character old wise and brave and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment chance who wouldn t love a dog like chance he s got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen and sassy is very witty for a cat she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper here kitty kitty kitty not on your life chubby there were also lots of well made emotional scenes such as sassy going over the waterfall i was truly scared for her shadow falling in the ditch almost in tears and then the fantastic ending when all three pets return home including good old shadow a favourite for all time anyone who doesn t like this film must just not like animals rent it or buy it now and it ll leave you with happy memories that ll last a lifetime 
__label__1 i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney this movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and i have been looking for it i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once i really hoped i would get to see it again the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory to this day i never did see it after that day back in the 70s in fact i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me i loved it and want my kids to see it does anybody know where i can find it 
__label__0 kalifornia is disturbing i believe there is no reason for this story to be told it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value technically the movie is very well make the performances are top rate and first class the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest but at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency i recommend kalifornia to no one 
__label__1 can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say i liked it it s reasonably funny by bits it got great stars and it s gorgeous to look at the songs there are about two which are then repeated are forgettable but they get a healthy ironic treatment such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered there isn t much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around miss grable and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed but the result still is very uplifting the photography including real outdoor shots which are a thrill is amazing playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side but still fresh and comfortable in this continental olde worlde comedy it s pretty much along the line of down to earth with rita hayworth and that one tends to be rather disliked by many so i suppose several people would deem that lady in ermine to be outdated and stuffy but it s a fairy tale and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow my suggestion is just enjoy the artwork the costumes the witty script and everything else this film has to offer and stop complaining the film has been released on dvd in germany with both german and english soundtrack 
__label__1 being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decent decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giant monster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film by far yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert and really he s not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesn t even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and he s pretty much in the whole movie and in typical low budget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there s even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there yes the special effects aren t the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad movie yeti never stoops as low as say a p e does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isn t that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesn t get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong 76 rip offs like a p e and queen kong by very far 
__label__1 freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy gang caper stoner film and feel good british movie it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre stars phil daniels gary stretch and geoff bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic the main story centres around their road trip from london to wales and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way this small film also has a great heart it is not just for bike fans as it bases around the character s relationships with each other including dreams and regrets such as gary stretch s fred longing for the family he left behind the cinematography is also great a love letter to the welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of london streets and typical pub life in the welsh country towns stylish slick fantastic soundtrack likable characters and funny storyline i would recommend freebird in a heartbeat 
__label__1 i agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings it s trippy nighy was fab in his role nail nailed it beano was the typical drummer and rea kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet aubrey s performance was gorgeous the scenes between aubrey robinson killed me perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out they ought to i ve told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy nail s character it s supposed to be rock roll not the phantom of the f g opera 
__label__1 i haven t laughed that much in a long time although the movie has some sad moments too especially when it changes from hyper funny to honest and serious the characters are very realistic most of the times sappy sometimes but quite believable i am not a fan of the jerry springer show i feel sorry for the participating people this film instead is a satire and it is doing great too bad that all expletives were beeped out while this movie aired on public tv that takes a lot of fun out of it i will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it 
__label__1 four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixed up parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit she s never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can t slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard or an even longer sequence also with baio where foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i didn t much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and jodie s face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this it doesn t pander for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand from 
__label__0 even if it were remotely funny this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful stopping just short of digging up the boys corpses and re enacting weekend at bernie s but only just producer larry harmon and the director of the frickin ernest films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over stan and ollie s legacy gailard sartain does a fair ollie impersonation but bronson pinchot wouldn t reach tenth place in a stan lookalike contest even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable the less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better makes utopia look like a dignified swan song 
__label__0 after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different 10 items rushes the viewer through the 1 day time line of the movie whereas the better planned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long days i m sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub 10mil limited release movies and indie films 
__label__0 surely no saturday morning tv kids show was ever done this poorly after all those producers had to count on the audience coming back well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets the script could have been a reject from some long forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool dude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along the spaceship props are absurd a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for example but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history most are crude drawings and it s all bathed in an often misfocused red light even mohr s bare hairy chest is used as a prop and it s a bad one as rib thin as the plot any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians and will probably agree completely 
__label__1 i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip hardesty a hardworking and dedicated fbi agent his life in the bureau is intercut with his family life which is not all rosy his wife an excellent portrayal by vera miles lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job and they even separate for a time chip s best friend and fellow agent sam crandall murray hamilton is killed in a gunfight chip s son mike enlists in the marines during world war ii through it all the family carries on with bravery and dignity the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi documentary style of the film works effectively and the music by max steiner says it all fidelity bravery and integrity this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the fbi and yes to j edgar hoover as well if mr hoover s type of vigilance had been observed we might have been spared 9 11 the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we ve had to put up with since his passing 
__label__0 i don t know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd orcas are most definitely not the cold blooded killer this movie makes them out to be its silly orcas are extremely intelligent don t get me wrong but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was so i was at least somewhat amused by it personally i d recommend going and seeing jaws if you re wanting to see an animal killing humans type of movie but if you re like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i d say go ahead d:D
__label__1  most of us at least inhabit two worlds the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within the unconscious a safe place where we can escape with those words mr gone introduces inside the world of the maxx a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined inspired in the comic books of sam kieth the maxx is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired not only in the story but also in the graphic style that look like the pages of the comic giving this show a surreal and unique appearance but also the story it s interesting and entertaining at moments it could turn too weird but when you got inside it it s hard to get out of it the story and the characters are wonderfully developed the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere unfortunately like many good animated shows this one was short lived the maxx is a must see it s one of my all time favorites

__label__0 polyester was the very first john water s film i saw and i have to say that it was also the worst movie i had seen up to that point water s group of talent included several people who i am sure worked for food and were willing to say the lines waters wrote every thing about the movie is terrible acting camera editing and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite divine was purely absurd that said i have to recommend this film because it is very funny and you won t believe the crap that happens to poor francine her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting women s feet at the grocery store her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town her husband is a cackling a hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor francine francine s only friend is played by edith massey possibly the worst actress ever edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming despite all of francine s travails waters cooks up a fabulous hollywood ending and everyone who survives lives happily ever after 
__label__1 set in 2017 although one might easily mistake it for 1987 judging by the hairstyles and clothing the running man sees all round good guy ben richards schwarzeneggar framed for a crime he didn t commit after a daring prison break he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female amber maria conchita alonso used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses the show pits convicts against a range of colourful and often quite camp opponents each having his own unique killing style dynamo fires electricity from a special suit buzzsaw uses chainsaws sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick and fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders but these killers are no match for ben richards who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner followed by the obligatory witticism towards the end of the movie ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities and gets to exact revenge on the show s nasty host killian twenty years ago arnold schwarzeneggar ruled the action movie universe and to his legion of fans he could do no wrong the austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies comic book violence plus logic free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one liners minus acting ability equalled massive profits the running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and arnie s mostly male teenage audience lapped it up myself included now two decades later and having just finished re watching the movie for the first time in years i find it a strange movie one totally devoid of technical merit decent acting and convincing effects yet somehow totally entertaining directed by paul michael glaser best known as det dave starsky from cult 70s cop show starsky and hutch and adapted from a short story by stephen king writing under the nom de plume richard bachman the running man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated yet despite or maybe because of the film s shoddiness it has a special charm which is hard to describe with no attempt at creating a realistic near future setting the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles check out the scene in which ben discovers amber s secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes marvel at the crap futuristic graphics used on advertising billboards and the running man board game as a graphic designer i found these particularly amusing be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements the running man may be utter rubbish but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no hesitation in recommending to fans of arnie and sci fi action in general 
__label__1 one of the few best films of all time the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellence the plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it doesn t discriminate i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise 
__label__1 sure it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny but at least the filmmakers didn t try while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy but the scene with the mountain lion was intense i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly s role in the film as a rebellious shock jock but then again it s a tv movie despite all of the good things the soundtrack was atrocious however it was nice to see tucson arizona prominently featured in the film 
__label__1 going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes john waters happy birthday john made this parody of the celebrity art world edward furlong plays the title character a working class teenager in baltimore who loves to photograph things when a new york agent lili taylor discovers his work she offers him his big break which he accepts but once he hits it big he has to reconsider everything basically pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity the sort of thing that we might expect sure but with waters directing there s always a few things to shock us you ll know them when you see them i certainly recommend it also starring christina ricci mink stole and patty hearst 
__label__1 if you re a fan of film noir and think they don t make em like they used to here is your answer they just don t make em in hollywood anymore we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a well made film from that genre can be read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent cassel the basic plot could have been written in the 40 s dumb but appealing ex con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex love hate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money all action takes place in depressing seedy and or poorly lit locations audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake this is old school film noir it s as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i ve seen all year 
__label__1 two sailors are on leave ladies man joseph brady gene kelly and shy innocent clarence doolittle frank sinatra they meet beautiful susan abbott kathryn grayson and both fall in love with her there s more but you ve probably guessed it the story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick also this movie is far too long it s 140 minutes and that s way too much for such a silly story there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra still this is worth catching when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won t care it s shot in rich technicolor with all the gloss mgm had the acting is ok kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and sinatra is just great although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too grayson is given nothing to do but she s incredibly beautiful to look at some shots of her literally took my breath away there are plenty of highlights here sinatra and kelly s big dancing and singing number sinatra singing anything grayson s two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerry an animated mouse tom does a funny cameo too also there s little dean stockwell who steals every scene he s in so it s too long and the plot just doesn t hold up but it s still worth catching this was a huge hit in its day 
__label__1 the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes although i don t mention it in great detail earth is an approx 90 minute cinema version based on planet earth which i watched all on bbc tv the tv version was narrated by david attenborough a captivating commentator who i had wished had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star trek s captain picard there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that s may be appropriate in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it there are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica 3 animal families polar bear elephant and whale appear in more than one of these parts each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is we see something of each kind of animal but only mammals and birds and some fish and some beautiful shots of vegetation mountains waterfalls deserts and jungle a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or villages or cities aren t in the film so it s a typical nature documentary but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me it is a family film so no brutal killings of any animals when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it s shot in slow motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit 6 in the netherlands no blood is shed some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be adored by kids it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took 4000 and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty it had it s dutch premiere yesterday a month before the actual release in a cinema of 500 seats of which 15 were taken true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers it seems as i knew the tv series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie some didn t but the most impressive shots big waterfalls did luckily it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film 
__label__1 i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrock s films and to me this is the funniest it reminds me of early jackie chan movies admittedly ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady this film while probably not the best of all her films was the most entertaining 
__label__0 i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that my girl friend turned to me and said we have to go see this movie enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren t even any of those it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music there was absolutely no character development the plot is just well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer that s brilliant hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me her longest line must have been half a sentence and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don t go see this and if your like me and don t have a choice well then i wish you good luck maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine can t believe this film got made 
__label__1 canadian director vincenzo natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions i ve been eagerly awaiting natali s follow up and although its taken five years for him to mount another project i m delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man s place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control i don t want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it s head cypher is such a film morgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company digicorp they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars to his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese while morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into rita foster an impeccably cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brush off but there is something to her he finds irresistible that s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in when rita turns up at another one of morgan s seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears and i m not saying anything more about the plot to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path that s so much fun to follow as with cube natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they re thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but it s not a carbon copy of cube it has it s own inspiration cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it s as much of a shock to us as it is to him one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns cypher is also on a low budget but natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity natali s direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it s so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because it s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in identifying double agents and it s a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by hewlett all he has to do is look at morgan and we re drawn into his complex mind game but it s lucy liu who s the scene stealer here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone things come to a very gratifying end that doesn t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after he s been put through the ringer like this i cheered for him in the final scene it s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes cypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining it s everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn t and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix a fine follow up from natali and now i m a committed fan of the man superb stuff 
__label__1 i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn t historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it 
__label__0 if you haven t seen this it s terrible it is pure trash i saw this about 17 years ago and i m still screwed up from it 
__label__1 keeping all political views aside feroz khan and anil kapoor s gandhi my father is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused towards family side of mohandas karamchand gandhi and the fight of his eldest son harilal gandhi with the society his larger than life father and most importantly demons in his head one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their fatherthe acting is good shefali shetty darshan zariwala and akshaye khanna strictly in that order add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the finger feroz khan s direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive however the screenplay could ve been tighter i had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type dvd it was called mahatama vs gandhi i think and it was certainly more gripping though the movie s background score and the father son and mother son moments are just a brilliant treat this movie could have been great it s borderline to that it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both somewhere the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions nothing comes to you it compares decently to other gandhi s certainly not an overview film like kingsley s gandhi or abstract as kamal hassan s hey ram the film just about manages to find its footing however one is left wondering what if worth a watch 7 5 10
__label__1 i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn t automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that i ve seen that getting better doesn t just happen it s hard work and takes time it s a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this 
__label__0 it is quite simple friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults with unsophisticated sense of humour it is also painfully obvious that towards the end they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons most likely so they could say they beat seinfeld s 9 season run the trouble with this is seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing friends had and i m being very generous here at most 5 or 6 ok seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons it became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren t that good so start with then got worse at the 100th time you saw them i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly it is truly awful 
__label__1 this movie catches a lot of flak but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered clothed version of the film that played us television and has also been issued to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like alpha unicorn etc this movie never had a theatrical release in the states although it was picked up by avco embassy in 1973 in spain at the time when there was nudity involved the filmmakers shot two versions one with clothes and one with out the fully uncut english dubbed export print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the 80 s it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended my guess is avco cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened in 1974 it was released by avco to television titled fury of the wolfman and the clothed version was used for this tv print cut to 12 years later and fury of the wolfman pops up on home video on the charter label this version appears to be what avco was going to release back in 73 it s the uncovered version with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie there are several scenes on the charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the tv print the source for all those dollar dud s and vhs editions but a comparison to the fully uncut wolfman never sleeps reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version spoilers in next paragraph the scene where ilona has waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete after whipping him into submission she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf the werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat it s not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for us audiences or more likely the mpaa ilona is desperately in love with waldemar and could not possess him hence her whole scheme to mind control waldermar s wife and involve her in an affair she wanted to wreck his marriage and she accomplishes this while waldemar is in tibet unfortunately he returns a werewolf but this does not slow her down a bit if she can t physically have him as a man she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense in the uncut version it would seem ilona s affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping the other cut is a complete scene of waldemar in bed with karen and she is seen naked a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow werewolf vs the vampire woman as well the film does have it s problems though for certain the director was drunk the bad stand in for the werewolf at points the atrocious english dubbing the inclusion of sequences from the first waldemar film mark of the wolfman aka frankenstein s bloody terror and the grotesque overuse of that film s music score throughout etc but seen in it s original widescreen format and uncut ie werewolf never sleeps it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the daninsky werewolf series with a plot line unmatched in it s everything but the kitchen sink approach the cut clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors and unfortunately that s the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen the film carries a 1970 copyright and i d bet the 1972 release date on the imdb is incorrect the film precedes werewolf shadow aka werewolf vs the vampire woman in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow the ending of werewolf never sleeps fury of the wolfman dovetails directly into the opening of werewolf shadow offering concrete evidence of this sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles the english dubbing severely hurts the movie but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era where nudity was verboten 
__label__0 this film is awful not offensive but extremely predictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid 60 s the father the principal at the school is going through a mid life crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students minds with some thought provoking stuff like think for yourself the principal doesn t agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the dots his teenage daughter winona ryder wannabe tara frederick is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some bad advice hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn t being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv this movie plays like a more adult version of an after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms 
__label__0 i m sorry but this is just awful i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don t believe me there is nothing wrong with the idea modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say hey my watch has stopped imagine lines like that being repeated 15 times before they say anything else and you have the movie s lack of greatness in a nutshell 
__label__1 i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you don t have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you don t mind here goes alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alex s affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end it s revealed veronika is pregnant with alex s child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilberte s situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebrun s character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed not a bad effort 7 10 
__label__0 another priyadarshan vohra flick another movie that was seen for tp rather than actual desire the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie akshay paresh and many others but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie i was happy with the casting in general except rajpal yadav who once again annoys to no limit he does however extract some laughs but these were those standard slapstick non original jokes in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner for an extended period who are considered great which brings us to the other instrument the dumroo hardly requires any talent it has no variations and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances hmm sounds like rajpal yadav good analogy but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the dhol does this movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played sometimes the dhol was played sometimes the dumroo sometimes both together but mostly the dumroo played alone and the monkey danced and like any 24 year old sooner than later i got bored the movie has some good dhol good moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying dumroo entertaining initially then tolerable then irritating the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on mere bhains ko anda kyun mara if you haven t watched it watch it on filmy it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny this movie had its moments the actors did a fine job except rajpal yadav who can act though i ve seen him in main meri patni who annoys more than entertains i ve said it many time and i ll say it again i really think sharman joshi and tushar kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi star comedies especially some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other but after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added this mean that once the girl was in the following 45 60 mins was increasingly torturous the climax was so bad its almost good category i mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable the movie is also extremely predictable there s hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag the movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump down or up and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl most of the really bad scenes were towards the end one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition the last 10 15 was especially distatefull and completely spoils this movie i didn t find tanushree datta quite the siren she was to play and her acting talent is in serious question especially in view of her non appealing looks if you cant be a hot and cant act how much time can you survive technically also this movie was weak with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera work the songs except the title track were no good either when the songs played in the 2nd half i could feel the collective gasp from the audience in all a movie that s just ordinary merely because of the cast and the very low expectations avoiding it wont be a bad idea and if it has to be watched watching it on tv for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed s lots of stale jokes rajpal yadav last 45 mins and last 15 mins especially bad technically bad songs s tries to be more than what it was not the regular cast i m happier for it tanushree datta s some good scenes towards the beginning title song good acting and cast except ry total 4 5 10 i m trying to be objective here i don t like rajpal yadav or tanushree datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations so i m giving it the benefit of all doubts on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4 
__label__0 greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers this film opens with incest and purposeless meaningless casual incest at that that s greenaway s big problem he prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful technical skill isn t enough he s just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity 
__label__1 corbin bernsen s sent letters to four criminal associates he s worked with in the past and it s a real intergenerational mix with fred gwynne lou diamond phillips william russ and ruben blades they re to meet him in this obscure montana town and he doesn t explain why because he s then picked up by out of state police from new jersey on a warrant of the criminal group that s been gathered together they all know bernsen but don t know each other a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out as the oldest gwynne though denying it kind of takes charge with the others grumbling but going along especially when they figure out what bernsen had in mind as for bernsen he s got the good fortune to be picked up by a pair of bumblers in ed o neill and daniel roebuck he gets the drop on o neill and escapes after that it s the four criminals trying to finish what bernsen started and bernsen getting away the police in the intricately plotted screenplay it s fascinating how both story lines keep intertwining with each other hoyt axton as the local sheriff watches in amazement at what unfolds in his town disorganized crime is a fabulously funny caper film by a bunch of players who seem mostly to have had a background in television or would soon i can t say that anyone stood out in the cast they also seem to click so well together ironically none of these people are comedians per se but they all exhibit a light comic touch that good directing brought out disorganized crime is one very funny caper movie the kind of film that well known pessimist mr murphy would have written 
__label__0 brokedown palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see i also did not like the movie when some aussie man smuggled drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug smuggling i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie in fact this movie stinks i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women germany is the country i tolerate i also would rather stick to the united states instead after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling i left the theatre and had my money refunded because i cannot tolerate this movie if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler forget this 
__label__0 revolution is a terrible movie i don t care if you re a history teacher news writer al pacino fan there s no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate 10 the key point to the plot is tom dobb al trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat everything revolves around that note tom s son joins the army to make up for the note making tom join the army as well they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat the end it had a few battle scenes and they were pretty mediocre at best transistions between scenes used five months later and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle the love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow so save your notes and watch the patriot instead 
__label__0 i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasn t impressed i know it s taboo to knock independent films but this one felt devoid of entertainment the premise was interesting but the execution of it fell short i found myself thinking okay they re just getting into it the story will pick up soon before i knew it the film was over and the story never picked up i can t say i found the acting all that impressive either it was pretty bad not star wars prequel trilogy bad but bad nonetheless i m not sure what the running time was i ll assume two hours because it s a safe estimate anyway when the film was finished i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through again i was thoroughly unimpressed and eventually bored out of my wits i m not one of those guys who requires fast paced action and explosions in a film so don t start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it 
__label__1 i can safely admit as an imdb geek that phantom lady will never crack into my film noir top twenty it may not even sneak into the top fifty but rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre it should be noted that phantom lady has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing all that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning the film doesn t get cooking until kansas ella raines sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss scott anderson alan curtis who has been convicted of murder kansas is anderson s secretary by day and amateur detective by night as the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of new york at night little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together to be honest the film belongs to raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest i m not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film as interesting as raines is as a novice detective things really accelerate into another hidden gear when kansas pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer elisha cook jr in search of some information to help her condemned boss she and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the all night jazz clubs trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet it could ruin the scene all together you ll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out if you re lucky enough to have this film on dvd you ll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again as good as raines is it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy it is mainly because of this scene that i rate phantom lady a 7 instead of a 6 for the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene it is the drum sex scene that separates this film from any others of the same ilk and just like it is said in the film that you never go wrong with vanilla i would also like to add that going with vanilla is the safe fall back choice when one can t decide on having a tastier treat 7 10 clark richards
__label__0 so back when herbie made his first appearance i was perfectly happy watching dean jones mug away i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn now unfortunately i have expectations of a riveting delightful story whenever i watch a movie if i m not on some sort of medication and this is another good movie for the medicated there are no major laughs no complex plot lines no difficult twists herbie fully loaded is great for the fully loaded this was the first time i had seen la lohan on the screen since she swapped places with jamie lee curtis i thought she was excellent in that and i can t say i was terribly impressed this time around aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color she just didn t ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers her need for speed wasn t portrayed consistently in the film perhaps it was elsewhere she looked older than her part and seemed to always be looking for something a party designer togs new place to spend money off set i couldn t see any chemistry with justin long that romance seemed obligatory at best the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with matt dillon who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy it was great to see herbie again and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies if disney had popped out with some car 53 jewelry i might have worn some just to be loyal his new feature was a little inconsistent does he channel the thoughts of his driver does he now skateboard but whatever we all knew how it was going to end but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had hammered home what would have made the movie worthwhile have the old herbie in a real story with a real plot at the very least herbie s as good as lassie but clearly that s asking too much why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as herbie goes bananas and the computer that wore tennis shoes when it comes to innovation i m sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations for the rest of us it s for when you have the flu and just can t take the suspense of rear window 
__label__0 once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling science fiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era and then it happened 1997 countless awards obscene amounts of money outlandish barrage of advertising maximum profit margin titanic was here i have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout quickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills 90210 the acting was more wooden than my nephew s tree house images meant to terrify were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false don t even get me started because there s too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not it was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boy with car chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sex starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick flick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money i d do it if i had those kind of chances in life it is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically false human interest tripe like the patriot and pearl harbor 
__label__1 this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong s new wave that began with tsui hark s zu warriors of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new wave s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burning paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance it s not that there isn t humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw but this is just as humans are not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time when irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of red lotus temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before he is the very incarnation of milton s satan from paradise lost better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he can t get to satan s hell soon enough he ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule that s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it s not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as all encompassing reality thus there s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in charge of course fortunately the film doesn t end there though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all 
__label__1 there s a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn t direct a horror film of quality if he had to and sleepwalkers screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this i like sleepwalkers though i fully am aware that garris just says f ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway it s about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers feline human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents moving from town to town living a nomadic existence truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn t surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother shan t tolerate the possible death of her beloved son garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacher glenn shadix suspecting handsome all american charmer charles brady brian krause to be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles lures pretty virgins into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama mary alice krige the fresh new target is tanya robertson mädchen amick and she seems to be easy pickens but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle thanks to a deputy s cat clovis mary s vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son like many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy dolenz i was smitten with mädchen amick she s simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his ulterior motives i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i would ve welcomed her in the genre with open arms krige is yummy as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya s parents in one fail swoop in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn cob she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman before cracking his arm a bone protruding knocking him unconscious with his own elbow she tosses tanya s mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father s face a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop kebab falling on the pencil for extra impact poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans we see mary and charles abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers joe dante and john landis as photograph experts the film is shot in a tongue in cheek let it all hang out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home it s about the ultra violence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris direction and king s screenplay the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in your face without a lick of complexity this is closer in vein to king s own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works 
__label__1 cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it s not the run of the mill sci fi flick the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what s going on the close up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive the sci fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie the technology used in the movie isn t overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props the character development is intentionally shallow the main character jeremy northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage it s up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it s the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end 
__label__0 this could have been interesting a japan set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly installed american family but falls flat due to an over simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare i e the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they re expected to besides it doesn t deliver much in the scares department a giant crab attack is merely silly as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as susan george seducing diplomat friend of the family doug mcclure and edward albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there eventually he s called upon to exorcise the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death at the end of the day this emerges an innocuous time waster tolerable at just 88 minutes but in no way essential viewing 
__label__1 i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago and i was very happy with the movie when i left it it s very intense and the closest i ve come to crying in a movie in quite some time that is a credit to adam sandler who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels and who probably deserves an oscar nom for it were it not coming out so early in the year don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to adam s disturbed there is some humor but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him adam plays two levels very well when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable but when he is well less stable he s powerful and dark i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss 
__label__0 i wanted to see it because of two reasons one it was the remake of high sierra with bogart two the bogart part was played by jack palance whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility as in the big knife but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake the film follows the same plot as hig sierra only here the actors don t care the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she s doing in this film i don t even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role and of course they had to use the dog story again they surely could have come up with some different ideas perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra but that definitely doesn t add any quality to the film it s a waste of time if you ve seen high sierra before otherwise why not see a pseudo film noir as for me i d rather die than see it one more time 
__label__1 i picked this up in the danger after dark box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore fest and with very bad dialogue which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way that sho gackt develops through the movie as a person the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good considering they aren t professional actors and the director did a marvelous job with it all setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards on a side note taro yamamoto s performance was very surprising the only other film i ve seen him in is battle royale where he plays shogo kawada and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo toshi is bright exuberant and hyper serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it so watch out for his performance if you re familiar with battle royale you ll be very surprised by him but don t be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box because this isn t really a vampire movie it s just a movie with a vampire in it that hyde s character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what s really going on in the foreground and you guys will love the last scene it s a really moving picture at some points the photography is really well done it s definitely something to pick up the next time you re at blockbuster 
__label__1 as this movie is completely in swiss dialect it s probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie i m not from switzerland but i worked there for some years so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings i ve seen a lot of movies of this kind eg scary movie loads of scifi spoofs etc but this one is the best one of that kind i ve seen so far i give a 9 of 10 the only reason i can t give a 10 is because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd so there s almost no chance for non swiss to understand 
__label__0 ok so chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced i have one question why who read this script and said sound s great original this movie is regurgitated crap that i wouldn t tarnish my toilet bowel with of course it is another story following in the tradition of mia invasion usa walker texas ranger delta force and so on in which chuck norris of course is the one man who can same america from some bad guys he doesn t even need a gun most times it s stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris film s is chuck s son eric eric norris has primarily worked on all his father s films and tv shows doesn t this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent afterall he s directing the same people as before in the same stories as before only difference is the characters names if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined hopefully this will be the nail in chuck norris s acting coffin

__label__1 hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn t without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable i know i can t use this word forever but i can t think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn t rank along the best 7 5 10 bethany cox

__label__0 it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb because i would not have hesitated in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars i like many others bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it it could be good no chance this film was shocking imagine a movie length the bold and the beautiful well primal instinct did not even come close to that good and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length the bold and the beautiful michael madsen how could you do this to us the worst part is i didn t fast forward a bit i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film where do i start directing zero stars screenplay zero stars acting zero stars cinematography zero stars digital effects zero stars production design zero stars make up zero stars casting zero stars editing zero stars trailer half a star graphic design half a star dvd menu half a star however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list

__label__1 in die nibelungen siegfried siegfried was betrayed now kriemhild seeks revenge she marries hagen and through a series of events finally engages in a very drastic but fitting action at the end one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals attila the hun called etzel in the movie is shown as the strange person from the east possibly an allusion to the soviet union obviously it was not fritz lang s fault that hitler used the nibelungenlied for german national pride in the third reich but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story nonetheless this is an absolutely formidable movie

__label__1 yaitate japan is a really fun show and i really like it it was shown in our country just recently in hero tv and abs cbn every 5 30 it is about azuma kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream to make japanese bread that will represent his country he is working in the southern toyo branch of pantasia and he is also helping his friend tsukino azusagawa along with other bakers like kawachi kyousuke and kanmuri shigeru to beat st pierre and take control of pantasia they fight other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food it is a really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime like naruto detective conan and one piece and famous people from real life it is one of the best works of takashi haschiguchi and is really a must see for people of different ages 
__label__1 a lot of the comments people have made strike me as sorry missing the point kasdan wants to present life simply ordinary life the conventionally structured story where characters have insights that change their lives and then fade out music up and the film is over is absorbed into this much larger canvas several characters in this movie have just such illuminations and then they move on sometimes they can hold onto their insights sometimes they can t and that s the way life really is in other words kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life there is no happy ending only an eventual ending and everything before that is still in process still always up for grabs and if you absolutely insist on a theme an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives what is a miracle well life itself for a start then add in all the random incidents and cross connections that make up a life or several interconnected lives and you have miracles by the bucketful kasdan underscores this theme lightly rather than insisting on it and bolsters it in various ways most memorably by the device right in the center of the film of having mac and his wife lying in bed each dreaming their own dreams but as well showing later on in the film how those dreams have the power within the film to shape reality this is not a film with an easy or obvious message you just have to let it play out in front of you and then let it sit in your mind for a few days a month a few years and see what it has wrought there this is without a doubt kasdan s best film his most mature his most humane a major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors the tragedy is of course that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now mostly due to studio constraints around dreamcatcher hopefully we haven t heard the last from larry kasdan a great film from a great artist keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself completely in order to succeed 
__label__0 trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you ve heard about semi devout mormons and you ll see they ve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt hale s fortunes have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters the cinematography was amateurish i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didn t understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a 300 pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painful the only reason i didn t give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won t let me 
__label__1 there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairy tale like as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000 s as well as the 1990 s exciting hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro s especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish ten stars and not a decimal less 
__label__0 ben stiller doesn t so much act as react and he does it very well he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him in there s something about mary the stand up hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face when he confronts mary s other two suitors he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious in along came polly the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines of which there are too few having said that hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile noticeably through stiller s reaction however everyone seems to be acting in a bubble there is very little reaction hoffman and stiller s characters could have played off each other much much more aniston again reprises her rachael role but stiller is no ross it is more of a joey with a crush on rachael scenario polly is a by the numbers rom com and that is its failing it lacks heart you don t root for the characters with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story but in the end the film s failure comes down to poor writing worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night but you ll regret forking out cash to see it 
__label__1 bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940 s and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards you have got almost everything in this movie the scientist s assistants consist of an old hag a hunchback and dwarf her sons a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela s house bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie the corpse vanishes is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great fun rating 3 stars out of 5 
__label__1 ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces i found only the egyptian one disappointing stragely all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9 11 the afghan refugees deaf people palestinians the widows of srebrenica aids and poverty and corruption in africa pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath suicide bombings in israel paranoia hit and state persecuted muslim americans in the usa old people living alone and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers this might say something sad about the limits of empathy in both ways the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies while they effectively do the same with their short films surprising myself i found sean penn s piece one of the very best in the collection and spoiler ahead i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life s happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc collapsed out of light s way i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it 
__label__0 please spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a farrelly or a coen brother plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creek brand teen angst complete with a genxyz soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie feel cool and we have intensely and painfully inept satire this isn t even watered down ferris bueller i d rather watch a traffic light change only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission when the betty masked girls meet a richard nixon masked friend it s a surreal moment priceless even but for the rest of it i d rather have a toothache at least i can apply some benzocaine tm to stop the pain 
__label__0 i can t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it s his company but you re fired or you re hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve i d love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don t have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i d give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn t deserve that 
__label__1 this is the french and belgians doing what they do best it s quirky visually inventive exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling director jaco van dormael takes us into the world of georges a down s syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone just anyone this is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty georges interplay with corporate management guru harry is dazzlingly handled shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease the eighth day puts similar hollywood fare like barry levinson s oscar winning rain man or robert zemeckis s forrest gump well and truly in the shade at times it evokes the humour of milos forman s one flew over the cuckoo s nest with shades of dennis potter thrown in for good measure as the emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie harry daniel auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance but it is matched by the brilliant pascal duquenne as georges it s a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many memorable set pieces the shoe shop scene car showroom scene george s dance to genesis s jesus he knows me the conference scene the fireworks scene if you haven t seen it there s only one thing to do just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you ve been missing better still buy this movie sheer genius 
__label__0 this is the only movie that my wife and i have ever walked out on totally sucked we saw it in omaha even not funny at all looks like a 14 year old kid wrote the humor i can t believe these real politicians were actually in the movie awful

__label__0  baptists at our barbecue is the best film ever made now that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken let me begin my short overview of this tacky offensive pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie first of all the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by f mathew smith i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro mormon and sort of anti every other religion message yes the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists it shows all the main and role model characters being mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very judgmental baptists it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold hearted and ignorant baptists are instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic i m a part of neither religion i m actually an atheist but this offended me along with another countless amount of baptists most likely it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons and the mormons being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual like dislike between them sorry i didn t mean to go off on a rant another aspect of baptists at our barbecue i didn t much care for was the acting the performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead heather beers miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and i wasn t too much impressed with dan merkley who s the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but i have to say he s way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers whoever played the town sheriff was awful also although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clichés for example the main character tartan merkley finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life how cliché is that to make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché tartan buys the poor lonely heathen a puppy dog ugghhh if you want my advice stay as far away from baptists at our barbecue as you can i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion all i got was a well piece of crap grade d my ratings guide a absolutley flawless a a masterpiece near perfect a excellent b great b very good b good c a mixed bag c average c disappointing d bad d very bad d absolutley horrendous f not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces 
__label__0 interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be stocked besides the three part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s dont remember it you wont remember this one either in a year or two this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist s son you too can play high roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money 
__label__1 although i have not seen this mini series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between character plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions i ve seen were dubbed english and french but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of odysseus ever returning 
__label__1 though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven s style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can t be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste de grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you ll leave the cinema you ll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more 
__label__0 to be completely honest i haven t seen that many western films but i ve seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is western asia isn t where your going finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don t get me wrong i m not racist or white either so don t get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen 
__label__0 meet peter houseman rock star genetic professor at virgina university when he s not ballin on the court he s blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures dr houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal i d want to be immortal too if i looked like christian bale and got the sweet female lovin that only vu can offer an assortment of old and ugly university professors don t care for the popular houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum much to my amazement there are side effects and he get this metamorphoses into something that is embedded into our genetic dna that has been repressed for millions of years he also beds dr mike s crush sally after a whole day of knowing her she has a son his name is tommy he is an angry little boy metamorphosis isn t a terrible movie just not a well produced one the whole time i watched this i couldn t get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest it does not help that it s packaged along with 1970 s movies as metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment s 50 chilling classics there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually for me at least save the movie from a lower rating pay attention to the computer terminology such as cromosonic anomaly no wonder peter s experiment failed your computer can t spell this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern 
__label__1 a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store and picking stuff just because i haven t seen it a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones he made this better than average drama watching it you begin to notice how many decent good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large preferably large and unsubtle and scandalous kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director um no thanks his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot the plague is coming but here s an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope here s an almost watchable barabra bel geddes with her bathos turned way down well for her they re a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones here s an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew here s a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment these are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life something hollywood in its greed now studiously avoids these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them it s a personable human scaled film not the grotesque overscaled production that he and others david lean will later popularize whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge i just watched it twice and i ll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes but it doesn t seem that important to me as a viewer this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain and naked city which you should really get your hands on 
__label__0 the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady corbet says you ve blossomed near the end the film i practically died i m still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there was it supposed to create romance because it nearly made me sick the rest of the script was almost as bad i ve never liked the original thunderbirds but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much this movie doesn t if it didn t have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand it would have been shafted straight to tv or canned in the post production maybe even before like i said the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play busted s song thunderbirds are go i can t believe i wasted 7 watching this through pay per view 
__label__1 the ramones whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock lend their then unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan p j soles who faces off against a merciless joyless principal mary woronov for the right to rock featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution it s chock full of riotous sight gags like the mouse experiment teenage spirit probably my all time favorite film opening and bizarre off the wall moments the straitjacket scenes if you re looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level look no further but if you re looking for a nice dignified dramatic epic maybe you should look a wee bit further hi everybody i m riff randell and this is rock roll high school 
__label__1 intelligent wry and thrilling the invisible man stood out in 2000 among sci fi s usual lineup balancing out farscape s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue the show sat between law and order and doctor who on the believability meter but there was no denying the fact that i man s characters went beyond caricature even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper the official and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic paul ben victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable the show s low points are still entertaining and i ve never seen such taut pilot episodes matt greenberg and sci fi should be commended and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show every time i come across a marathon of hercules the legendary journeys on sci fi i roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that invisible man and its ilk represented 
__label__0 the film school intellects can drool all they want about the important imagined meaning of this film but it s just that intellectual drool this film is creatively bankrupt and some mistake it s endless self indulgent wanking as substance yeah obviously godard wasn t a stones fan too bad because this could have been great he s capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective mag or some such crap then there s the endless shots of what looks like 60 s librarians spray painting words on people s cars and then there s the seemingly neverending interview where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions there s some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book which goes on for oh only about 20 minutes and black panthers or something in a junkyard it almost sounds intriguing well it s not but for unwashed film school hipsters who don t care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag s this film s a real winner more accurately maybe godard just blows 
__label__0 i wasn t at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knock offs are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7 foot leather aproned butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater doubling as a hideout for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have differed greatly unfortunately most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge type scenario so basically it is just a low budget hostel rip off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say don t bother with this one 
__label__0 baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of time the sound fx do not sound real they stick out way too much technical gadgets etc if they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps because those gadgets don t really make loud sounds like that natural sounds like footsteps and such are non existent which gives it a void like atmosphere directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film i sure hope it was a low budget production although it does seem fairly amateurish at times most characters seem empty and false they simply haven t casted this movie very well i d imagine it would ve been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used i mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent it s should ve a long ago buried corpse in movie production the production team ever heard of subtitles this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless i mean if the plot again goes like the interpol can t do jack so let s call one american to bring down this international syndicate or whatever sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it i d imagine them to have some self respect also are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year maybe they should ve used the same team as who were making di que si say i do it s spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat looks and sounds much better come on sony wake up produce less sell more 
__label__1 two warring shop workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box number aliases within this simple idea and an everyday setting lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit drama poignancy and irony that never lets up stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions and the rest of the well developed characters have their own sub plots and in jokes although wrongly eclipsed by stewart s big films of 39 40 destry philadelphia story mr smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films 
__label__1 going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea especially a romantic fantasy little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike stardust is the way to go 
__label__0 don t understand how these animated movies keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it is people love it i saw this movie with my two kids 5 7 they like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film the theater was almost full and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast to tell the truth i was bored silly it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just didn t work my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie but not on this one my daughter fell asleep half way through also the kids thought the character animation looked weird i haven t heard that from them since seeing the polar express which gave my daughter nightmares trust me i m not the type who looks for the negative in everything but quality is quality and like so many animated movies they throw out there it has very little 
__label__0 i sat through this turkey because i hadn t seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence at the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving in fact when the characters move outside the house bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops at that point whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film too bad all hurricanes aren t like this one it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state 
__label__0  nobody knows anybody is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week he also happens to be the best friend of the film s hero the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game with himself and the hero as players and seville as the virtual environment the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman type games looked at this way the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays from the start we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game the hero s job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend s father clues are liberally scattered as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant e g the advert in the bar the detective paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress rather than an investigation after the fact the film borrows heavily on se7en s pattern narrative and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter in this reading the game is on the level of narrative with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case the computer to win and save the day but there is a second game the film itself which subvert the first there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer s intentions but the filmmaker s and his hero s in the first ten minutes there are references to chess a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin if we remember that the chess loving nabokov s 1930s pseudonym was sirin we see another game afoot one where we suspect not the villain but the hero himself in a nabokov novel like pale fire an author figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted e g the image contracting or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero s point of view the opening references to games are all linked to him in the early sequences much is made of the character s sexual and creative impotence so the film could be his attempt to master his life to be a winner in a way he can t for real no sooner has he won the game than his writer s block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film suggesting he is the overall author further that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero like kinbote trapped in his own solecism this jumble of post modern literature borges eco pynchon et al are alluded to also fincher x files run lola run chris marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present bunuellian anti clericism and alex de la iglesia s shock films result in a film that is just that a jumble each clever clever allusive element cancelling out the last dissipating interest the lack of clarity about the game s rules renders it incomprehensible and eventually wearing ironically in a work of such overdetermined artifice the film s main interest lies in its documentary quality as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like sans soleil or london but ultimately you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness 
__label__0 if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr then this is the film for you if not then choose another dvd from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g s and a key bloody streetz and menace i would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot editing and acting really don t matter to you it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity 
__label__0 sholay considered to be one of the greatest films i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is that was the time rgv announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie but every week we would here rgv change something and the movie is a very b grade movie something that i had not hoped i really tried looking for positives but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind the cinematography is awesome the movie tries to be its own but that is the up side the action sequences are weak the screenplay had potential the biggest flaw is editing none of the scenes excite you for example the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original and none of the characters are developed and no scenes will linger until the end and the ending was very disappointing the biggest question is acting amitabh bachchan was good as gabbar singh nothing great it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look that the character only looks menacing but you don t get creeped out mohanlal is barely in the movie but he impresses in his few scenes ajay devgan was decent it wasn t so much the performance he gave it his all it was the weak script prashant raj is very confident and has potential to make it far with better movies i had most expectations for sushmita sen who was probably the best of the lot she was expressive but this still was not enough nisha kothari surprised me she seemed disinterested for the most part but her emotional scene after her friend s death was quite good seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent not her cute looks but what disappointed me most was chemistry ajay devgan and prashant raj didn t look like friends ajay nisha were not a strong couple no passion was to be found between sushmita and prashant and amitabh and mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed as for songs they pretty much suck urmila s mehbooba was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it it was however nicely danced the holi number was enjoyable but not memorable same went for the other songs for someone who looked forward to this movie i was heavily disappointed i had high hopes for rgv because of his jungle but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie but hopefully he regains his talent for sarkar raj but this movie is best forgotten all the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is 
__label__0 hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i ve ever seen i m never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don t really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can t remember anyway

__label__1 i couldn t believe the comments made about the movie as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i did what i viewed was incredible i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie i hadn t had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldn t have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i d have to say its the most believable movie that i ve seen in a long time what i don t see is why everyone has such a problem with deanna s choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice that i don t understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great roles busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her you go girl 
__label__0 i actually saw china o brien ii before i ever saw the original china o brien and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse but worse funnier and funnier better if you re a bad movie fan like i am this is great material if however you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot acting ability or movie making skill this is best avoided the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast forward hilariously bad see it for a laugh see it for mindless entertainment but whatever you do see it for free on tv 
__label__0 i ll be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it s in the imdb bottom 100 and right now i m wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another check on that same list van damme is luc deveraux who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a hal to defend itself and yes after all the obligate explosions shoot outs and chases he is the last one standing combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set up it makes sure it s place in the infamous list is just only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list 2 10 
__label__1 im gonna make this short and sweet because i don t think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique for me its possibly the funniest show ever you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out for example the way hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes its all round classic i mean the cast the writers the director its just a recipe for success one actor i think who always gets a hard time is ashton kutcher but i mean he s great in this show i don t think its possible for the the character kelso to have been played by anyone else it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid all the main characters are great and it wouldn t be a worth while review if i didn t mention the stone cold fox mila kunis now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show 
__label__1 nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci fi movie that s been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russell s career i have my reasons firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of russell s interpretation of todd the eponymous soldier i m going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i ve seen russell pull off todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now the portrayal is spot on todd is withdrawn uncommunicative and a loner he suffers from irrational anxiety keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger his hyper focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed not cleaning up the cut or the blood many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he s preparing and the food that will be eaten later todd s dialog is spartan to say the least the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence fear and discipline we are told always fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform tactically the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsen s sandra but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who s only experience of an embrace is in combat the trembling represents him suppressing his fight flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled his movement and vision restricted fear and discipline indeed then there is the subtext of his abandonment twice in fact so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they ve served their terms 40 of the unemployed are ex military in our world in his it can only be worse russell quickly picks up the mantle of mace s responsibility to his wife and child desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high likelihood of his death then there is the military subtext too the conflict between busey s church and the hotshot from hq mekum mekum s new men are faster stronger more accurate and aggressive any one of them could pound todd into the ground but it s not about the tools you have it s how you use them an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit sent in without support cover or reconnaissance it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership there are many other subtle themes when a film is shot and scripted so minimally it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you 
__label__1 even 15 years after the end of the vietnam war jacknife came not too late or was even superfluous it s one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war the time after different from movies like taxi driver or rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship jacknife might be the quietest vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified moreover it can make us believe that the war has not finished yet at least for some of us the three main characters are amazing de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie possibly this was his best performance ever 
__label__1 this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie it s a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone 
__label__0 it s nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president truman s ordered us forces into the korean war starlift you see is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea but you d need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name korea mentioned we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there s no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute america s men in uniform released in december 1951 by warner brothers starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio s star studded world war two home front morale booster hollywood canteen this 1944 crowd pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract from joan crawford john garfield and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre bette davis sydney greenstreet and more starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne a mask like janice rule and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops but in place of crawford garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day ruth roman gordon macrae virginia mayo gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney randolph scott and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper this threadbare cast whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp is perfectly matched by the crummy production values presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection how bad is it you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage to describe starlift as a sloppy lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy lazy and third rate it s just terrible avoid it

__label__1 this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot there s not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice overs describing their experience why they participated etc it s a document it s mind blowing i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this nb the producer doesn t have the rights to distribute a dvd version i ve also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr boerner and order a copy on vhs :)
__label__0 well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today what a major disappointment 1 if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u s military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are they mirrored my own thoughts as the movie played i a complete civilian kept thinking to myself say what there s no way that would happen like that 2 there s very little that actually happens in terms of plot a new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed a death that isn t really clearly explained the new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work his attitude puts others at risk that s it 3 this movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed if you want suspense try one of the bourne movies if you want to see a war movie that s emotionally powerful try renting go tell the spartans which is about the vietnam war and stars burt lancaster who told me personally in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over hyped apocalypse now or an old wwii black and white classic sink the bismark which especially for an english film is unbelievably heart wrenching don t waste your time on hurt locker

__label__0 this movie is a waste of film stock do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see it happened in this film do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a negro unit cooking supply services burial detail etc it happened in this film do you believe that a black and supposedly intelligent officer would select this same deaf k p to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived it happened in this film would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn t realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him it happened in this film would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50 away they did it in this film and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected would you believe that over the airwaves and in clear english the captain mentioned the general s rank if not his name as the person he was speaking with and that the general in plain english over open airwaves said that the dam had to be protected the next day maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans this so called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films if it were i m sure it would do well watch it at your own risk 
__label__1 i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival where i went when i was in hollywood that this film was in screening basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this the struggle is between candidates lam lok simon yam and big d tony leung ka fai for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society also starring louis koo as jimmy lee nick cheung as jet cheung siu fai as mr so lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments just about enough action apart from maybe when the cops get involved but a sequel followed so it s a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller very good 
__label__1 i read schneebaum s book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60 s but his honesty and openness about it were welcome this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness 
__label__0 this is just a butchering of a wonderful story by edwin torres this movie doesn t follow the storyline in the book and there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had even seen the first movie al pacino the original and still the best carlito gets out of prison at the start of the original one here carlito retires with his woman in paradise what happened to gail from lorain ohio in this installment she isn t mentioned and carlito retires with and presumably will marry some other girl also where is kleinfeld i think he was in the first book i also like how mr guzman plays a totally different character in this film he was pachanga back in the pacino days now he is nacho reyes a killer from cuba i remember that nacho reyes had a much bigger role in the book it s been a while since i read the book but where did sean comb s character come from also i think this movie really glosses over the racial tensions in harlem that torres was writing about and the mob doesn t get the treatment that they did in the book they are also wiped out in this movie but magically the pleasant avenue bunch is around for the second movie the book told a great story this movie could have told a great story this is just a huge disappointment read the book it s a better use of your time 
__label__1 in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted s excellent adventure bill and ted are under threat from the future as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted in order to change the future in a great comedy pairing winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel though lacking the sharpness of the first bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth the grim reaper watch for the games sequences the best moment in the entire film but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre though still packed with humour this film has a more dramatic film towards it with stakes being more serious and situations more risky this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present as is evident in the final couple of scenes the first watch i hated this sequel but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more and though the jokes and plot aren t as strong as its predecessor bogus journey has enough feel good motives jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film 
__label__0 i ll admit that i liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequel i was let down sure the special effects were technically amazing but they weren t believable looking it looked more like a cartoon alright i admit to liking 80 of the chase scene but the fight with all the mr smiths it was too obviously animated i can accept all of that what i can t accept is that the non action parts were crap every time morpheus opened his mouth i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie except about the existence of the matrix this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream ugh i want my 7 00 back 
__label__0 i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie it s not bad enough to be hilarious there s no sleaze or gratuitous nudity although there was plenty of opportunity there s no gore there s no suspense in the first hour of the movie cause there s way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music that last part was actually funny on many occasions you see these natives hitting congas and jembés and that s indeed what you hear badly synchronized on the soundtrack but they also added this funky bass line on the soundtrack so where was the bass player at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists why all of the sudden it s supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river alligator god i actually missed the explanation for that one but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden angriness and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water it s all silly and pointless this movie also features the skinniest afro american model i ve ever seen at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives the only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killer crocodile is actually an alligator crocodile or alligator what s the difference it s big it s made out of plastic and it eats people all the same to me the alligator is a rather silly creation it s very stiff motionless and doesn t even flap its feet when it swims the eyes don t even move when they re shot in close up i guess they didn t know animatronics back then in italy during 1979 there s also a lot of pointless inter cut shots of the local wildlife i suspect it s stock footage like i said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didn t switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didn t want to wake the sweet thing but the last half hour of the movie did get better we finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them the most entertaining and at the same time funny scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses we re looking at a matchbox version of the van falling in the river here funny but nicely shot in fact there are several other nice traveling camera moves surprisingly for this type of flick i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but i don t wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie my advice is to stay away from it if you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see lewis teague s alligator i admit that one isn t italian and isn t a jaws rip off but it certainly is more fun and if you re interested in other movies made by director sergio martino then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019 after the fall of new york that one s an over the top rip off of every possible existing post apocalyptic future of doom movie italians and rip offs two words that go together very well 
__label__1 i love this movie purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember prince is so tight in this movie i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued it is really one of the greatest movies of all time the music is untouchable the movie is about the kid played by prince his family is dysfunctional his band is the hottest act in town and he has his eyes on the apollonia an aspiring singer there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank the kid for that so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap this is a classic 4ever 
__label__1 grand epic as it is kenneth branagh s monumental rendering of what is perhaps william shakespeare s most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making while i absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such i must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric and he sends himself up so well and his many flourishes thus hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip from patrick doyle s music to alex thomson s cinematography to tim harvey s exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing his adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of hamlet the strain seemed to be showing yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role derek jacobi gobbles up the sinister claudius with glee and julie christie is most dramatic as his queen gertrude richard briers is marvellous as polonius and charlton heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player king many others drop by including jack lemmon superb in a very small role billy crystal dame judi dench sir john mills sir john gielgud sir richard attenborough and gerard depardieu the acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years kate winslet hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair ophelia to finish before this review goes on longer than the film i must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes too many of them outstay their welcome watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it neither a lender nor a borrower be or be true to thyself and of course to be or not to be the opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward monday june 8 1998 hoyts croydon
__label__0 i don t give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi monde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene while the acting and plot can t be said to be well done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective she s interesting though not necessarily convincing highlights the film s use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey 
__label__1 short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious with exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu l ami farewell friend i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical he man superstars alain delon and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a for the time ultra modern glass and aluminum tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie perhaps a subtle kind of product placement i can recommend this movie for the actor s performances alone delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of acrobatics i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors bernard fresson who was gene hackman s partner in french connection ii he is the best brainy police inspector i know also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingénue who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seems anyone who expects the old in an out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake 
__label__1 ride with the devil has something rich and special if you can stand the slow development while tackling a dark gritty subject the brutal guerrilla war in the american west during its civil war which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s the movie maintains a strangely satisfying unmanipulated atmosphere what i m refering to is the tendency of films music and lighting to make you feel the mood you d expect to feel but rwtd instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer s senses as an enthusast of this particular area of cw history i m greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film the diologue is expertly written even with subtle humor occasionally with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles independence for example a far cry from the oregon trail the minor events that occur to jake s band are similar to actual events that took place especially the attack when they re holed up in the house and the destruction of the store booth the battle scenes though rare are pretty well executed it even has the first cw cavalry battle put on film recently the directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways example the character of black john is shown taunting a lawrence resident during the massacre where s your army who are we to fight who are we to fight the shot then switches to a trio of confederate regulars standing doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues you are cowards all who are the cowards really little touches like that really enhance the movie s quality there are no major glaring areas in the history something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don t add up but you will never notice that a larger curiosity is the fact that the only african american man at arms character in the film is the quasi slave fighting for jake and his confederate bushwhackers it is true that some blacks did fight for the confederacy out there including one who scouted lawrence for quantrill before the attack who would suspect him though this black rebel is a fasinating character whatever pc african americans might think of him not a single black union infantryman is seen in the film which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the western cw one of the first black regiments of the cw was raised in kansas by the murderer senator jim lane and before the 54th mass reg of fame was organized and black troops in such battles as baxter springs ks played a critical role no glaring historical errors good realistic action which is infrequent and not gratitous good directing this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were but it s the cleanest job of any 
__label__0 this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded the acting was horrible too the camera work wasn t bad but that still couldn t redeem it the writer director of this film must suffer from down s syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the kris kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled disappearances i don t know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least 20 for my time pain and suffering in conclusion the director writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street 
__label__0 a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante their previous collaboration on the first season s homecoming was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered the supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial cleaning of the planet of it s human infestation why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king s the stand instead of having the male population butcher the females i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it i like a lot of both dante and hamm s work but this was just unwatchable 
__label__0 this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever i m so sorry i describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together e g kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own then there s the cop who is slightly weird and perverted then the drug addict then there s the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth even that did not make me like this film hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do boycott cabin fever 2 
__label__0 this one of the best celebrity s reality shows a ever saw we can see the concerts we can see the life of britney i love the five episodes i was always being surprised by britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people don t watch the show at all we can how a great person she his she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work i just don t give a 10 because of k fed he his a real jerk he doesn t seem to like britney at all i they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how britney really is go britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts 
__label__1 dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation while the first part acts 1 and 2 mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part acts 3 and 4 i do have some complaints though in the first part the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool buaku rules 
__label__1 antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece this time on the other side of the atlantic than blow up it wasn t the success with critics and youth like the former though why maybe because it was a european s view of america filled with clichés that didn t work then and that have not aged well the revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing maybe when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated if it had been released a year before maybe hippes in deserts would have seemed fresh it s a very interesting film tho very beautifully shot with some brilliant and antonionian scenes in between like the love making in the desert the stillness of the desert mansion and the explosive ending that the leads were two amateurs didn t help they were beautiful but inexperienced mark freshette is slightly better than daria halprin it would have been so much better with proper actors maybe michelle phillips or a young jessica lange the dialog is actually quite funny and poignant at times tho you wouldn t know the way the lines are delivered a very intersting document of the late sixties definitely worth a look for the photography and the soundtrack 
__label__1 i had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back so when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay for view channel i was intrigued i wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for vietnam i went out and rented this movie and i have to say it is the most heart wrenching film i have ever seen i bought the dvd immediately after renting it the way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something i ve never experienced with any other film as far as vietnam subject films go i think it is the best one although platoon runs a close second besides all of that i think it is also colin farrell s best performance as an actor i like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible i gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies 
__label__0 a group of human looking aliens going to earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and act retarded padded with footage from planet of the dinosuars and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss the acting is atrocious as well and while this isn t as bad as chickboxer what movie can be this is still pretty awful repugnant stuff it s 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on skip this crappy film there s nothing to see here the film makers try to resell this turd as a mst3k style making fun of the movie they made a decade before and it works to an extent it s still nothing that watchable though ariauna albright is hot but lilith stabs has a pretty unattractive speaking voice my grade d dvd extras joke commentary 17 behind the scenes featurette 7 minute into the black featurette jessica mills reporting stills gallery and original trailer
__label__0 wow the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists i know a lot of those the guys that ll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror this movie is utter crap it looks and sounds like a porno good lord the soundtrack is awful and has sub par porn acting which is shocking because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this most likely beans beans beans until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever when they could have had a very interesting central theme how do religious zealot anti abortionists feel when it s the devil s baby but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed it s just awful like plan 9 from outerspace awful like good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode 
__label__0 warning possible spoilers not that you should care also sorry for the caps starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that s all the more annoying for talking nonsense it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama that s badly but accurately put we know space travel is a risky enterprise there s a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions radiation stress related symptoms etc and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments they knew stuff could go wrong in fact stuff had gone wrong it s called learning granted appollo 11 wasn t safe by today s standards and there was immense political pressure but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive assorted mistakes comments i hadn t even to look up 1 nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong well duh that s what i would ve done it was the apex of a propaganda war after all 2 nasa gives green light despite the fact that appollo 11 will probably blow up this is only implicit though yeah that s why they let people and press watch in almost real time 3 the capsule ejection wouldn t work like it didn t work the time a chimp was in it the one that survived it was a test launch and the rocket exploded the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute there s a video of it you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere 4 one interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of florida i can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole cause if not i m just aghast how he could get it so wrong 5 the technology then was primitive compared to today s standards actually relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today the reason being that it must not crash it s even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren t that susceptible to radiation and the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway so a complex steering system like the b2 s wouldn t do what s with the fact that they were using tv screens rather than computer screens it s the same damn technology actually tv monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition 6 if that object wasn t part of the rocket it could be only one thing we see where this is going apart from the fact that the statement is wrong who says it wasn t a rocket part at least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don t know what it is it s by definition an unidentified flying object 7 the voice over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander s radiation foil was actually its hull which would make it thinner than a space suit 8 neil armstrong s near death during a practice flight is footage i can appreciate i hadn t seen it before as i said any piece of manifest technology can go wrong especially if it s not been tested sufficiently on account of being you know unprecedented 9 the trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander due to irregularities in the moon s density was at no time acutely life threatening neither was the fifteen seconds of fuel left which was in fact fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module 10 a catastrophic chain of events usually results in catastrophe i really don t know how to put it any simpler this however is a prime example of the rhetoric used 11 there s a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid followed by the voice over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed turns out he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid hilarious stuff 12 it s mentioned that during re entry all contact was lost this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it s impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology again the gravity of this is implicit but very purposely so 13 there was never a shuttle lost in space itself while the voice over presents this fact as evidence that appollo 11 was a pile of crap appollo 13 was a near loss but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re entry respectively in any case comparing shuttles to saturn rockets is somehow well okay just plain stupid even ignoring that the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience 14 what the hell s up with the ufo even in the context of the movie it makes no sense unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes aimed at a specific audience which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history science or rhetorics even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure catch phrases like covered up until now publically revealed here for the first time come up but the film doesn t place any blame or offer a lesson or anything which could be expected of a film so emotionally done in the good old tradition of sensationalism there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except nasa scientist wow so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor fancy that what does this have to do with the point of the movie again oh yeah which point in summary in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate it s not even good entertainment and believe me i m a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries this film isn t funny witty quaint it s nothing 
__label__0 this is an extremely boring film if you grew up during the vietnam was as i did then you ve seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation if you re old enough to remember vietnam then you won t find anything new here there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler s excellent film going upriver stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal 
__label__1 i don t watch a lot of tv except for the office weeds entourage and e s soup i think i hold this show in good company i love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a sanjaya or heidi montag sp the best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments c mon most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the auditions which is why most people claim to watch and that means i don t have to suffer through the other 98 of these mind numbing talk shows or reality shows for one nugget of funny or shock the only reason why soup doesn t get a 10 in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny and on an even rarer occasion the commentary isn t always up to par but they can t all be home runs either if so soup wouldn t be on e joel s quick wit and soup s writing team which includes mchale make for a great show i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off camera even when they re being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs it s hilarious because it is forced they re obviously being ironic and that s part of what makes this show funny 
__label__1 i haven t always been a fan but the show grew on me it wasn t until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show they finally brought daniel jackson s search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go ould system lords were killed by rival lords sg 1 or others towards season 5 stargate sg 1 was beginning to become stale with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise the show became more and more solid the characters had become stale as well colonel jack o neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o neill s weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go ould ra the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself only allowing his close friends in amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter she was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job though this character had little area to grow tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter s strengths she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal c teal c was an alien called the jaffa infant go ould snake like creatures would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form the jaffa would die teal c was the first prime of apophis army knowing that apophis was not a god like go ould pretend he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy finally having had enough he and jack o neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people after arriving on earth he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the go ould christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character teal c is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra tac the show would not be complete without master bra tac played by tony amandola he is also a rock in the end he became adviser to most of sg 1 especially daniel jackson don s davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal he does his job has a wife sons and daughters and grandchildren you can really say he is the anchor of the base simply i would die for that man if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world he will go himself he doesn t leave anyone behind i saved dr daniel jackson for last because this character i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on in choosing shanks i don t think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson they don t talk about spader they talk about shanks in the early years the jackson character came off as a whiner that s why i probably wasn t a fan as the seasons pasted the character became stronger this gave him confidence in the end as of season 10 the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero he still monitors the groups ethics he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward acheaology history culture and exploration are part of his very being he is determined though a man of peace he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement other characters include most recently vala mal doran claudia black and colonel cameron mitchell ben browder new lead of sg 1 both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess i see little difference between mitchell and crichton farscape character black s character is simply off the wall definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon 
__label__1 such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow up should be it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of australian history legend and horses the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism the plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry the lead cast from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton and a well replaced brian dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film as far as sequels can go the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again 
__label__1 indian summer is a good film it made me feel good and i thought the cast was exceptional how about sam raimi playing the camp buffoon i thought his scenes were very funny in a buster keaton like performance solid directing and nice cinematography 
__label__0 if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the street the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without him by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake 
__label__1 with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn t trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 9 10 
__label__0 they sell it as a horror movie it s supposed to be a thriller but i found it pretty funny comedy don t think so i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot i don t blame the actors i think they were not very good but o k i think cillian is a very good bad guy i loved his acting in batman beggins and rachel mcadams whoa she s a beauty and a good actress as well but let s try to be a little objective here the story mm mm the direction mm mm it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie but there s one good thing tho it s a short movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes for me it was like 10 minutes under the water i just don t know why this movie is rated so high and in rotten tomatoes even higher what s wrong with good rational and objective criticism 
__label__1 from the opening shots of the lead actor we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of normal life eric lartigau the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives yet without the help support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work the use of facial image throughout the film is superb and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family mother is spot on while there are more than enough laughs in the movie it still deals with single parents adoption and the strength of family in society truly rewarding to watch and again one that only the french seam capable to make so far one of the best 50 or so films i have seen this year and well worth a five start rating i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages 
__label__0 how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time by the worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because it s so bad it s good an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band wagon syndrome let s bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we d cite the film s universal poor quality goes without saying sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesn t allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film s poorness that that s a task not worth pursuing my impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobson s sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin chuckle moments all i m sure none intentional spiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad it s good no it had just enough i can t believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing more definitely a film to watch with a group of bad movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that would ve significantly improved the experience for me so bad it s mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey 
__label__1 i think the weighted average for this film is too low i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places my wife says it passes the danielle steele test superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell 
__label__1 the haunted world of edward d wood jr isn t a particularly good documentary aesthetically it s lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in cohesive but this adds to it s charm i say this because it s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such there s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall it s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but don t expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after wood s own heart 
__label__1 this splendidly directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm it is a first class adventure for many reasons i suggest fine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good simulated jungle locales and a very exciting storyline johnny weissmuller plays tarzan a mono syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs creation but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative as jane parker his wife who had been jane porter in the novels maureen o sullivan is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality the effect of the lighting the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back lot which really works the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed but into their idyll come people searching from them emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated one is harry holt still in love with her who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him the gown and perfumes interest her but she refuses to leave tarzan tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a humanized king king the group claim to want to hunt animals and tarzan agrees for jane s sake to a bit of big game trapping but at some point the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition s heads minds tarzan is shot left for dead and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous elephant s graveyard but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call in a most spectacular elephant filled scene he saves jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little richer but much wise as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband the film was directed by set design wizard cedric gibbons and quite beautifully too his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish neil hamilton is a very good harry paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally an unusual and well realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well recommended

__label__0 as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly aren t so many that i want to discourage film makers from a genre that s woefully under exploited still i must honestly say that love s abiding joy is a typically low budget low key self consciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre i m being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys you ve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration 
__label__0  there are spoilers homicidal nymphomaniac hooker miya kari wuhrer takes over the life and car of 18 virgin even though he s too embarrassed to admit it collage freshmen trent colbert kristoffer ryan by the end of the movie myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him or her in order to keep from ending up turning into one hanging around a trucker rest stop miya is picked up by roy burt young for some hot and heavy action in the back seat of his buggy roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that miya is non other then his estranged daughter outraged that miya is reluctant to get it on with him roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student trent colbert who plows into the rest area side swiping one of the truckers seeing her chance miya jumps into trent s car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie going all across the north eastern usa the two end up involved in a truck car smash up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to trent s parents home with them being held hostage it s there that there s another wild shootout between the crazed miya with an entire swat team reinforced by the local police and state troopers you would expect a movie like hit and run to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but it s not in fact the film is very disturbing in how miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child molesting father roy getting trent to drive her all over the north east miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny mr foster by tricking him into giving her his gun as being part of some weird sex game after holding foster up she takes off with trent s who out cold in his motel room wallet with some 400 00 in it yet doesn t bother to drive away with his car needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for thanksgiving trent gets a call on his cellphone from miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back like the jerk that he is trent picks up miya who s now a fugitive from he law and later gets involved with her father roy on the open highway as he tries to run both trent miya off the road the chase ends up in this deserted wear house that roy chases miya out running him on a muddy road in high heels into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended with both a holdup and murder as well as a hit and run charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a s m tattoo boutique where trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains by myri together with a matching his and hers dog collar this in order to meet his straight laced and conservative parents for thanksgiving dinner having a running shootout with the state troopers with one of them ending up badly injured the two fugitives from the law end up at trent s parents mr mrs colbet david keith elaine martyn home with the entire local police force with a swat team waiting for them there obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying if at all to tell it s audience you felt a lot of sympathy for miya at first but as the movie rolled along to it s downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in death valley even though roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended miya totally eclipsed him 
__label__1 ten years after the first movie james belushi one of the most gifted and over looked light comedic actors of the last twenty years returns as detective dooley for this movie if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie you will be disappointed but this is still a good movie realizing that all the dog vs man battle of wills scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with dooley s recently deceased wife after she rejected his book and blames dooley for her death the script may not be the best but the movie allows both belushi and christine tucci to show their good acting ability while still retaining enough of the light humour of the first movie to make it work and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see an easy light going movie which while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or belushi definately worth a watch when it comes on tv 
__label__1 spoiler alert i had just watched the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks though i did like the extended version i wish they would have left the original version on the dvd the portabello road could have been cut down to the orginal length it was too long and dragged the movie along though the dancing is great would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted scene all in all this is a great movie my 5 year old liked it and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation this and mary poppins are added to my collection just as i had remembered out of 
__label__1 there s a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship stuff he dare not dream about as doctor edward morbius pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter anne francis they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin the machinery they left behind is still functioning maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it s as fresh as it was in 1956 the terms would change we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey it s interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one about mortal beings trying to play god you can t write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot this mechanical marvel put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl s request for some home spirits are very funny robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea forbidden planet s bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b demille classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare s one venture into science fiction my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who s sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he s dealing with never miss this one whenever it s broadcast 
__label__1 i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story the acting by nolte lee arkin and the supporting cast was superb the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details 
__label__1 throughly enjoy all the musical numbers each time i see this movie never seem to tire of it fred and ginger are always a pleasure to watch seeing lucy and betty grable before they hit the big time is fun to watch 
__label__0 although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered monument valley i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first she s in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails then she s back again then deserts them again then she s back again there s no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one searchers 2 0 is no match for the searchers 
__label__0 bradford dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene having partial amnesia or global amnesia which one character claims to define as elective loss of memory the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hopes of piecing his life back together abhorrent concoction very loosely based on walter ericson s book fallen angel filmed in 1965 as mirage with gregory peck it was probably too racy for television what with drugs and hippies added to the mix that nbc initially refused to air it which is how this low budgeter wound up in theaters director james goldstone gets freaky with the hyperkinetic visuals and camera tricks while editor edward a biery goes wild with the zig zag cuts unfortunately their admittedly colorful gimmicks cannot cover up the weaknesses of this updated plot and the acting is woefully overripe dillman under pressure to recall the events of the night in question goes through an actor s seminar of tics stammers nose wipes and crazy half laughs while spitting out dialogue like dream a dream drugs yeah drugs that sound bells help as a villainous fellow scientist with a cheshire cat smile pat hingle nearly upstages dillman in the grand thespian department by continually addressing everyone in baby talk strutting about like a middle aged peacock and twisting his mouth around in agony hope lange s scientist love interest is given the short shrift but not before she screams at indifferent lover dillman what do i have to do talk ape man me want you this is one frantic jigsaw 1 2 from 
__label__1 alivealive is a very entertaining sci fi movie from japan i have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved versus this director s debut film or his third film azumi i have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies frankly i went to the video store to get versus but i am just fine with alive if you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then alive is not your pick there is plenty of action however it comes as pay off for a whole hour of character driven build up personally i think it is well done and worth it of course some of the plot is silly as with many sci fi action films and i think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect this film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply they kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building taking a cue from the cube but the film doesn t suffer for it another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream sequences rent this 
__label__0 this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed the effects were pretty good i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money i rented it so i won t complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that i ll never get back plot holes abound terrible acting all across the board i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short if your friends want to watch this run away i can t stress enough how bad this film was where the hell did the second dragon come from why didn t he show up sooner how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago 
__label__0 alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test i won t mince words this movie was bad the story was bad the acting was bad the always wonderful sissy spacek did nothing to make this movie better indeed i asked myself why did i even bother to see this rotten trashy movie why did i waste my time and money on something that i suspected would be bad the answer is of course that i am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided i will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it politely subpaar a serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie otherwise stay home don t waste your time read a book take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich 
__label__0 as you may or may not have heard there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing but really it s kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either there was absolutely no story or plot just things happening the acting was incredibly bad worse than safeauto commercials bad not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer i m not kidding but they used chainsaw sound effects this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i ve ever seen in my life the only circumstance that i wouldn t totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old s really though even with all of the criticism i offer here i d suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever and because of this is quite comical even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained 
__label__0 the prophecy ii what s there to say about it they ve completely abandoned the originality of the first film and simply made a chris walken splatter film it s not even written by the original writer if you ve seen nr 1 don t watch nr 2 it s a real disappointment if you haven t seen nr 1 don t watch nr 2 go see nr 1 to experience something original and fun
__label__1 the 14 year old in me is immensely happy that they re now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that they re all the rage what with lord of the rings harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office this year will see and already has seen several more most notably the golden compass which has the most exciting trailer i ve seen this year stardust based on a novel by neil gaiman showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep i saw no previews for it only a couple of commercials the critical reaction is kind of blah i wouldn t even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend well if you ll forgive the horrible pun the stars must have been rightly aligned because i went to see stardust and i loved it it s not a huge movie like lord of the rings the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest the hero sets out to look for a fallen star filled with obstacles but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative it s simply aiming to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance and it succeeds wonderfully there were a lot of big films this summer but none of them were nearly as fun as this one there s a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent it isn t a masterpiece but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has though i don t like it quite as much as the earlier film a lot of fun to be had here if you re a fan of the genre 
__label__0 considering its pedigree this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is even with a lip smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together lemmon lanchester kovacs and gingold the entire event is dully paced drearily shot and more often than not witless kim novak s gifts were not essentially comic as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid james stewart was a fine comedian as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does except maybe the cat 
__label__1 this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger hidden dragon the movie is a unique combination of several genres it s a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this this movie definitely makes it to my top 5 and should be enjoyable to every movie lover the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way it s shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ghosts can fly see this movie you won t regret it 10 10
__label__1 tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy after his great fist movie called el fondo del mar and the spectacular tv pro gramme los simuladores damian szifron made another great work tiempo de valientes looks for moments a movie made in hollywood diego peretti and luis luque are two great actors and here they have great performances the movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that i totally recommend if you wanna have a great time and i have to congrats szifron for all the talent he has rating 9
__label__0 this movie is so aggrivating the main character looks like he s 35 and i ve seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor also some of the worst dialogue i ve heard in 3 years lets go find a small animal to torture ugh i can t even continue don t watch this pile of garbage it was made in 8 days the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures 2 out of 10 unwatchable
__label__0 i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don t remember or possibly blocked them out who knows if i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye 
__label__1 well this was one of those films i caught on the off chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many 80 s horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm i e not just another glut of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldn t go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess i d give it 6 5 out of 10 
__label__1 my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i can t summarize the plot but it s a really superb character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom trebor unwittingly gets his new heart it d been my last film in a long long day halfway through the festival maybe i d dozed the better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming don t know did know there was an o henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished and knew it had to do with the heart hence the quietly hilarious talent search my plot loss remark had more to do with intricacies of trebor s connections in france his relation to the dog woman and so on stuff i d been wide awake for denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director s treatment but i write these things too often from memory especially festival films films whose dvd i don t have at hand le lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions still or already l inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark side superman a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible relatively soft spoken driven but patient right among us the scar once he attains it makes him just visually i mean in image a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster mad doctor and creation all in one the actual doctors are his tools if he doesn t extract and install the heart himself it s only because it s not possible he s the force always the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself what else is he to suggest that he s us the first world versus the third seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow first worlders on all of us denis s camera s eye when it looks at things i know goes usually where mine would so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i don t know snow trekking too fast bicycling and forest darkness i ve known in small ways but the south seas not at all so i made better entry into l intrus both france and the crystalline isles of its finish than into beau travail l intrus is for me a very comfortable discomforting film it s a sequence of places portrayed familiarly with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we ve seen the reality or not a single image trebor cycling his massive weight on the thin racing frame the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires the asphalt ribbon the dark in bright sun evergreens cued me that the film would be linear a road trip a single will driven thrust despite trebor s personal power he s a human failure no matter who he s with he s alone though apparently he hasn t always been his body aborts life twice first to need the new heart then despite it l intrus is tragedy trebor is hubris i m navigating perilously the thread of what i remember let s leave it at that 
__label__1 having set the sitcom world alight with father ted arthur matthews and graham linehan s next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called hippies although created by the pair the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alone set in london in 1969 ray purbs a hippy is the editor of an anarchist magazine his friends are his flat mate the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex his girlfriend is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo simon pegg was superb as ray but he is superb in everything he is in this sitcom had a feel of citizen smith about it ray was very much like wolfie smith trying to beat society but failing miserably at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march i can t wait to buy it as it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television my memories aren t too good of the sitcom yet i remember two episodes really clearly the first being the opener protesting hippies which i thought was a great start where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was hippy dippy hippies which i think was episode 4 again quite a clear memory about the police sadly the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers i can t think why the bbc commissioned another series but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction oh well i can t wait for the dvd best episode hippy dippy hippies series 1 episode 4

__label__0 let me being by saying the i followed watching this video by watching saw and after bleed saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though i thought it was only fairly good bleed is pretty bad the best part is seeing the female cast nude the gore is very fake looking and over done it has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and i didn t want to stay to see the horrible ending if i could i would ban these actors and actresses the only reason being is that debbie rochon maddy has been in over a hundred other videos and i ve also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures they should not allowed to continue this madness 
__label__1 i am obsessed the story is amazing and the show is highly addictive but i love it i am on season 2 disc 5 and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show and michael is on my list now kidding i am so happy to see there is a season 3 because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending i can t wait to see the rest now thanks to the directors producers and actors of lost i enjoy watching tv again before lost i surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment 
__label__0 honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen this film dosen t have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from the omen and other movies like it for example the nanny lucy in this film is actually one of the devil s minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan does this sound a lot like mrs baylock to anyone else another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in the omen however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body yet another coincidence and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls much like the priest in the omen having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall paper please don t even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and the omen for you because as i ve stated above there are far too many to mention here 
__label__1 upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s you must see this movie 
__label__1 i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane i ve seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 at that time i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte s novel i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes i d like to see it again because it s so good :)

__label__0 this movie wasn t awful but it wasn t very good i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid the book is great and he cant t believe a kid wrote it toni collette plays the kids guardian who you don t know if this kid really exists or if she s making it all up i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scary the acting is pretty good and toni collette s performance was awesome as well as robin williams the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd 
__label__1 kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants on the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life i don t think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirelli s romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the mayhem this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages 
__label__1 for what it is this is a pretty good movie i like both johns stamos full house stockwell christine top gun they both give strong performances the love interest is ok but this is more of a guy s movie than a good date movie i love harleys and i hated seeing them paint over the 14 coats of hand rubbed lacquer with good old army olive drab there is a small history lesson here in that harley davidson motorcycles played a key role in wwii i don t know if the training was quite like this bunches the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere with good riding action sequences i love looking at the demographics of the vote history one 18 year old man gave the movie a 10 true bike lover i guess i wouldn t give it a 10 but i did give it an 8 i do not weigh every movie with the same scale there are movies that were big budget with great actors that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big star wars episode i is my best example i loved the first three sw movies but i thought episode i was weak in comparison so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie i expect more from george lucas 
__label__1 it s a genuine shame that this spin off tv series inspired by the superior made for tv pictures the night stalker and the night strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl kolchak s spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the sentry and horror in the heights plus you can t go wrong with such tried n true fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn john fiedler john dehner severn darden and william daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewer set climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest small time chicago illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchak kolchak was the quintessential 70 s everyman protagonist a wily and quick witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon oakland was perfect as carl s chronically ill tempered boss tony vincenzo jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster make up and special effects the titular lycanthrope in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in chopper cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in the youth killer but even the second rate shows are redeemed by the program s trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavin s boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence 
__label__1 soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the sacarstic cynical humour like that in paul verhoven s starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere one particular trivia bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo d onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate for the oblivious ones out there tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty s elegiac last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic i ll give this one 3 out of 5 
__label__0 if i accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i would read it and maybe laugh i would not however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh although i am still not altogether sure where these are i don t care if this is woody allen this writer cannot write dialogue or at least he cannot knowingly write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clowns for example paraphrase i m an art historian i m looking to get a job in an art gallery ok so it states the fact but honestly do you know of any art historians who would say that how would you answer really an art gallery who would ve thought it the entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi intellectualism that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer i admit that i have no knowledge of allen s other work and judging by this one i don t want to start learning the characters are loathsome without exception an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition or really really poor character writing you be the judge :(
__label__0 ringmaster jerry springer s pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film first of all it was made second of all people went to see it third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen if a monkey could make a movie i m 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good most crappy movies have their moments even godzilla had a few cool special effects this film s moment was when i left the theater nauseated the only thing that possibly could ve made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half i ll take a dump in a can if anyone didn t utterly despise this movie i pity you and your children and your children s children s children however contrary to springer s beliefs i clearly don t condone children having sex 
__label__0 this had to be one of the worst films ever when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping so hollywood another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement andie s acting is so bad in this film i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed andie anyway this was such a campy movie i usually like these type of films but i just couldn t get into this film too many unlikely situations and again andie s acting didn t help the film also she is all gums lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals 
__label__1 iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as cupid s helpers the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light hearted yet thoughtful movie you don t quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space time of our age the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout walter matthau is a perfect einstein meg ryan creates a quirky scatter brained mathematician and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science all together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart 
__label__1 the best thing about this movie is that it is fun it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the blithe innocent pecker played appealingly by edward furlong who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life other great characters include pecker s friend matt he s a thief but he s really a nice guy pecker s sister chrissy who is addicted to sugar and pecker s catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the virgin mary in her room the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy handed about it there is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of common people of sliding into a kind of reverse holier than thou but pecker avoids these traps allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun 
__label__1 this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed the book by rebecca west was written in 1918 soon after wwi when shell shock and trauma induced amnesia were not clichés as the reviewers call it many books and movies later it is difficult to go back in time and live as the characters lived the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas the british class system the wife thought all important the hopeless spinster and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago alan bates as the amnesiac soldier who will die if he isn t allowed to see margaret the girl of his youthful dreams builds on the devotion his character showed in far from the madding crowd having seen that performance it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn t live up to the family s and society s expectations margaret says we quarreled and as you rowed away you turned your face away from me so we know that the breakup was something that he instigated that it brought him shame but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret i haven t seen all his films but in the ones i ve seen he imparts a strong masculinity which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier i didn t even recognize ann margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated not having read the book i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris though jenny does state that she is a cousin the way kitty keeps jenny in the nursery in the hair drying scene the fact that kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun or sentiment about a lost child and the statement she made that she wished chris hadn t felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child also jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover non sexualin keeping with the mores of the time from 50 years ago i couldrelate to margaret s and her husband s dilemma i too was cast aside because i wasn t good enough for his family and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet i was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn t believe he loved my husband like margaret s was very understanding but the strain was very real the lover was finally able to reconcile his real life situation with his fantasy of loving only me i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chris s mind i thought of mrs dalloway with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus chris s joy in his fantasy of margaret in contrast the actiona of the soldier in mrs dalloway seems overwrought showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced everyone seems to get their life back but was it the right choice 
__label__1 this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster jimmy stewart and ronda castle ruth roman she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction neither trusts a member of the opposite sex apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from skagway to dawson but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff meanwhile rene a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return yet she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson along with ronda she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon s gunslingers at his gold claim walter brennan as ben serves as jeff s long time sidekick he doesn t have a meaty role but serves to soften jeff s hard edges his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff john mcintire as sheriff gannon makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying evidently he sees something of himself in jeff repeatedly declaring that he s going to like him he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith who spent his last years in skagway as one of the premier con men of his times jeff is the quintessential antihero a loner except for companion ben who doesn t want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job in this respect he closely resemble s burt lancaster s character in vera cruz for example thus jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon s gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone s insufficiently legal gold claims while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive then jeff has a sudden change of heart apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself he changes from anti hero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon s gang from dawson in this respect he differs from lancaster s character who never reforms but is jeff truly changed or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women clearly ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff although she is clearly characterized as a bad girl jeff has a checkered recent past himself having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon and having stolen his cattle back from gannon ironically soon after jeff changes from anti hero to hero rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon s impending ambush she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didn t just look out for herself his supposedly just abandoned creed it s clear that corine calvert as renee just doesn t make a credible substitute for the dead ronda in jeff s mind yet the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda s saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later i m also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her he s not her father another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon s gang if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk before jeff did the same to him and how did jeff s badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow and why weren t most of ronda s pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon s gang the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action all in all a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end no doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and geography especially the part taking place in the canadian yukon which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway 
__label__0 if it wasn t for the bad dialogues and script i mean the direction was really in touch with it s subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless you re a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result lately are rather poor this is after s1m0ne a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles 
__label__1 i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the environmental anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late 1800s probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot 
__label__0 it s getting worse the series is on a serious down fall the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can t act the story is alice having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice s unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one 
__label__0 it is pretty surreal what these flies can do eh well this is a cartoon so anything can happen in it at first i must tell you that i love animated movies unfortunately this year s repertoire is very weak this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws 1 i quoted the tag line it suggests that this movie has great 3d effects well i did not see any at least not something special i never saw before 2 the flies in this movie look nothing like real flies at least they could ve make them black but cyan flies seriously with giant heads and slim torsos 3 the story i guess it was written for 6 year old kids i could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified 4 excessive patriotism for example they are american files after all oh give me a break 
__label__1 lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up it s a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane there could have more to the plane but other than that the whole movie was pretty good i especially liked the ending because it was heart stopping i didn t know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it for me this movie just took off 
__label__0 it was probably just my dvd but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog some of the talking still remained sub audible if you re from scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds including unwrapping a package footsteps even puffing on a cigarette with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down there is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing but this effort in a time of war would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity after about a half hour i gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either 
__label__0 a sad sad sight indeed is the munster s revenge the munsters are brought back one last time fred gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of herman munster in this made for tv movie about a pair of wax replicas of grandpa and herman that are robots terrorizing the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy s stash at an exhibit with the police on their heels the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names we get to see them dress in drag as waitresses a minor highpoint in the film grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times one time even flying to transylvania with herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles i guess and a most annoying relative the phantom constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium what is most sad is hard to pinpoint is it that gywnne especially and al lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them maybe it is the ridiculous script sid caesar s crazy mostly unfunny antics or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super k mart fashion makeover at any even the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for munster standards as for the rest of the cast yvonne de carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience k c martell makes an ever so not affable eddie munster jo mcdonell is an attractive marilyn bob hastings as the aforementioned phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner the film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made for tv movie 
__label__1 i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must see movie for people that love movies about nature the movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses the footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky however beautiful a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series planet earth narrated by david attenborough i found attenborough s narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth earth is an easier movie it skips much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his planet earth series for instance earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and doesn t contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like large sharks etc to me that s an important difference that together with attanborough s far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth still however i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it s easier to understand makes it interesting for children too 
__label__1 ok there are people who should not see this movie 1 don t see it if you don t like satire or black humour 2 don t like it if you got offended by _the watchmen_ 3 don t see it if you want a serious superhero movie the rest of you run don t walk to see _mystery men_ it s funny it s quirky it s a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man occasional forays into junior high humour don t ruin the tongue in cheek low key fun of jeanane garafalo ben stiller and hank azaria as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear good to see louise lasser getting work too i laughed all the way through utterly unserious somewhat weird but good 
__label__1 for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don t know if america s gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non hollywood the actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo i ve seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i ve seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors 
__label__1 utterly brilliant powerful and evocative the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war it s tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war it allows sir laurence olivier s quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war corpses everywhere explosions terrified citizens and soldiers broken men indifferent politicians mistakes that cost thousands of lives the suffering of the innocents most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of civility are removed there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on perhaps there could be a follow up series called the century at war for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this 
__label__0 already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally fallacious when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies or anything for that matter it s time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton i know not too difficult zizek s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories to rant without a beginning or end and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the super ego i m kind of surprised he didn t play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell it s like the premise of schumacher s the number 23 play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess di s death however there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoo s nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours it s like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasions i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldn t have been the illogical far fetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated i e the easily impressionable and the gullible zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done don t laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a blood stained toilet while they were conceiving directing that scene talk about putting words into one s dead mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in anti feminism and other nonsense into his theory zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof common sense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the end goal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsd tripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001 s the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently that s another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable ground breaking physical set up in dogville made me snicker however zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious like all social scientists an oxymoron he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it s what we already all know but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listener i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie suit slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kid s park near you http rateyourmusic com

__label__0 beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there the characters basically make no sense most of the time the film has no real beginning middle or ending nor is anything ever explained much the film opens with a young man with the unlikely name of hazel motes apparently returning from a stint in the army he hitches a ride to a two story house that is in extreme disrepair windows boarded over he goes in the house walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there this scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing further about the house or its history it is never explained exactly whose house this is or where the people have gone but we are given the impression hazel has probably lived there at one time hazel decides to go to a city why we don t know once he arrives in this city he writes down a name address that he sees on a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman who is a surprisingly fat hooker he sees her for awhile and then he apparently isn t seeing her anymore like everything else in this movie it comes to nothing and serves no purpose a young man named enoch tries to befriend him but hazel really isn t interested although they keep crossing paths enoch is about as crazy as you can get one of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly we never really know why enoch behaves as he does or why hazel behaves as he does beyond the fact hazel had an overdose of old time scary fundamentalist religion via his grandfather enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it hazel who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching i got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him he has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter although their interactions never really make any particular point and there is no plot line eventually hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins self harming it is a very odd film interesting in it s oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it the cast does an outstanding job but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline the film also has the characters tossing around the n word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog 2 stars
__label__0 and a few more no s on top of that voodoo academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time what exactly is it trying to do tell a story obviously not as has been pointed out most of it s just barely legal guys rubbing themselves could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact which is to the delight of none repeated about eighty thousand times well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his work never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i ve ever seen it s like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a grinder then runs them through a coffee filter only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans it s the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting the result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10 day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort 
__label__1 what a real treat and quite unexpected this is what a real thriller movie is all about i rushed into the video shop grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best i was totally surprised and delighted i really enjoyed the actors and their characters i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic the plot was well thought out well written and directed it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute i highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention definitely a 10 out of 10 from me 
__label__0 violence whether real or not always has an impact in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of but what was the point the violence looks like a mix of noë s irreversible and kubrick s clockwork orange both of which are remarkable films don t get me wrong i m not opposed to screen violence at all and i ve seen some nasty stuff in my film going years but this film as a whole is totally juvenile the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence the rizla paper thin reason we are give for robert s demise is his introduction to drugs danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for robert s drug fuelled demise however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes lesley manville is robert s unable to cope mum i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber the acting is wooden the scene in the kitchen with the tv cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues some of the comments the boys make looks like she s enjoying it are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clay s ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director s adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery one can only wonder at this young man s psychology the political meaning of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes in the bar outside the tv cook s house war in iraq reports was perhaps too obvious in my opinion yes war is violent social determinism causes frustration we re all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you re in politics or on the street popping e juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man this issue is one that we still haven t managed to grasp and certainly not in this film my opinion derivative badly made and pointless 
__label__0 this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched i couldn t sit through the whole thing i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping i mean what was that all about i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have ingwasted a 4 rental fee the quality both picture and sound are terrible the acting well doesn t exist it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup urghh avoid at all cost the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they d be willing to take their tops off while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn t make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears this was like possibly worse than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car definatey not one to buy folks sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have 
__label__0  contains spoilers the truly exquisite sean young who in some scenes with her hair poofed up looks something like elizabeth taylor is striking in her opening moments in this film sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust her face and body are tense and distracted unfortunately once the bust is over young s strained demeanor never changes this is one fatally inhibited actress one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend arnetia walker to grasp what is missing in young walker is open emotional and at ease at all times in that there s no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it she is an open book young on the other hand acts in the skittish self conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film basically she doesn t have a clue with this major void looming at the center of the movie we re left to ponder the implausiblities of the story for instance after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she s trailing and locked in a closet she breaks the door down when left alone granted she s dressed only in a bra and panties but in a similar situation with a psycho captor due to return any moment would you head for the door or take the time to go through his dresser take out some clothes and get dressed i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss young s character is experiencing but young can not convey this type of complexity there are a few affecting moments in the film such as the short police interviews with the criminal s past victims but overall this is an aimless endeavor it s too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor batman and dick tracy because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching watching miss young try to act at least in this thriller is a sad spectacle 
__label__1 one of my favourite domestic movies i don t know if there is any person in our country who hasn t seen this movie it s funny and sad at some moments i don t know how did people around the world who had opportunity to watch it accept this movie because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the 20th century to be able to understand it but as i see here there is somebody from canada who watched it and he liked it i think that i ll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site but first to find out how to do that cheers 
__label__0 one scene demonstrates the mentality of terminator woman pretty well karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain s camp karen runs across an armed guard who points his gun at her but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight karen kicks him in the balls picks up the gun and runs away then again when a film is directed by a martial artist and written produced by another member of his family you know you shouldn t expect too much karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love hate relationship but after about 20 minutes they get separated and the film slows to a crawl and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up it lacks excitement the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano a womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value on the positive side kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film 1 2 
__label__0 but thomas ian griffith just doesn t have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made 5 years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow plummer s character was so corny he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon personally if action flicks are going to show skin i d have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don t show any 
__label__1 tigerland 2000 1 2 out of four by blake french throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield joel schumacher 8mm a time to kill easily one of the riskiest directors currently working has found resemblance with the thin red line in the way his new drama tigerland steps in an individual soldier s shoes this movie written by ross klavan and michael mcguther has more guts and irony than the thin red line or even saving private ryan although the movie s dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war i would want to know joel schumacher s experiences with the army are the men really this unabashed and brutal i am sure some of them are but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named roland bozz colin farrell who is rebellious against the ideas of war his personality instantly counteracts with several other characters one who becomes his best friend paxton matthew davis and another wilson russell richardson whose flamed temper often exasperates bozz s tension with the idea of going to war the war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield but on training grounds of a louisiana based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training this film is specifically about the preparation for war nothing more nothing less it ends when the soldiers finally go to war kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget joel schumacher accurately displays a gritty perverse cruel and unmerciful atmosphere using hand held cinematography unique lighting techniques and direct sound schumacher s grainy and blown out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature this unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie quite graphic in its use of coarse language perhaps a little too disturbing waves of four letter words pound the audience some in shock of what they are hearing even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking true and emotional if anything tigerland provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken such thought provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees this movie is not for all audiences but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such 
__label__1  possible spoilers although done before and better in midnight express and return to paradise brokedown palace still strikes a chord with me here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through thailand and get arrested on charges of trafficking drugs was it clare danes alice was it kate beckinsale s darlene was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey none of that really matters for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to throw in bill pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and jacqueline kim as his thai bride and better lawyer than he is and we have a nice little story that holds the audience s attention brokedown palace is nothing extraordinary or notorious for any reason it is not an original concept it doesn t show sensationalised violence that leads to the wannabe avant garde crowd talking about it s gritty realism or hard hitting truths it is merely a good story with some fine performances bill pullman is weakest with his lazy drawl and gravelly way of talking i was quite bored with the character kate beckinsale while decent is nothing spectacular she acts well but it s not exactly a memorable performance jacqueline kim however is in fine form crafting a likable and defined character where really there is not much to work with but make no mistake this is clare danes movie i ve long been a fan of her work and this is no change she captivates in every scene she appears and were it not for her the film would probably stoop into boring fare i particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and darlene s father the film also has a brilliant soundtrack 7 out of 10
__label__0 stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross eyed repairman the doctor comes in for a check up and after some tests he recommends drinking goat s milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspaper s front page reads that killer nick grainger escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollie s rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollie s rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isn t a great black and white film well here s another nice mess you ve gotten me into was number 60 on 100 years 100 quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay 
__label__0  mad dog time trigger happy whatever you wanna call it simply doesn t hit the mark maybe its just me maybe i just don t like gangster comedies as i thought oscar johney dangerously and mafia also sucked it s probably more witty sharp wordplay than all out comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it or the other reviewers make it out to be the rick mick vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch there wasn t enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in the majority of the film was either set in dreyfus s club or a variety of offices dim rooms what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning the supporting cast was on paper excellent great to see silva drago but characters were killed off before they had time to develop and richard pryors cameo was a joke the romance and love element of the film also bogged it down 4 10 i don t think i ll return to it anytime soon 
__label__1 roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemary s baby and chinatown probably what makes polanski s cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making low key movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horror suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done polanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartment themed films repulsion rosemary s baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky s head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant trelkovsky s descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening sub world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film also the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive if a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turn off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky s own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thought provoking plot like this one while the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksi s masterpieces 10 10
__label__0 every once in a while i will rent an action adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important this is why i own a copy of charlie s angels 2000 not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason in any case i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged for the most part i got what i wanted the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode and the kathy long s acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys unfortunately most of them die pretty darned quick like most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasn t strong to begin with deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting however the more kathy long fights the more time the director devotes to her backside by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy long s tight red shorts were center screen unfortunately there just wasn t enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours by all means go to the grocery store and spend the 50 cents on the rental there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie just don t expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours unless of course you happen to like kathy long s derrière then you might want to purchase a copy 
__label__0 i can t believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don t eat quite as often brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin 
__label__0 okay i was bored and decided to see this movie but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage then basically that same hour repeated 4 times it consists of 1 gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan 2 flashbacks to the men s wives 3 the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4 men running up hill and shooting usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him 5 defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs that was the basic movie and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times and every time it did a flashback to the wives it would show the man then his wife and him there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time other than that the men couldn t kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades i liked the music and there was a lot of action though the action was repetitive overall i probably wouldn t see it again but it wasn t too horrible 
__label__0  spoilers i m sure back when this was released in 1958 it was much appropriate for its time back then films were slower paced to allow audiences to follow and analyze the story here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife the gardener mickey played by alex nicol who also directed he film really is an underappreciated character he gets a skull to indirectly warn jenni that she is in trouble since he knew that there was foul play in the first wife s death he can t tell jenni directly what happened so he tries to scare her off with the skull jenni we also find out saw her parents die thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to institutionalization like many audiences today i found the pacing to be a little too slow for my tastes but if you like slow paced horror without a lot of gore this film is for you 
__label__0 i am a huge fan of ted v mikels and the original corpse grinders is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen even the brilliant casting of the legendary liz renay desperate living could not save this worthless piece of garbage this film should serve as a lesson to all past present and future film makers when you have a film as successful as the original corpse grinders was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as herschel gordon lewis did with blood feast 2 all u can eat even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for god s sake never film a movie onto video why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous i personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that s even worth the powder to blow it to hell if you can t afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can and what was ted v mikels thinking about or smoking when he wrote this god awful script i mean come on dog and cat aliens from another planet a cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding up human bodies bones and clothes and all if any of these actors aside from liz renay were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid avoid this film at all costs and watch the original instead 
__label__1 i recently watched this but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was in short i had no idea what it was was it a documentary was it a comedy routine well it was both it started a little slow but i think that s because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing but it quickly sucked me in the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history mainly how we american s learn history that isn t really true and how we got to learn what we did he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode 
__label__0 ha without a doubt tommy s the evil one here i don t know why but for some reason little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches and since they re kids they won t die because they re annoying well except for asylum of terror but those are few and far between anyway onto the movie can t find this movie on dvd sure you can all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for 15 but you also get 49 other movies what a bargain pff ok i m done advertising for these cheesy movies let s just say this movie ain t worth the 15 bucks on its own so we have a chemist scientist yeah cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter he s trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3 4 of the movie to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she was never married scandalous but of course tommy is one of the most irritating characters no i take it back he is the most irritating character far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter s work and gloats over him while he s in the hospital that s right even as an old cripple you can still be the villain so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he s the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal however at the end he ends up de evolving into a lizard yeah i know don t ask the ending really doesn t make any sense and if you re hoping for any really good payoff you re not going to get it this isn t a horrible movie it s just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list you re not in for a snoozer but you re also not in for a great movie just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food because this movie isn t going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10 
__label__1 this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date however i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on dvd actually i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd firstly there was a theory about how naives our generation was secondly i think there is something more i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre this is the mutilation the idea which gives coherence to the film the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture i remember how sick the sensation was when the monster rip kurt s arm out and at the end when the creature bites the doctor s neck to take a piece of his veins another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes no matter if the action is on a secret lab a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body a striper dressing room and so on may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things for example in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancée s head a more accurate work made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting same thing with all action scenes including the one of kurt s arm furthermore something could be done with the monster s make up some remakes have been good i think in this case an attempt would worth while nevertheless the black and white tones should be conserved 
__label__0 everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that s not the only reason why this movie is really bad it s actually so bad that i m not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark if the first episode of les visiteurs was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it clavier is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like lemercier because she s replacing her but that s grotesque lemercier is lemercier robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she s not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played lemercier playing her role as for the story it s just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and déjà vu no really there s no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment 2 10
__label__0 i ve been reading posts here concerning wonder woman s costume for this tv movie it should be pointed out at the time the movie was made she wasn t wearing her traditional outfit the producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer s conception of ww for the early seventies as for the movie itself i have to agree with many of the other posters here snoozefest i was a kid when it appeared on abc in 1974 so i was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero yet i was so engrossed with the plot i stopped watching it three quarters into the movie of course i wasn t at the right age to appreciate cathy lee :)
__label__0 personally while i m able to appreciate really good movies i also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap you know those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie cutter action movie to kill time this is the only movie that i can remember actually shutting off in the middle and i have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it the plot was so contrived and predictable i was calling out what the next scene would be easily and i m usually not very good at this the actors were horrible i ve seen better acting in middle school plays even the scene cuts were bad the flow was all wrong this movie is like a parody that forgot the funny 
__label__0 this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of they saved hitler s brain the worst movie i have ever seen period when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness some flatulence jokes some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let s make a deal with stupid grossness the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering there is no difference with a french accent was well you get my point the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie oh yea i ve read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970 s and you will like this movie if you are high well most of the country was not stoned in the 70 s if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was 
__label__0 spoiler warning when the main character s sister is pushed down the stairs the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make it appear that she s been drinking but right before she is killed tells her sister s business partner teri garr on the phone that she hasn t had a drink in 4 days yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report and the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs huh really bad mistake in this movie which is pretty awful overall surprisingly bad considering the great cast some faults the writing isn t very good the music is made for tv bad and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie 
__label__0 hobgoblins hobgoblins where do i begin this film gives manos the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made this one is fun to laugh at where as manos was just painful to watch hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term 80 s cheeze the acting and i am using this term loosely is atrocious the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k and that version is the only way to watch this mess this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one liners they have ever done if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the bots god help you 
__label__1 this movie is really not all that bad but then again this movie genre is right down my alley sure the sets are cheap but they really did decent with what they had if you like cheap futuristic post apocalyptic b movies then you ll love this one i sure did 
__label__0 watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans it s a mercy that anthony quinn couldn t persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey but it is filled with amusement value since yul brynner has hair lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent and the rest of the big names strut about in comic book fashion 
__label__0 i will start this off by saying i couldn t get all the way through it i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasn t any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who approved this project they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity that s the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam the acting isnt much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos yay who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser that s about as much of the plot as i understood overall it s the worst movie i ve ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many co workers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think i d ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in my response is always well now you can 
__label__1 goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ of its time this was not a bond game based on material from another medium this was a completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay was excellent and if you re a fan of the bond games or films alike you ll enjoy it unlike some most games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with a very bond able storyline you feel like you re in the game as much as you get lost in a movie enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game there s still plenty more to be done with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved as well as its multi player missions this is a stand out game despite being quite old now in video game years it s still a good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it i ve got the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and well written storyline the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesome i ve gotta go throw this game on now if you haven t played it yet you re missing out 
__label__0 dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor to much calm down get yourself together and make us laugh i didn t quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars just because there both up on stage or something he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star i m sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru i also liked the reese s pieces joke if dane just didn t act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating as high as maybe an eight 
__label__0 sure this one isn t really a blockbuster nor does it target such a position dieter is the first name of a quite popular german musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about it is based on the autobiography dieter bohlen wrote a few years ago but isn t meant to be accurate on that the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for american standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a bohlen fan or not technically speaking there isn t much to criticize speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok movie 
__label__1 robert taylor and stewart granger switch the goodie baddie roles they held in all the brothers were valiant taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad guy role but granger plays his part perfectly however the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest the film is perfectly made with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given the direction is taut and although the film is no light hearted entertainment it is to my way of thinking a major film unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti 
__label__1 without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film performances by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spy rudiger weigang axel real name alexander hampel magnus czech intelligence controller ray mcanally magnus con man father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus mentor believer and british controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major membury are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u s intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others 
__label__1 my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times i can t imagine how it could be better this isn t the complete history of wwii no library could hold such a history but it is the best summary of that history lots of detail lots of personal stories and still keeps the overall picture in view olivier s narration is excellently written and of course superbly given the interviews are from all sides except the russian because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd we treasure our copy the producer s do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles for instance but still the episode on this subject is very well done 
__label__0 this movie is little more than poorly made fetish porn and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era this was recommended to me by friend as a unique film experience he was right i suppose he meant that as a joke not disgusting not even that shocking just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art a little bit of camp value though i don t believe the makers of this film intended this and yes as a previous reviewer mentioned it s sex with a guy in a bear suit don t spend a lot of money on this try to borrow it if you must see it or contact me i d be happy to sell you my copy for half price i may have to see another of this particular director s films as he seems to have a certain following but if it s anything like this i will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever 
__label__1 this is the second baby burlesk short to be released and probably the most popular one is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie porn that is being claimed it is just a cute little film i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the 80 s and 90 s that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a mature manner it was more provocative because they weren t dressed in diapers there s nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes just a joke i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this that is sick to me if you watch this and are bothered by it then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film all of the b b films were parodies nothing more the parodies spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language shouldn t those be more appalling i can watch those without issue but they sometimes take children s stories and turn them into filth on those parodies that is what should get under your skin not that they babified not a word i know an adult movie from 1926 because we know how pornographic those silent films were huh not to mention those forbidden hollywood pre code era films so vile and filthy they would never make such filth today note the sarcasm 
__label__0 thanks to this film i now can answer the question what is the worst movie you have ever seen i can t even think of a close second and i ve seen some really bad movies absolutely nothing works in this film name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails honestly i ve seen better on youtube here s some typical dialogue steve steve steve is that you steve i m not kidding steve this isn t funny steve are you there steve steve steve arggh ahhhhhh nooooooo 
__label__1 in the spirit of the classic the sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart a prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation while the movie moves kind of slow it s climax and ending are stunning you ll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself
