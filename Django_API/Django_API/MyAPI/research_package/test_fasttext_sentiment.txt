__label__0 ok so i was bored and i watched it all the way through this film is mild inoffensive and lacklustre the story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles a tail of two traumatised children learning about god the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised it uses the irish blarney in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true irish ever see it aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an oirish accent all in all why do they pump these out 
__label__0 when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn t fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it we were misled in spades on my part i felt billy crystal s character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strong willed self determined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now that s entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his character if you re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if you re looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film it s none of the above 
__label__0 ben masters kyd thomas dream lover 86 plays a sort of mike hammer character a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals kyd makes one big mistake when he stops morgan fairchild laura cassidy eva bomberg arizona summer 73 from getting beaten up and raped kyd takes laura home to his pad and when he wakes up she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home by the way kyd sleep in his bed and laura slept on the couch for this particular scene laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between kyd and laura all said and done this is a lousy picture and i purchased the dvd for only 1 50 and i really got ripped off 
__label__1 this is a really great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well written elements as for the littlest of the little rascals i honestly can t think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny but once again high on the cute factor after the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and well done for the time with an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable i haven t seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance 
__label__0 i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don t like to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven t watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 2 10
__label__0  grey matter aka the brain machine but the video people thought better of that the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977 it s that kind of movie the government has some kind of overriding interest in this brain machine project that has drafted four people who turn out to be roughly a philosopher a horny priest a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way my s has better production values than this it held my interest though just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing dabbling in four guys in a room character drama the answer a tract about how science is inferior to god thanks a lot it s like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle the priest is played by james roscoe p coltrane best the philosopher by gerald the republican simon mcraney also featuring very very very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention 
__label__1 i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy b w movies then you re sure to get a kick out of this rendition the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it s meant to be i personally find madonna s musical element to be a major part of this film the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i ve listened to often over the years it s just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era in my mind madonna s finest moment both on screen but especially musically this is sure to bring out the kid in you 
__label__0 did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn t pull this one out about two thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can t believe i signed the contract it s not the worst movie i ever saw but it s on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn t move with vaughn s con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can t get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into 
__label__1 while browsing the internet for previous sale prices i ran across these comments why are they all so serious it s just a movie and it s not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it i ve shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is racy big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much it s worth 
__label__1 brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve rather incredibly contra todos against everybody original title which the producers discarded god against everybody got very low gpa grade point average in this website it seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large actually it is not so brutal i mean as far as graphical violence is concerned its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would be lumpens i mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high tech equipment who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of grana graúda is this post modern man is his her only worry a quick almost impersonal ultra permissive lay amidst over satiating meals the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004 so far its shining editing style à la godard its curious soundtrack counterpoints its more than efficient overall cast and above all its original narration with subtle non chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue deserve at least an 8 mark 
__label__0 with this film bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film s might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of objectivity obviously it is not for one reason many scenes shot by pure chance are obvious set ups when that poor goat accidently falls off the cliff you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen for another his concealing of one important information the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film that is goitre a sickness caused by lack of iodine salt this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research heck if he checked cretinism in a medical dictionary he d have found goitre he might have ended up telling the truth about these people still doubtfully instead with his film he judges them constantly talking about them as cretins again and again dramatizing the action setting up scenes to create the spectacle all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all mighty objectivity bunuel talks all the time in this film not letting one word to the people he is filming he talks for them and even then judges them this piece is flawed to it s roots to it s ideology and it s a real shame it s considered a great film 
__label__0 this movie makes peter an elf in robin hood costume instead of a human boy in probably not robin hood costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter this movie makes wendy a babbling idiot and poor captain hook a total clown and of course as every disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head they made one of the lost boys that one the only character that has not been disgraced in this film is tink the only star is for her the story itself then the darling parents don t even get the time to notice their kids are gone probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it also the famous nursery scene between peter pan and wendy is a stunning piece of there are no thimbles and no acorns one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one it s a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal so know now if you haven t known it before this disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story which is not really a children s story but just a great great story this just annoys me to no end 
__label__1 i think that people are under estimating this incredible film people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1 10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10 10 for the pure entertainment of the film the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining 
__label__1 quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv 8 april 2002 this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shame what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http www dvdbeaver com film dvdcompare2 kingofmasks htmwonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw 
__label__0 somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and i ll start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wow spoilers for ang lee s hulk and the incredible hulk was it boring i almost didn t make it through ang lee s hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and that s no fun he s usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non angry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie ever but then something happened about 3 4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and dare i say it reasonably convincing extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good that s not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didn t require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non superhero action movies and that s quite a feat of course the ending got really stupid with bruce banner s father turning into some sort of shape shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron man s brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expected ok but what about the incredible hulk guess what it s boring too it has just a few appearances by the hulk and here s the thing the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lee s version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didn t even look like a living creature just some sort of computer generated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didn t look 5 years newer than ang lee s they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lee s failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly one dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though he s only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesn t do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lee s version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast paced but since nothing really happened anyway that s not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk he s actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster this is how i can definitively say ang lee s version was better if i ever have the chance to see ang lee s version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely i d just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience at least in ang lee s version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of course it is absolutely mind boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lee s hulk by making almost exactly the same movie it is to edward norton s credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film

__label__1 viewing de vierde man aka the fourth man is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience it s a very tight and intense psychological mystery thriller from netherlands s paul verhoeven he directed this film just before he got big with his free ticket to hollywood movie flesh blood in a lot of user comments on this site i noticed the mentioning of alfred hitchcock indeed this movie might very well be hitchcockian but i also noticed touches of early cronenberg the visceral flavors of david lynch surreal story linked visuals and even roman polanski plot wise set up funny thing is that the movies by those directors i was thinking of while watching de vierde man weren t made until after 1983 the year of release of the fourth man so go figure very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by gerard reve this movie is based on gerard reve is also the fictional name of the main character a tormented writer played by jeroen krabbé balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word rêve is french for dream and the film does feature a lot of dream like nightmarish sequences often to that extend that you don t always know for sure if gerard is awake or dreaming himself could this be coincidence maybe it s just me but i don t think so renée soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady in a rather demanding role she sometimes seems to be guilty of over acting in a subtle way but that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions proves again what an excellent actress she is i might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male female nudity as well as some rather explicit sex scenes and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for verhoeven s basic instinct another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references images which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative catholic movements at the time of its european release either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing now someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about de vierde man one of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the virgin mary to resolve itself i myself have big issues with the way catholicism has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies but surprisingly i had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to the fourth man although the virgin mary aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point i also had fun with it in a way i think the keyword as to why it didn t bother me at all is duality because this movie works on two levels although divine intervention might have resolved the plot line from the protagonist s point of view on the other hand the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman and that s the fun part you never know for sure and then there s the question could it be that gerard reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come like receiving omens at one point in the movie gerard even tries to fool christine into believing he is clairvoyant the way he is playing christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold so with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction de vierde man is a very much recommended viewing indeed especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film but make sure you see the original dutch version not the dubbed one 
__label__0 let s be honest as a film school project made without budget and real actors this is a passably interesting film as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer it s a very poorly produced product if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product i e a film i feel deeply disappointed it s a videotaped tv play something along the line of old sixties serials but without that certain charm aside from the leading man mr redfield who also is the director the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus a bit too old for that actually or members of the director s household who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches but also the make up artist or hairdresser a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s it s all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small bare studio sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame period inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion the film attempts to be dreamlike whereas in fact it s merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing and believe me the standards weren t too high to start with there are interesting dialogs every now and then but overall it s pretty lame and two dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew that s how artsy films attempted to look in the 80s mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director 
__label__1 another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice florence who that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen i soon found out who florence rice was a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece from 1939 its a different time but therein lies the charm it transports you into another world it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine she is absolutely delightful at the same time strong vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie she made over forty movies and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine alan marshal is of the flynn gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments but the real star is florence rice fans of 30 s 40 s movies don t miss this one 
__label__1 i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators i e chinese it becomes a story about values and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life and loyalties toward institutions amazingly enough it managed to do this in a gentle mildly humorous manner which only in retrospect seens threatening to one s status quo i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could 
__label__1 i rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it i had the opportunity to purchase it on dvd a few weeks ago and have watched it several times since i would have to agree with others when they said indian summer was nostalgic film when i watch it i wish that i could be 10 14 again i think that is why we all like the movie to some extent we all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom knowledge of adults wouldn t it be nice to have all your friends parents be young again to not have to worry about your job being a parent etc i know that i would like to jump into a de lorean and go back in time while i enjoyed the film very much my all time favorite camp film though is meatballs with bill murray i wish that they could make an indian summer version of that 
__label__1 it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi 1982 he was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago comparatively it must have been a lot tougher for director feroz abbas khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father pitting a shriveled anti hero against an international hero both of whom were historically real individuals and ironically father and son the events in the film are mostly real mahatma gandhi lived as shown in the film setting high moral standards for the world to follow yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide income for his nuclear family the film does not debunk gandhi and his ideals for gandhi his mission was larger than his family s aspirations he loved his family and cared for them though his thoughts for their appeasement were blinkered by his ideal of caring for the masses he stood for equality and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special undue advantages to his own son overlooking other deserving persons went against the basis of what he preached the film looks at an unusual case of parenting where an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less than brilliant offspring the film presents an unusual scenario that happened a son marries his childhood sweetheart upsetting his father the father upsets his son s educational aspirations at several key junctures the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation the son stumbles in valiant quest for identity and survival his marriage breaks and seeks solace in religion buffeting between islam and hinduism through all his tribulations his link to his mother remains until she chides him for being drunk feroz khan is essentially a director of plays making his foray into cinema he wrote and directed the play mahatma vs gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community the play and the consequent film were based on two biographies one by chandulal dalal and another by nilamben parekh the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium peter brook is a great director of plays but less competent as a film director the opening shots of khan s film promises great cinema a derelict harilal gandhi is brought to sion hospital bombay mumbai barely mumbling that his father is bapu the popular name of mahatma gandhi father to an entire nation the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be mahatma gandhi s eldest son dying in poverty and loneliness apart from the dramatic opening the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son meditating in silhouette for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust free and freshly laundered modern hairstyles of actors and even shefali shetty playing mohandas gandhi s wife a century ago with plucked eyebrows the bane of indian cinema since feroz khan is a theater personality he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater royal academy of dramatic arts knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble even when there was no direct criticism in the film producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally with all its mix of greatness and faults gandhi my father throws several questions at the viewer is a mother son bonding stronger than a father son bonding in parenting is one s immediate family less important than humanity at large does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered in this film harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another while his father quotes scriptures forgive them for they know not what they do when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty shah and an indian award from critics feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above average performances from the ensemble of actors i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad s tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards 
__label__1 im gonna make this short and sweet because i don t think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique for me its possibly the funniest show ever you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out for example the way hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes its all round classic i mean the cast the writers the director its just a recipe for success one actor i think who always gets a hard time is ashton kutcher but i mean he s great in this show i don t think its possible for the the character kelso to have been played by anyone else it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid all the main characters are great and it wouldn t be a worth while review if i didn t mention the stone cold fox mila kunis now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show 
__label__0 i ve always liked fred macmurray and although her career was tragically cut short i think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy lamour and charles butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you get a mediocre movie experience skid johnson fred and maggie carole meet cute during her visit to the panama canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love skid s a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he neglects maggie who later inspires him to start over after he s hit rock bottom ah yes it s the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soon stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it s difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and s l o w direction just don t give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesn t ring true this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours 
__label__1 this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man and how he must deal with everyone his mother is depressed his younger sister is a pain his older sister is somewhat accepting the relationship looks good with his boyfriend exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy unfortunately the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn t mean anything our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves dumping his new lover and starting over we are left with him starting over and viewing not participating in happiness so maybe things will go better for him in the future the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating 
__label__1 first of all do not call this a remake of the 63 film even though this version is truer to the stage play it is extremely long the casting was good with some exceptions chyna phillips was not a good casting choice she was almost 30 when she did this film and it was hard to believe she was a teenager jason alexander was good choice but after a while he gave me a headache tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee and showed he could even hold a tune like the 63 film they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it showed i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing so what made this a tv ratings flop it was lengthy for one they put in new songs and scenes even though some of the new songs were good like let s settle down was it really necessary now don t get me wrong i liked it but i rather watch the 63 film see my review this was just a case of some actors overdoing roles making some changes and once again length one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams she does a good job with the role and the music give her any lyrics and she could sing them so here is my advice coming from someone who s done a couple productions of bye bye birdie if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play watch the 63 film if you want to watch a version that is truer to the play watch the 95 version just take it in moderation though don t be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting 
__label__0 the cars in this movie are awesome the acting in this movie is awful the plot and driving scenes don t make much sense and are equally bad if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster save yourself the trouble and money good movie for racing fans well there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a nascar driver as a rally car driver if you can t tell the difference go watch it you ll have a blast it really comes down to this there are really really really nice cars in this movie they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot if you want to see hot girls turn on mtv or vh1 instead i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie they should be racing with rusted bicycles 
__label__1 great entertainment from start to the end wonderful performances by belushi beach dalton railsback some twists and many action scenes the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as redneck villain i must recommend this film to every action adventure fan 10 10
__label__0 the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie 1 clichés abound seriously awful twists are everywhere 2 the narrative jumps around in time which would be fine if done well but it s not 3 lame characters that don t develop so much as either remain utterly static or drastically change for no good reason 4 big one horrible acting over the top from nearly every person the following are some of the best points from the movie 1 the lead is damn good looking as i see it there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie a people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive b people who often think to themselves i like hollywood dreck rife with clichés and overacting but if only i could watch it in korean there s a lot of good korean cinema out there so why waste your time with garbage 
__label__0 yes there are great performances here unfortunately they happen in the context of a movie that doesn t seem to have a clue what it s doing during the first 45 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other to further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about 15 minutes of sung through dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section on top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used is the composers clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed while the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s motown sound the rest of the film is just bad broadway show music then there s the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to james brown to lionel richie when he started channeling stevie wonder i couldn t help laughing out loud this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and resent that i wasted two hours of it watching this film 
__label__1 enchanting romantic innovative and funny the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled exceeding better known death romances such as ghost while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long long stairway the joy is in the journey the moral of the tale of course is timeless love conquers all but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the directors vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi era yet for all the cosmic scale powell and pressburger knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level the wonderfully determinedly romantic aspect of stairway is captured with ultimate simplicity june s teardrop preserved on a rose petal this film like the story and the set itself is one for the ages 
__label__0 i m still trying to decide if this is indeed the worst film i have ever seen a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many bsers who populate this film the bs to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one at the end the interviewees seem to be saying we want you to _think_ but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact if you feel that you are open minded and wish to expand your consciousness please be open minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory einstein s universe nigel calder a slim volume not a challenge the cosmic code by heinz pagels if you can t bring yourself to read a book please don t complain to reviewers about being open minded to recap this film is just unbelievably bad you know what s a really good film which questions the nature of reality thirteenth floor directed by roland emmerich with craig bierko gretchen mol vincent d onofrio smart sexy thought provoking 
__label__0 there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we re supposed to be pulling for well let s see we learn he s a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities he treats his coworkers like cattle gets them involved in his own personal crisis in the process getting one of them killed jeopardizes the safety of his kids threatens his ex wife s new boyfriend tries to strong arm the police and school administrators and all this for what because he was thinking with his little head i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp it would have made for a far more satisfying ending 
__label__0 before i begin i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved including whittaker who indeed deserves his nomination it is highly entertaining and taken in the right context as a work of fiction it is a very good movie for that i give it the two stars however rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character dr nicholas garrigan is a complete invention of fiction rather it presents this character into a real historical setting and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real and what they are seeing is the truth i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction but to do so in such a dishonest matter is in a word reprehensible there can be no doubt that africa along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film but hollywood also has its eye toward making money the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much at the end of the day they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming see we told you it was bad the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin idi s second wife whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity in the film we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse arms for legs and vice versa this is the director making sure you understand that amin is as the gungans say bom bad but watching the documentary we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true so what they just make up these things why because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence that s why they don t trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves look that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media we don t need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that and this is just the tip of the iceberg what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin s wing as such garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world the producers seem to thing we won t be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it ironically even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons making several horrible mistakes and then redeeming himself even at the cost of three other innocent lives honestly i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind ron howard and akiva goldsman s sugary sweet adaptation of the life of john nash which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can t get enough of the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years and viewers who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves buy these fake portraits hook line and sinker look i m certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he wasn t my point is with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films why can they not trust us to think for ourselves can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves i urge all who continue to watch hollywood s purportedly true movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth 
__label__1 i adored this movie not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu although he is in practically all german movies that count but also because he is not the main actor the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat who was the only reason to watch 2001 s julietta and who really carries this movie on his shoulders a family moves from italy to germany seeking the german dream this is my own invention and ironic of cheap labor in steel and coal industries however they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming from this point onward the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family giancarlo bleibtreu and gigi metschurat gigi s dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother s determination to return to italy what follows is a great and totally neutral look at what life can become formed by the choices you make in the end this movie doesn t say which life gigi s or giancarlo s was more successful or fuller or more interesting it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration the fact that director fatih akin s moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast especially metschurat and this i really need to stress the little boy who plays young gigi that kid s performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone great movie go see it 
__label__1 a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend of course the sob is very good looking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre leaud s character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends it s tragic and you know she s going to end up very hurt but there s nothing you can do leaud is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very sweetly and charmingly sings along to amuse her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come it s a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears 
__label__0  the house of the spirits is quite awful i live in south america in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid things are not so simple and linear as appears here and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in the house if you can t show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema without so many commonplaces in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public s intelligence 
__label__1 i saw the movie recently and really liked it i surprised myself and cried this movie is in the same niche genre as away from her or even the bucket list but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity it s really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar the director does a masterful job with the challenge hagar s hard to understand her world has hard edges and she isn t a warm endearing woman at all the first scene gets this across without any compromise hagar ellen burnstyn is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter in law she figures it out en route and freaks out her edges are really hard she is mean she is belittling and selfish she is a stone i didn t like her not even a little bit throughout the course of the movie we get insight we find out why she doesn t like petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character i started to see the angel and i started to like her i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack ellen burnstyn you are a brilliant actor kudos kudos kudos what a scene this isn t a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person s life are there to protect they are there for a reason hagar isn t my mother she isn t even my mother in law or neighbor but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i ve watched the stone angel 
__label__0 normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the public s perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried incompetent attempt at a money grab piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sam s club for 8 bucks i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes now as per imdb s policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot seriously it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camera work spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer however the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks aren t two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie in a particularly grueling scene the main character is shown looking at a pod then he is shown pacing and panting then he looks at the pod then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod i apologize for the extreme run on sentence but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere the editing is mind bogglingly bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a farmer s house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer stutters and paces around when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs 
__label__1 i quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons the first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in northern ireland which is very rarely treated in movies most of which tell us about the republican struggle the second reason is the performances of the actors i thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores all in all it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who s who in northern irish actors cast it wont move the earth although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries 
__label__1 this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore i studied them in school it is very complicated you just have to take what it gives you enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride hooray 
__label__1 this movie reminded me that some old black white movies are definitely worth the look initially i had some reservations however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated i was very impressed with the mixture of drama suspense comedy arthur askey tommy gander is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time definitely add this movie to your movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or overly funny movies of today 
__label__0 went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4 unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn t see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks too cartoonish and very disappointing 
__label__0 i won t mention any of the plot because although it would be highly predictable anyway the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere in the movie comments in the plot summary here and even in the synopsis on my netflix envelope i might have enjoyed it more if i hadn t known that maybe this film has a deceptively good cast most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand including donald sutherland lesley ann warren and tia carrere and rosemary dunsmore in smaller parts it was impossible to like william mcnamara but that was clearly by design and there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian lenore zann but none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me don t any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on 
__label__1 this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see 
__label__1 i really wonder how this show plays in the u k and the rest of europe it is so self loathing about being an american particularly white americans that could be a big reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this board i love the show but it is with some reservations and i feel it took the easy way out by spoiler spoiler crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season julie slammed the door shut on any hope of reviving the show unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farm who knows it was a funny raunchy and on occasion kinda scary show 
__label__0 a lot of promise and nothing more an all star cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story that s okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon dynasty s releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a blight they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs but they can t bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like they re each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael biehn is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away 
__label__0 recap full moon a creature a huge werewolf is on the hunt not for flesh not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though but for a mate he is on the hunt for a girl not any girl though the girl the girl that is pure and also a werewolf although she doesn t know it yet three well check that two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf this particular powerful werewolf darkwolf is closing in on the girl if he gets her mankind is doomed now the cops has to find the girl convince her not only that there is someone a werewolf nonetheless that wants to rape her and perhaps kill her but that she is a werewolf herself and then they got to stop him comments this is one for the boys the teenage boys a lot of scenes with semi nude girls more or less important for the plot mostly less well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking one usually turns to two main themes nudity check and then special effects hmm well there are some things that you might call effects they re not very special though in fact to be blunt they are very bad the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds they couldn t afford clothes for some of the girls and the effects are cheap some of the transformations between werewolf and human form obviously done by computer are really bad you might overlook such things but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too and you never get to see any killings just some mutilated corpses afterwards and there is surprisingly little blood about in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood i m not sure what to say about actors and characters most of the times they do well but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above like the poor effects or the poor budget that could explain why there is precious little shooting even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving but hey when you re in real danger there nothing that will save your life like a good one liner unfortunately that can t explain moments when the cop steve the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem the werewolf that is runs away when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is just beside him now and that he cannot let it have her but sure it let the makers stretch the ending a little more but i wouldn t mind seeing none of the lead actors actresses get another try in another movie well to give a small conclusion not a movie that i recommend 3 10;)

__label__1 still being of school age and having to learn shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years which is very off putting of any writer no matter how good i didn t really expect to enjoy this film when my english teacher put it on i thought it d be the typical english lesson movie bad acting awfully shot badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog so as you can tell i was all but ready to go into a coma from the go however i watched and much to my disturbance found myself not only paying attention but actually enjoying the movie too this production of hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies i have seen in a long time and it really brings to life what i expect shakespeare wanted his plays to be like well with the difference that this is cinema much better than my english teacher harking over the text ever possibly could the story is good the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring though a little hard to keep up with if you aren t used to shakespeare s language and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn t expect mainly perhaps due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has brian blessed and charlton heston are as great as you d expect these two veterans to be even in such small parts but it is robin williams as osric and billy crystal as the gravedigger who really stand out giving such minor parts an unexpected zest as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy the main stars of course are also wonderful kenneth branagh excels as hamlet bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes making the movie as a whole much more watchable the other major players are also good but it is kenneth branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role the set pieces too are often quite stunning giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we re used to seeing in shakespeare productions as well as a real sense of the country around them of course the movie taken as a movie in its own right is not without faults but no major ones the pacing is the only real problem i can think of offhand as well as the prose for anyone not used to as i said shakesperean language and especially when compared to the sort of shakespeare productions i m used to seeing in class it really is quite brilliant it s even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on shakespeare that his plays are boring i came to the conclusion it s not the plays that are boring merely the teachers who recite them in class if only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one english students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the bard overall 7 10
__label__0 this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget no effort no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store if you want to know what watching this movie is like grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and attacking people congratulations you ve just made hood of the living dead now see if a distribution company will buy it from you i have seen some low budget shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort but this has neither avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies 
__label__1 this is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike drew barrymore is at her best in this movie as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical sports crazed sweetheart the comedy in this movie is great there were several laugh out loud moments their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day instead of leaving he helps take care of her helping her change into pajama s then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was very lady like no chunks everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single she tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wont feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on the curse of bambino everything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant eventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said i had to check my calender and when i saw the there was a red sox yankee game i knew i would be going stag after the party ben tells her it was the best night of his life shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him it was the best game ever ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life he says well that was a few minutes ago so they separate for a while he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he didn t it would remind him too much of what he gave up for them lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her it ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love lindsay they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st louis and it is a happy ending all around 2 thumbs up 
__label__1 i have seen the freebird movie and think its great its laid back fun about time the british film industry came through with something entertaining its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents nice touch the acting was convincing i am a biker they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting well done jon at the end a new crop gets mentioned in ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film hope so keep them coming great film well written realistic characters 
__label__1 nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready it s short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here she s a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know though we learn immediately that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend it s a live in situation once julia gets to the house she s drugged and when she wakes up she s told she s mrs hughes and not allowed to leave the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it 
__label__0 i saw this movie a couple years back i could nt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard s girl while she s unconscious then jarvis s buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richard s girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he s still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those 2 guys trouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i can t stand movies that are disturbing and don t make sense this was the worst film i ve ever seen since the 90 s version of lord of the flies 
__label__1 the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j horror movie this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks the story is about perception of the people who works lives and loves of our protagonist and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash backs as the movie runs its course and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems the movie mostly took place in a small out dated radio station s studio with a very bad history where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re locating it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co workers or it was all in his mind what i like about this film is that the film makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did this movie is a very smart abide rather short 76 minutes film 
__label__0 this was surely the stupidest crudest most repulsive film i have seen in quite some time i was tempted to turn off the vcr but as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident i literally found it compulsively hateable in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end i am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen animal house porky s there s something about mary both american pie movies and even the notorious freddy got fingered i have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms mamie van doren s breast baring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since the shining ineptly edited and shot with incredibly annoying performances from devon sawa and jason schwartzman the film ended without the benefit of having made me giggle once the only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture oh and it would also serve nicely as a lawn fertilizer 
__label__1  cry freedom is not just a movie it is a historical account heroic story and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating determined hero steve biko but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid the story of biko an influential leader and his main influencee donald woods is a heartbreaking one but the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa cry freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot it is because of great films like this one that the public can become educated on terrible events in history great leaders who sought to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future because of this importance cry freedom is an amazing film that should be seen by all 
__label__1 a somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of abraham lincoln s early years from director john ford concentrating primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder the film offers an interesting portrayal of this important american figure and the film is well made but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debates with stephen douglas the obvious intent was to portray lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become but the result for me was that while i admired the portrayal it just wasn t as satisfying as i think it could have been with a greater scope in the role of abraham lincoln we have henry fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength fonda s performance includes some gangly mannerisms and other affectations which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of lincoln particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming which occasionally is a bit to overt the supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of ford s regular supporting cast sometimes referred to as his stock company but we do have ward bond one of the most prolific character actors in hollywood bond has appeared in more of the afi top 100 films than any other actor both the original and revised list he has also appeared in 11 best picture nominees the film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in to kill a mockingbird where it would be done even better than it is here even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film 
__label__1 this movie is just great it s entertaining from beginning to the end you re always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain rescue guy gabe walker together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker and then john lithgow one of the best performances i ve seen of him as a villain and the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action brilliant movie 
__label__1 after reading the original play i thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be donal mccann puts in a once off great performance as public gar the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted but unseen to others alterego private gar eamonn kelly also plays an excellent screwballs whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by gar definitely worth renting out if you can find it probably unavailable outside ireland uk 
__label__0 one wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen like it s the case with this movie the wedding date is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake under the guise of a new story something that should have been let alone if a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos approval then go all out with big stars and glossy production values that way people will come for the stars alas that s not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy the problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to london when basically this seems to be a typical american situation that not even the setting will be able to fix then there is the problem with the stars debra messing and dermot mulrooney they have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar since the kat and nick have no conflict from the start the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be it s clear that kat will fall for nick and vice versa in this predictable story amy adams who was the best asset in junebug comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her for anyone interested the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes 
__label__1 while i don t agree with bob s and tammy s decision to give up baby jesse and it s something i d never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects patty duke antagonist almost unheard of as far as i m concerned but during the movie she really convinces you that she s psychotic or at least that there s something seriously wrong with her her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think it s not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that ll make you laugh but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from others perspectives and discover a little something about yourself caution you may even grow while watching this movie and it s all worth it in the end 
__label__1 warning possible spoilers but not really keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won t have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no one else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 2 plus teri hatcher from tv s superman every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old fashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the show s perennial award winning lead nicknamed america s sweetheart the daytime emmies like awards opening does introduce us to celeste s show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because it s always such a genuine thrill adam did you watch i won well nguh the reason for adam s absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and we re instantly off on a trip with celeste s neuroses she cries screeches and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee kathy najimi constantly waddling after celeste unseen through celeste s fog of paranoia indulges a taste for tammy faye baker for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired rosie schwartz whoopi goldberg has seen it all before she is the head writer of the show and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years so when celeste freaks rosie offers to write her off the show for six months we ll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama but celeste has doubts i thought that the dalai lama moved to la well then some other lama fernando lamas come on such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas son of aforementioned fernando lamas d 1982 those who can remember the economics teacher ben stein in ferris bueller s day off 1986 as he deadeningly calls the roll bueller bueller bueller will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall in real life mr happy days and brother of penny who gets paid 1 2 million to make the command decisions on the sun also sets he says he definitely likes peppy and cheap and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon who s a bitch geoffrey anderson kevin kline is the yummy with a spoon and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes robert downey jr and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character rod randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago somehow they work out the logical difficulties and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo choo celeste can now only get worse and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps first her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara but she soon degenerates into a stalker unfortunately she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily geoffrey s been promised development of his one man play about hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise i m not going back to florida no how argues geoffrey you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf and indeed seeing geoffrey s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as mr loman he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven the show s new ingenue so he s not leaving beautiful elizabeth shue as laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well but of course the course to true love never did run smoothly montana moorehead cathy moriarty is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicity will her plots finally succeed will celeste settle her nerves or will she kill tawnee first will the producer get mr fuzzy you ll just have to watch the second half of this utterly lovable farcically malicious riot and you ll really have to see to believe how the short sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter if you are not in stitches with stomach heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental soapdish 1991 is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again because it s not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines this is very well crafted humor almost all of it in the writing a draw with blazing saddles 1974 for uproarious apoplexy value although otherwise dissimilar watch it and weep a happy source for anyone s video addiction 10 out of 10 
__label__1 i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter the impossible planet and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn t hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 who series but thankfully my fears were unfounded as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the ood whom have become the devil s pawn there is also a bit of philosophizing on the doctor s part in the episode that i quite enjoyed needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though my grade b 
__label__0 a friend of mine bought this very cheaply and decided to give it to me as a birthday present i thought i d never watch it cause i knew it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic but then my friends and i got really bored and watched it from start till finish i know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece it s hard to describe you should see it it s a real lesson on what people are capable of when they believe they re creative and smart and really aren t the acting is sous terrain you can actually see the leading lady laugh on some occasions she s definitely the worst the story is to stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucked please pay special attention to the sheriff the guy is an adult and therefor has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this he s extremely bad as well whatever it did have some hilarious moments check it out haha
__label__0 this hamlet made for one of the boringest mst3000 episodes ever i am not a shakespear fan but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed like i said though this one is quite boring it is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn t help this is the one mst 3000 i can t watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep 
__label__0 there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is it simply defies description something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims mouth which kills them or turns them into zombies the whole thing is so wonky that it s stunning there s also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet i m not making this stuff up the computer also controls things like cars even though there s nothing linking the computer with the vehicle the film is total trash surreal bad trash spectacularly one of a kind bad trash there s a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there which aren t very hot or erotic there s even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula which had me rolling on the floor definitely one of the worst movies ever made up there with the equally wretched direct to home video boardinghouse or boogeyman ii both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush at least it s fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on 
__label__1 how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together josie bissett and rob estes who are married in real life play a couple who marry in las vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households each has two boys and two girls into a cohesive family unit what transpires when the group which includes four teenagers two preteens and two younger children makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim the fights between the kids and one little love affair between two of them make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along more interesting than the brady bunch what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours recommended as a feel good movie for all ages 
__label__0 this is shallow hedonism and or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman s scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancée is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an electra complex who cares all of the characters except for anne deborah kerr are vacuous and vile seberg is poor i agree with the boys with breasts comment of an earlier review the plot plodded this predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half if you want to see great gowns and jewels on the riviera i recommend to catch a thief in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters i like for films to entertain me i personally don t really care where a film is set whatever the time or place i want a good story comedy or drama i also want to see some enjoyable characters it doesn t hurt if i can relate to them poor deborah kerr gives a typically good performance and so does david niven in a despicable role the 2 rating is solely for kerr and niven and for the cinematography the rich color scenes and the murky foreboding black and white scenes unfortunately all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un enjoyable characters a sow s ear is still a sow s ear consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time 
__label__0 a terrible movie as everyone has said what made me laugh was the cameo appearance by scott mcnealy giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of sun logos mcnealy is the ceo of sun microsystem a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of microsoft they have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against microsoft so were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire there s no public record i see of sun s involvement but clearly the makers of this movie know scott mcnealy an interesting mystery 
__label__1 wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff 
__label__1 either or i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie i have re visited it many times and it always holds up a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it norman jewison a fellow canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is i have often wondered at the paucity of cher s acting roles whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in mask i found the comedic strokes broad at times a hair salon called cinderella but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera all extravagant gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat the brooklyn scenes are magical this is a brooklyn under moonlight romanticized and dramatic just like opera all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone s taste by a long shot i loved the ending everyone brought together like a greek chorus every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking 8 out of 10 
__label__1 this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it i don t normally rent movies like these ie indie flicks however i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy whom i have loved since the scream trilogy the movie director took a risk and it is a risky risk in telling the lives of many and i mean many different people and having the intertwine at various intervals taking that risk was a good idea because it s end result is an exceedingly good film the film has a few main characters dwight jamie kennedy a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument wallace gregory john carroll lynch an airplane loader technician who has a love for all living things except perhaps meter maids and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck cyr brian cox the owner of a chinese restaurant donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant cook sung alexis cruz under pressure to keep up with his phobia ernie christopher bauer is married to olive christina kirk who he is convinced is trying to stop him have fun look ridiculous go insane and not live a normal life they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and olive seriously begins to have doubts about ernie gordon grant heslov is a man whose life isn t going very well as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand mitchel jon huertas is convinced that gwen alexandra westcourt is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other though she is more skeptical he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts johnston michael hitchcock has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider he takes another job that he just isn t suited for his wife annelle arabella field is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that johnston wasn t quite the loving husband she thought he was all in all i definitely suggest this movie erica
__label__1 massive multiple chills down the spine i m surprised there s people who didn t like it i saw it at 10 o clock in the morning and still got scared stiff and i ve seen hundreds of thrillers horror movies for crying out loud i m 22 i mean ok voice acting not particularly good probably even b movie ish but the genuine look of terror the sound effects the flow from the very start hitting you again and again with relentless unforgiving terrorising scenes so many clichés yet none fails to surprise scare you know it s coming it s coming it s coming boo and you still jump off the chair grab a pillow and a blanket call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night hats off to the japanese 
__label__1 it s very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline it s a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i don t like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because it s so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion it s the best film of 1991 
__label__0 the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu 1980 this is hands down the worst film i ve ever seen what a sad way for a great comedian to go out 
__label__0 this movie was lame lame lame what a build up what a let down all form no substance a terrible waste of talent and time would not recommend it to my husband s dog who will watch anything 
__label__0 i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either 
__label__1 there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it first i was a typical high school senior in a shakespeare class i didn t really even like much less understood half of shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language and then i still wouldn t get most of it second it was 4 hours long i never thought that could be a good thing well let me tell you something this movie was so masterful so beautiful i actually understood all the language as it was being performed now the script was followed to the letter in this movie the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost but lo and behold when performed and only then shakespeare comes to life so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories when i saw it on the big screen especially in the high budget major motion picture style with beautiful cinematography and photography and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast somehow i understood what was going on what was being said the language is awesome and passionate it allows for more raw emotion when words can t describe something maybe shakespeare s words can i still hold to this day that fist of the north star animated english dub is the greatest movie ever made no movie provides more sheer entertainment but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position which hamlet did it came close is truly amazing awe inspiring it wasn t a movie it was an event even more amazing it made me appreciate shakespeare wow powerful powerful is the word one of the rare truly powerful movies out there this gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars yes yes by the way all you kids out there in a shakespeare class forget it you re wasting you re time you have to see the plays performed only then will justice be done to them 
__label__0 it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the medusa touch should be warned about a scene that s eerily reminiscent of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting pedigree producer elliott kastner produced harper and the long goodbye co producer arnon milchan co produced the oscar nominated l a confidential and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the medusa touch to be a heavy handed unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury both directed by brian depalma they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter 
__label__1 i saw el mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters ramallo manuel tur and francisca after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension filled movie i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story it s a violent intense and sad story people are expected to suffer to cry to get hurt to bleed and i think that what the film shows isn t done for pure shock value or presented in a distasteful way i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work this is one of those movies and a great movie it is the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren t 100 clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense but it wasn t anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9 
__label__1 the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor it has a deeper plot better character development and the tunes especially the closing song are both catchy and warm hearted sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on it is a care bears movie this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship love and again caring not to mention the care bears are just too adorable 
__label__0 i m sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director over uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point blank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet those bazookas need serious site calibration 
__label__1 okay that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it receives the camera work is splendid best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast minus the helpless victims is strong what i don t like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained why does it change sex what s the purpose and they re aliens what kind why were they never shown again in the later mythology i m giving this episode a high three stars one of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me still not gonna let it ruin my entertainment 
__label__0 i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don t remember or possibly blocked them out who knows if i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye 
__label__1 this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other it should have managed a wider distribution as it s much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time the swimming instructor is an almost olympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students he attempts more or less to fend them off with varying results the students characters are mainstream u s a teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom haven t learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys this is a good date movie or just one to watch when you re in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality 
__label__1 in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about i usually smile and say life they shrug and probably never give it another thought the fact that everyone from every background can relate to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing definately a must see for everyone 
__label__0 simply awful slasher molded from the i know what you did last summer type of fodder has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a florida condo being murdered one by one a misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see decimated as quick as possible del tenney the curse of the living corpse i eat your skin of all people executive produced co wrote and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer i guess means something to why he s psychotic the revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective probably not surprising a soul who watches it there are a lot of attempted jump scares with one character popping out to frighten their friend which couldn t even manufacture a few cheap thrills because they are so calculated in such a tepid way most of the attacks occur off screen with bleeding throat cuts or pools representing the only real display of violence the protracted finale where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible is embarrassing and tense less there s not one single positive to derive from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one dimensional roles and for pity sake they could ve at least allowed us to see joey lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes dorie barton as the heroine final girl beth morgan who the killer seems to be obsessed with couldn t be more vacuous and uninteresting oh she was in rehab and takes pills for her nightmares such intriguing exposition chad allen cast against type as a very intimidating friend of the group who happens to disappear from the film first setting up the idea that he s the first victim has a tough hill to climb with his role so steep he eventually stumbles rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight jeff conaway needing some cash i guess has the beleaguered fbi agent role whose daughter s murder motivates him to seek out the killer leading him to florida jack mcgee has his usual a hole role as a smart mouth florida police chief who is often nose to nose with conaway s agent oh the answer to the title s question not really because once you get the answer you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway 
__label__0 at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie i though that will be great but it wasn t is a bad copy of the richard donner work lex is again a villain that makes no more else even played by kevin spice the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forced the script is predictable and simple all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady the story is the wrong thing it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy all read you later
__label__0 early film directed by d w griffith it features a gloriously happy king arthur v johnson and his queen marion leonard but wait when the king leaves the scene his queen makes music with the palace s minstrel henry b walthall when the king discovers the lovers he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe type revenge it s difficult to believe the lovers can t hear those plotting against them although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy the lovers and quiet the cement mixers the sets make the sealed room look very staged the performances are okay and the story is easy to follow the sealed room 9 2 09 d w griffith arthur v johnson henry b walthall marion leonard
__label__0 i did not expect much from this film but boy o boy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you can t get the feeling that his caracter is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if it s drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they don t show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh 
__label__1 tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back even if that means killing tarzan this is a rarity a sequel that s better than the original tarzan the ape man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult there is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blank and no one really cares but this was 1934 there s also plenty of blood gore and violence for a 1934 movie and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude there s also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and it s implied they sleep together and have sex without being married this wouldn t bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme that aside the movie is well directed very fast moving and full of adventure and excitement seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane s outfit is pretty revealing too i still think maureen o sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan everybody else is ok this is easily the best weismuller o hara tarzan out there well worth seeing but not for kids 
__label__1 after having watched guinea pig two questions come in mind besides am i really a psychopath to watch that is it a snuff the answer is no although it s the closest thing to a snuff movie i ve ever seen and then where the hell have they found that girl because she gets tortured for 45 min without any reasons given in fact there is nothing else in this movie fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots and many more until the final scene i m still not sure how they did that because it belongs to the japonese underground scene it s obvious she didn t get a lot of money so what were her their motivations i saw it in japonese without subtitles but it s not a problem no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes i haven t seen yet all the serial but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one still i ve rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ask charlie sheen the actor but i think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones another movie i m hiding from my parents 8 10
__label__0 as far as the movie goes it s an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said it s not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched as for calling this another cube movie is utter and complete bullsh t this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of people androids as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch i gave this a 3 because of the backstabbing of the original this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all watchable for those who have not seen cube hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series 
__label__0 sure it had some of the makings of a good film the storyline is good if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn t understand why olivia d abo had such a pronounced australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us my biggest problem however was with the wardrobe i know as rule the average american is considered a frumpy dresser by any self respecting european but this was beyond that anna s colour combinations were positively ghastly and that potato sack like sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible how many school teachers walk around in prada but simple doesn t mean an absolute lack of taste a word to the wise 
__label__0 we laughed our heads off this script is so incredible you either zap to cnn or go to sleep my dad was a sea captain for 30 years he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie during his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey daily and sorry s t on his desk of course this was not on a nuclear mission for instance the fire in the kitchen fire is the most important thing on any ship nuclear or not to give a drill at that time is just hollywood script when a captain is put under arrest he is under arrest you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept this is stored within minutes in a well guarded room he cannot escape it s just like in prison funny thing is my dad also had a dog on board however we see how hackman let him pee in the control room this is not done ever my dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was hackman and washington make the three stars this movie is credited for all the rest is bulls t when we do know that 23 people were still alive on the koersk this film gets an extra dimension if you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent thas boat 
__label__1 if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett then this is probably not the film for you the famed boxer receives a 1940s hollywood ization of his life making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life however because the performances were so good particularly by errol flynn and the script so likable the film s embellishments can be forgiven errol flynn plays gay nineties era boxer james gentleman jim corbett a man who became world boxing champ in 1892 the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l sullivan however while it could have focused mostly on the matches most are rather brief in the film except for the final title match and the emphasis is on corbett s brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith throughout the film there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films alan hale and the writing really helped bring these people alive what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer while a few of the shots are of doubles almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist this was a nice departure for flynn who generally played pretty boy roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was to find out more about this try reading a biography of him he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood now as for the real james corbett read on if you aren t afraid of finding out how the movie isn t accurate first corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family but was college educated and bright second while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film they also divorced a few years later third the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened in reality sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat headed guy they portrayed in the film though it made for a lovely film 
__label__0 this movie was terrible i thought with all the some what decent actors it would be better don t waste your time eva longoria parker was awful she should stick to desperate housewives paul rudd is becoming a b actor the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i m saying and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons watch just like heaven with reese witherspoon it was a tad better or any other ghost movie you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time ps i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it 
__label__1 if you like jamie foxx alvin sanders date from hell 01 you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp jumbo size and at the same time lots of gold bars alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw and david morse edgar clenteen hack 02 tv series decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals there is lots of laughs drama cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture 
__label__0 if you haven t seen zombie bloodbath you haven t a contest like make your own horror movie in one day could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer s intelligence mr sheets forgot a story a plot proper dialog the fact that people need some basic acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up it seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams and copied on even worse equipment make up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people s heads in order to simulate their skin melting this is nothing more than a home movie and a really bad one as well only fun to watch for the friends familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming i cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious film magazine or website i have home movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting a total waste of time money and energy the sequel zombie bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish 
__label__1 i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap crap pardon the pun what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams blokes as well even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark 
__label__0 first ifc runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip off is that town and country was watchable this isn t i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else s dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy doing a z grade dom deluise was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts the real crime besides this being green lighted is shepherd s character a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half million bucks if you buy that i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in 
__label__1 in my line of work i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film when i can i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs once in a while though there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible the short film b r o k e n directed by alex ferrari is a genuine surprise and worth a second look clocking in at a scant 20 minutes b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home when she awakes she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book these nasty guys and girls are larger than life they are all guns and knives there is no way out the kicker here is that despite being a low budget film it doesn t play like one from the very beginning the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot edited and produced by professionals it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers the film is sharp and cool it looks good and it feels like something big the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer duncan were well chosen as two of the few speaking roles in the film it is up to them to carry the film no special effects no matter how good would have saved this film from bad acting thankfully polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent but it hardly shows the downside to b r o k e n is that it s only 20 minutes long the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle watching it i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop but it comes off as unsatisfying i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film my rating 8 out of 10 
__label__0 the film had some likable aspects perhaps too many for my taste it felt as though the writer director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters not once a few times but all of the time this is the job of television not cinema the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler s performance as the pregnant friend i felt as though justine clarke s performance was wan her reactions to things felt forced as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist s expressions i also can t believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences this is a lazy device especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest that said there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity infusing it with passion and hand crafted charm i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked who knows if there s a god like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife i m giving up smoking an anti smoking commercial a tac ad with some tasteful animation i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark it was all too much 
__label__1 not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary but clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition we should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment but didn t we say this of 1984 had james orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after 1984 in fact it was in 1994 he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did hindsight rewarded it doesn t matter what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a love apple when necessity knocks at our door a snapshot of ourselves at old age whatever the time line will prove to be for us i know for a fact we haven t seen the beginning of it yet 
__label__0 when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes sadly the title is about as funny as it gets led by detective dick mason a special team of military and scientists including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of b movies in particular japanese horror of the 1950 s the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady and let me tell you it doesn t get any saner as the film progresses to be fair there are a couple of funny moments for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes hey can somebody please pass the ketchup equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept unfortunately for attack of the killer tomatoes spoof films such as the airplane and naked gun series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since the acting is atrocious there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once one gag after the over the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre even for this film ultimately however you can see why this film is a cult one i can t see many people being indifferent to it unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up 
__label__0 it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to pekinpah fans has the inter cutting between man and animal but here we have non diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the perps caan and duval travel to their next mission duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalma s dressed to kill at the short lived expense of angle dickenson the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what i m talking about i use pekinpah s credits as supplementary lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off 
__label__0 jack black s character tim dingman the dreamer in envy finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray vapoorize that when sprayed on doggie dung makes the poo disappear into thin air for a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this stinker of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past 12 months that honor goes to the cat in the hat it does get the honor of a close second not funny not sad not anything a real stinkeroo a 0 2 out of 10 
__label__1 i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then it s become one of my favorites the plot isn t particularly complex but it doesn t take away from the entertainment it s chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda blythen she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if you re looking for a good comedy i d definately recommend this movie 
__label__0 this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand ri chard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro it s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it s just so weird this could be a great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction 
__label__0 i suppose many people comment review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible i m writing due to the latter i was excited for the sequel to wargames i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content i felt it was worth watching more than once this being 2008 i had high hopes for what they would do with this film computers gaming terror military over zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film and wargames the dead code had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick the movie failed on pretty much every level but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects the dead code was a 1990 s air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms meanwhile will farmer is button mashing about 7 000 commands none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen until finally he wins by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20 000 virtual people nobody is near the gas because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes this tells ripley the real life war machine that he is a high level terror threat even though any 5 16 year old could complete this same task the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity they say things like he has expert knowledge of bio terror he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio terror so then a movie long chase scene with about 01 of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter sometimes they are mad they barely miss him but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him ugh i would write more but i already wasted 1 5 hours watching this i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic tac toe for 1 5 hours 
__label__1 this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would be librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don t usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course 
__label__0 this movie sucked it really was a waste of my life the acting was atrocious the plot completely implausible long long story short these people get terrorized by this pathetic crazed killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip with no gear and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that they re stuck in the woods but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them like i said this movie sucks a complete joke don t let your girlfriend talk you into watching it 
__label__1 an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues director shumlin theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration for the female character in a 40s thriller the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly paedophiliac brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical metaphors a rare approximation of greene s god and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history 
__label__0 grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide julie pyke cheri christian blames husband allen greg thompson for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it julie remains in a zombie state eliciting next to no emotion remote and numb only photographing a nearby abandoned prison finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell though allen doesn t see anything out of the ordinary julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn t quite right a local handyman jim payne scott hodges a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the pykes meanwhile the neighbors who sold the pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well alcoholic mr booth s abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin attempting to unravel the mystery about the place plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable cheri christian remains so vacuous and lost it s incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight the acting as is often mentioned remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to i guess it s supposed to be this way under their circumstances but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the pykes due to their constant state of aloofness cheri comes off as cold and detached as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could i think the right performers even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil can grab the hearts of their viewers if a humanity reaches out to us in this movie s case the leads are unable to do so for whatever reason it could ve been me i don t know i wanted to care for them but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings anyway as the film continues allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won t lose her little girl again jim the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the pykes becomes a vital threat the ghosts remain a central part of the movie their presence particularly jim s mother established throughout off in the distance the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart jim s mission i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters 
__label__1 i m not sure how i missed this one when it first came out but i am glad to have finally seen it this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho japan it tells the tale of prostitution caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan it is uniquely akira kurosawa even though he died before he could direct this movie his adaptation of the screenplay shows his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other the characters may revolve around each other but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute s world goes back to his life while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system lowest of the low many prize the world of the samurai above all others but yet it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones the movie deserves a higher rating it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan during this time frame men were thought to be the survivors the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it has i recommend the sea is watching to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if they re not a fan it is a lovely quiet and soul sustaining movie and one to be treasured for any movie collection 
__label__1 this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time wonderful animation and adorable characters even the bad guys were cute made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with i still want to see it again but haven t had time better than toy story which was good too but not this good 
__label__1 valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good marley shelton did great as the female lead much better than jennifer love hewitt in the i know films david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene all in all it s a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again 
__label__0 although this isn t a great film there s something compelling and memorable about it like another commenter on the film i saw this in childhood it s been thirty three years since 1952 but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title see it if you have the opportunity you ll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades more than any other film this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century progress it s engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one furthermore it s easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time 
__label__0 why this was an insipid uninspired and embarrassing film the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it pittsburgh pa why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie there when this movie was originally to be released it was more of a romantic comedy and no robo anything that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney why they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either sheesh 
__label__1 i never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie i will probably see many times this film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie it was as if i was looking at paintings many times which i think was the idea terrific movie story actors and cinematography full of profound emotions from every angle although i am not particularly fond of romance movies i loved this and was deeply moved by winona ryder s plea to her father toward the end mr irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never better 
__label__0 every once in a while someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks what s with snitch d i know immediately they have a case of barely hidden amusement horror you see i was the cinematographer on the film let me clarify some points regarding this interesting life experience originally snitch d was called one hard hit i met james cahill in july of 1999 a day after i wrapped triangle square a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag s notorious experimental feature contract but i digress i though i was on a roll and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about 25 000 not wanting to break pace i took it after all clerks el mariachi i too believed the myth back then let s just chalk it up as film school for many involved myself included snitch d was shot over two weeks in august 1999 in aliso viejo and santa ana ca cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city yes he is a drama and english teacher consider that while watching the film or even observing the use of apostrophe in title hence the locations and cast of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l a s channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez and of greater impact the debut of eva longoria who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt i must say her professional dedication focus and let s do this attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom yet to come snitch d suffered from poor optics few lights or electricity several boom operators du jour and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication none of that overshadows the actual content which speaks for itself anyway by 2003 the film was sold to distributors at a net loss i understand who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box by then she was a rising working name but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch d since cahill s other passion is antiquarian book dealing it appears to confirm he believes you can in fact judge a book by it s cover as so many have picked up this dvd based on it s sleeve one year later eva now on a soap and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted split second which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent 6 years later i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez mexico i though he had worked out the process my participation was contingent on casting script and crew control and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies for what it was a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez despite claims here and elsewhere the film has never appeared in any festival or venue although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject virgin of juarez and border town 
__label__1  pandora s clock is a gripping suspense thriller that s a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film this movie which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996 is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease the u s government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not while the pilot richard dean anderson and a virus expert daphne zuniga try to figure something out to avoid disaster i m not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries but i liked pandora s clock it s one heck of a thrill ride jane leeves tv s frasier robert loggia and edward herrmann as the president also star out of four 
__label__1 okay yes this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast y ain t that fast 
__label__0 i kind of feel like a genius i feel like i m the only one who saw through this fake film i watched it three times once with commentary and i found myself getting annoyed at all the close ups all the times the screen just blacks out and worst of all i feel the film never really resolves anything yes the priest dies but he didn t really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief or with himself that and he was an idiot if it weren t for the commentary by peter cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from i wouldn t have been able to stomach it at all i enjoy french movies but this is one that was completely absurd diary of a country priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe scene after scene of extreme close ups where characters don t say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do not make an interesting or relevant story how this film ever became a classic is mind boggling it reminds me more of the emperor s new clothes yes claude laydu s performance is heartfelt and thought provoking if you are a sadist but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the catholic priesthood which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption the young priest s triumph over the countess s pride is a weak scene but 90 of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest s melancholy thoughts this priest doesn t come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful being that i don t speak or understand french i was looking forward to doing the english subtitle thing to help understand the film well the english subtitle is at times impossible to view read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much i could not read and i am not a particularly slow reader i just finished dostoyevsky in 3 days i really wanted to like this film i try out everything chosen by the criterion collection and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod however i sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character and it never materialized he just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter and for that i say it stunk 
__label__1 very few so called remakes can be as good as the originals this one crosses that border with flying colors just a remake i don t think so i saw it theatrically at the age of nine and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film this update is more epic and cinematic still i thoroughly recommend both films this film is certainly a must see for an animal lover we have the wise old golden retriever shadow the sharp sarcastic himalayan cat sassy and the young fun loving american bulldog chance the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche sally field and michael j fox respectively there is virtually nothing offensive in the film there is a bit of scatological humor but nothing extreme no hard violence save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall an angry porcupine and a dark railroad shaft hilarious scary moving and above all real it surprised me to see that this film didn t win any awards not one nevertheless i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays 
__label__1 i loved this movie i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan but i really enjoyed myself the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going this is a bit of a departure for disney they don t spend quite as much time on character development my husband pointed this out and there are no musical numbers it is strictly action adventure i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney be they young or old 
__label__1 i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was made into a monster by society suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got but it was a happy surprise my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic the fact that the male lead isn t bad to look at surely helped and there was enough plot development action and even humor the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other s name had the whole movietheatre laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story so in short not what i expected but a very good surprise indeed i ll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd 
__label__0 i found the dvd version of this movie at a rummage sale the basic premise is an affair between a teacher coach a student the acting is weak and the plot razor thin this movie had all the depth and plot development of an adult film 
__label__0 if you re going to look after a child make sure they don t live anywhere near a graveyard especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her friends but our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs shacks up with her family the nortons which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast s tendency to talk even when their lips aren t moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths but enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won t shut up during any scene even the quiet ones oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on in fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather smelt what they d signed up for and gone awol yes i know it s hard to get into movies these days but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you d want if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett and another almost equally as bad by the charisma free child actress rosalie cole the next dakota fanning she ain t the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on but back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it so do they stay where they are safe no of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she s having a nervous breakdown finally the film closes it doesn t end it just goes to a grinding halt the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened but my dear viewer something horrible has happened you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained boring horror films you re ever likely to see and lost 82 minutes of your life you ll never get back just think years from now on your deathbed what you d trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family sadly it s already too late for me don t you make the same mistake 2 10:(
__label__1 this was a great movie even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great my friend and i laughed a lot my mom even enjoyed it there was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol and when she gets her roadster and ned is there yeah this was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol go see it i bet you ll enjoy it i really enjoyed it and so did my friend people were so tough on this movie and they hadn t even seen it i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance they all did a great job in my opinion but if you have young kids its still appropriate i will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too

__label__1 this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t v that i wished i d captured forever on vhs won t it ever air again it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i can t have not even on ebay so having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the 80 s put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it sob it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could 
__label__1 this is one of my favorite mr motos and i have seen them all as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr moto lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator the usual comic relief is quite funny here and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye it s fast paced and fun the archaeologist doesn t have quite the same flair as thomas beck the usual second lead in these programmers but he s adequate stepin fetchit is on board and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny not demeaning to his intelligence and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen 
__label__0 shown in australia as hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden the infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of total recall there didn t seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money 
__label__1 here s one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox the movie presents the story of star crossed lovers one israeli one palestinian in modern tel aviv the film s effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross ethnic conflict but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well for example there s a telling moment when one of the secondary characters openly gay is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room clearly the young man is not as open as he seems and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be while the boyfriend is confused and rejected a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment as we know from yossi jagger fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences the film is also effective for the even handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other if you re not heartless you ll cry through the last third of the movie though the plot is melodramatic it s so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be 
__label__1 not a bad word to say about this film really i wasn t initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can t see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book i ve noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer s p o v shot and i ask what s wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer s identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist killer revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people believe me 
__label__1 it s not too bad a b movie with sanders barrie hale cowen hamilton gargan fitzgerald and even willie best we could be either with charlie chan moto the falcon blackie holmes or the saint etc in other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends from plain to urbane murdering and being murdered always a pleasure in my book barrie s a hard boiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father a police detective by planning and carrying out with her coterie a string of underworld assassinations which would surely have had the opposite effect sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer at the right time and killing him the story and acting s ok the only gripe i ve got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius waldeman was did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot that said a solid entry in the series 
__label__1 i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13 1974 i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle hey where s the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level when darren mcgavin s carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations he reacts like most people would he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode it s rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force he s usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are in one episode he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself he s heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn t do but that doesn t mean he probably wouldn t much rather someone else did it instead of him he s a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monster hunter he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesn t want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do if his plan to defeat the creature didn t work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what i would do in the situation that s why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him you were scared for him and for the other characters too the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it s all for naught if you don t care about the characters darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but as an adult i can see why it couldn t go on in that formula for very long i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling determined and brusk but good hearted reporter for the ins known as carl kolchak i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show it s not the monsters darkly lit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients the secret to it s success is right there in the title kolchak the night stalker without mcgavin s lovable bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just ain t a night stalker 
__label__0  and ethel merman buffs too will love her loud bossy vocals as the wicked witch mombi but this cartoon sequel to the wizard of oz is bereft of real imagination substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video little dorothy is whisked back to oz which has gone to ruin and meets old and new friends the inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less inspired shows from hanna barbera however many of the songs are good particularly dorothy s sweet lament it s a far away land superbly performed by liza minnelli you can count on minnelli for energy which is why the movie perks up whenever dorothy is around much of it is unmemorable and i m not even sure baby boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long as a curiosity item just fair from 
__label__0 slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember choose life 
__label__0 the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are greydon clark and if they are both there run for your life however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously it starts out bad and goes downhill from there repeated scenes the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter yes he s the best deputy sheriff in texas tracking a mafia hit man to malta as only he can he makes his own rules does things his own way all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style you want to see a bad but funny film go ahead on its your move 
__label__1 this film is one of the best of all time certainly in the horror genre the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be actors are fantastic rip donald pleasance you were fantastic as dr loomis he made the film even better without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house which of course is one of the films best scenes she gives a tremendous performance i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80 s and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this death at any turn halloween of course shows this in it s most terrifying way horror should be believable and that is what makes the film enjoyable it s just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere as well as psycho s superb storyline both of which i adore i believe there formats are the best horror has to offer to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time 
__label__0 this film was totally not what i expected if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two its really strange because i cannot see the point the prequel and sequel lets just say don t make sense the don t even match maybe i am naive but ain t a vol 1 vol 2 meant to match up carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original and in the prequel he lives and don t go jail the plot was ok but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film i really expected it to end like the other one started if some one has a opinion on this post it please 
__label__1 i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless he she is a critic or a person who analyzes story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office school it makes you laugh and it is not just humor yes the tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later on another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those jesse s talks with michelle are extremely touching if one doesn t think of it as childish overall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows 
__label__0 hanna barbera sucks the life out of another famous property the violence is watered down the stories are formulaic the animation is bad the music is obnoxious and repetitive and frankly the show just isn t funny at the time h b put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not thus popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen hey popeye is popular and the flinstones are popular put em together and you can t miss also in an apparent ripoff of private benjamin olive oyl and the goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits seriously why adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode standard practice at the time for cartoons but still annoying popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely recycling and are you ready for this the dangers of smoking i swear i m not making that up the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack mercer the voice of popeye from the early days continues the role here worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old fleischer shorts otherwise avoid at all costs 
__label__1 i saw this at the theater in the early 1970 s the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or hoof with eerie protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks only and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers the gas clouds move ever closer finally enveloping the british defenders the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb suddenly a scream from the defenders this gas is like no other that they have experienced before now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver i think that you will too

__label__1 this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it all you have to do is read all the positive comments not a single negative that i can see to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that s just so unbelievable what a bunch of headless overpaid suited turkeys there must have been or just maybe still are running around to do that 
__label__0 i watched free money last night it was the longest 90 minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i m a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent it s almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle prod scene there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups why didn t they show charlie sheen s character going back to tow brando s truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasn t buying into it skip this one only for die hard brando fans i m giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo 
__label__1 i think that this movie was reasonbaly good it s kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house anyway the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names it s just kind of an older version of it takes two 
__label__0 this movie forever left an impression on me i watched it as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the brady bunch i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil however this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a volunteer in the women s state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives one at a time what fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they didn t see it 
__label__1 by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynn s hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually adventures of don juan 1948 but it also proved to be his last big budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the little seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways albeit for a modestly budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady maureen o hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 a viewing of which preceded this one against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie i ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the child like indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the king s pirate 1967 with doug mcclure for what it s worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer s girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald o connor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk s mutiny 1952 the afore mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961

__label__0 one can deal with historical inaccuracies but this film was just too much practically nothing was even close to truth and even for the era it was seen as silly in defense of ford it was revealed on an old talk show that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real wyatt earp who was obviously old senile and replayed the scene his own way earp told the director about the stagecoach and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival so despite what other historians claim wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated this movie portrays earp as an honest man and also his brothers history doesn t exactly say they were or weren t most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters but that is nothing new the truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of gunfight at the ok corral men who saw it as a career and believe me in the old west you didn t have time to think about too much else characters that don t exist characters depicted dying at the corral who really didn t all make this a weaker film it is further weakened by mature who really didn t make a convincing doc he may be the worst cast choice ever for doc but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth after all ford did get information first hand from wyatt earp it is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the mexican girl hollywood was very pro nazi in those days and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to hitler idealism this occurs in most movies until the eighties it is no excuse and does cheapen the art however the actors who play the earps do well and brennan is always a thrill in fact mature may be the only acting downside of this flick still it is the weakest of the old ok corral movies 
__label__0 i rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt complied to night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seen there was nothing happening in this film what so ever i didn t care for any of the characters didn t buy in to the whole mystery type plot didn t care how it ended nothing there is no comedy no action no thrills no suspense nothing the highlights include no spoilers there s nothing to spoil a man climbing through a window a dog barking outside a hotel room a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it s horn i really enjoyed one hour photo and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams but alas was sorely let down what s more disappointing is that i m sure there is a good film in there somewhere the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters but it just didn t work for me i might even have given it 1 10 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers
__label__1 holes the novel was forced on me in an education course i didn t think i would like a children s novel plus the other couple of books i was forced to read for the class were really bad but to my surprise i absolutely loved holes it really is one of the most perfectly written novels i ve ever read i think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre teens teenagers and adults everyone who reads it i think will walk away a better person while i can t quite say that for the film i am happy to say that they got it mostly right i don t think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched but they will certainly be entertained without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down it is an intelligent story and it s very well told i think it moves a tad too quickly the novel takes more time in developing the characters and the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don t have too much time to register the interracial romance in the past feels more cliché and trite than it does in the novel and the ending which ties together all the loose threads seems very ridiculous it s exactly the same in the novel but there s a sense of the absurd that doesn t quite exist in the film it works a lot better i also don t like the multitude of pop songs i wish disney didn t feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks the cast is across the board excellent from the young kids to the old pros jon voight is especially great not quite sure why we need catwoman and the fonze though 9 10 
__label__1 this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters just about every voluptuous middle aged female in hollywood and a touching funny love story the capomezza s and the malacici s are rival caterers in an italian neighborhood in new york they are also at opposite extreme ends of the taste scale their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet naturally they fall in love on stage the mayhem and confusion that this causes as the parents feud with each other and their kids is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezza s magnificently tasteless home and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings besides the four over the top parents and the charming young lovers the characters include a vaguely wise priest a plain speaking grandma a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed roscoe a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car and two doves there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn t click in this fast paced movie even the family names of the two families are part of the fun capomezza could be interpreted as low brows and malacici could mean stuck up snobs if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes you may not like this movie if bette midler embarrasses you you may not like it because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart the rest of us should love it 
__label__1 what would you expect from a film titled surviving christmas and presented as festive fun something like ghandi or english patient there are lots of things i love about this film it s funny it is very well cast and it is superbly written i came to the film as a kaplan elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot it sounded ridiculous but the film doesn t come across like that because affleck as drew latham plays his part perfectly one minute a child like adult the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants in fact we see latham grow up in this film when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good he sees that his own lot is not so bad this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama it either works or it doesn t and very few comedy writers get it correct every time i particularly loved the drama scene where the family take to reading parts written by latham the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco james gandolfini and the comments of brian valco josh zuckerman it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well the addition of daughter alicia christina applegate into the story brings a delightful romantic angle and why not in a christmas film of course its corny and contrived he s rich and handsome she s beautiful and single and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face great one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can t really complain i got what i wanted 
__label__0 ho hum an inventor s horst buchholz deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands unknowingly his son luke perry has been working on the antedote all along enter cia agent olivia d abo and the cat and mouse car chases and gunfire begins also in the cast are tom conti hendrick haese and an aging roger moore moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts perry fans will be accepting d abo is wrong for the role but nice to look at 
__label__1 this movie was hysterical i haven t laughed this hard in a long time i mean it s not good will hunting but was it supposed to be i actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised the comedy hits hard and is fairly constant amanda peet is hot and awesome the entire audience that i screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as i did 
__label__1 there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing it s authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boy s harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of william s more serious performances 
__label__1 i m an admirer of hal hartley s films especially 1997 s henry fool fay grim is a sequel to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor the plot however is completely different fay grim played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey tries to track down her missing husband s notebooks and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage the supporting cast most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum saffron burrows and a much welcomed return from 90s indie darling elina lowensohn is excellent and the film has lots of surprises the director claims this is part of a star wars like trilogy serving as the empire strikes back of the series if this is true i can t wait to see the third installment i just hope i don t have to wait 10 more years for it 
__label__0 i d give it a 2 10 i was really really disappointed the storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out i thought brenda song did a fine job but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role i could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where chinese elements were needed too the villain for example his physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something out of the chinese culture the final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the show others may point out that this is a kid s show and hence there is no need for the such high standards however there are other disney shows such as mu lan which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation in conclusion i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on 
__label__1 was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming went to the premier in london and had a great chat to phil peter martin and jon as did my wife fantastic after party too then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club what a brilliant film it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films now we have the dvd sue my wife can t get enough of it neither can the kids get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think i m a film star now oh well one can only dream i think they are just jealous the only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather rain rain and more rain but hey we was in wales hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted jon danny beck
__label__0 mirror mirror 1990 is a flat out lame movie why did i watch movies like this when i was younger who knows maybe i was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another i don t know i guess i needed a hobby during my teen years a teenage outcast rainbow harvest seeks solace in an old mirror soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her movies like these the power giver has a nasty side effect this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not a mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d v d a few years back i don t know why they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust people love this movie foe some reason if you do i would like to know why until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it again not recommended at all 
__label__0 why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over again this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years i obviously wasn t embracing my inner masochist as bucatinsky s writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom more character development would have been helpful we are never acquainted with eli s masochism in fact we are led to believe that he is not a masochist although tom s psycho emotional sadism is highly evident 
__label__1 will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets let s give you 30 000 to make a movie and see what you come up with the guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free sure the acting is laughable at times yes the make up is not greatest you ll ever see but it s not the worst either if you want to see that go watch zombie nation with it s raccoon zombies this is pure good old fashioned guerilla film making todd is a consummate professional and an all around nice guy there are holes in the plot yes the plot does seem far fetched but what the hell i still love this movie i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to if anyone has ever tried to make a movie they know that just finishing it is an achievement in and of itself 
__label__0 first and foremost zorie barber zeke might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character that s supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper over dramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director don t the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen it already gross out humor hand in toilet trainspotting masturbation hmm fast times at ridgemont high american pie the list goes on bad dialogue in one sequence eric says it s none of my business but and 30 seconds later mia says why is this any of your business bad editing at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots it s also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight knit group of friends in any world i can t comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy low brow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see boomerang if you want a solid what goes around romantic comedy go for the tao of steve but anyone who thinks whipped is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all 
__label__0 bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for 2 i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one the movie is quite cliche 1970 s and is quite groovy for that unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie in fact i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was the movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and wait for them if you are into b movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did i mention not much story line either 
__label__0 a female country singer nicknamed big t seriously that s what they call her risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard busey who wants to be her manager his mother committed suicide his father s an alcoholic as well and he has a violent temper you can imagine where that leads in the meantime there s music aplenty as parton with her fluid vocal talents belts out song after song at least half a dozen of them about texas steer clear of this mess and check her out in nine to five or steel magnolias instead 
__label__1 ever since i can remember and i m only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey don t get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the 40s and 50s anyways now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed the children did not act like children in the slightest but there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence so people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see paul lukas dear paul did an amazing job now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn t but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way but lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone d:D
__label__0 when this movie was released it spawned one of the all time great capsule movie reviews sphinx stinks it does but in a mesmerizing sort of way the casting is silly starting at the top frank langella and sir john gielgud as egyptians not enough makeup in cairo for that at least not while this film was being made but it s rather amusing to see them try the performances run the gamut from mummy like sorry the obvious observation to over the top with very few stops in between the lesley anne down character seems as though she couldn t find egypt on a map much less expound upon its archaeological treasures that s due at least in part to some really bad writing one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie it s my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric such as egyptology are ripe for silly overwritten dialogue it doesn t disappoint and the convergence proves a double whammy the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension can this get dumber and less believable the answer is usually yes the location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good the only consistent reminders that this wasn t some low budget production that and the fact that there are so many well known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher cheap no cheesy yes 
__label__0 consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll somewhere perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said you don t talk about at parties boll knows that david lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him gore whores metal heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the teutonic helmsman s output so bereft of originality wit or imagination that he s become the internet s bogeyman an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement boll does his best to ride over these naysayers exploiting tax credits available in germany and canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as zero mostel did with old ladies in the producers the difference being that mostel s character knew he was making bowel fill maybe uwe knows it too such is the level of hostility toward each new bollbuster that imdb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they ve seen it boll s attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined indeed he s probably the only filmmaker that s boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage this onslaught has made uwe a very thick skinned man so much so that he must feel like he s wrapped in a carpet but one who feels as if he s bullied by the entire world like most people in that situation he lashes out determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding variety s review of house of the dead never too far from the surface this i know you are but what am i strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of postal which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9 11 christian fundamentalism jihad nazism and paedophilia such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of peter cook and the visual imagination of chris morris but the closest boll gets to either man is the o in their surname in seed shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer is there any other kind who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free though if you d been fried with that much electricity why would you want to they pronounce him legally dead and bury him only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers boll begins his exploration of nihilistic rage with seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes from there we re treated to the killer s stock in trade kidnapping dogs babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food we re invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition yes we re worthless gormless sadists and worse than that we won t give uwe a good rating on the imdb in short humanity is bunk of course you might think that uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it s a bit of a bipolar piece on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness the milk that poor old boll has had to drink for so long while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth the result says nothing about society and its discontents more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director poor uwe is obviously a very angry man one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy s about dispatching various web critics that it s there but takes an avant garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread shows that boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements he s made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate i wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun boll told the audience at the film s world premiere and he has on that flimsy manifesto succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director s detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker he ll need something genuine to say as well as a better more original way of saying it 
__label__1 pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king s creepy story pretty well most people may avoid this but they should check it out 
__label__1 twisted bizarre enchanting and hilarious i couldn t stop laughing watching this film darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980 s it s an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera manipulation is a strong word however don t we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another from the beginning i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible later darren comments about his budding homosexuality and you can see it from the hints big hints of flamboyance at an early age maybe it was just the warm southern california weather who knows as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment it s great to see that his parents supported and loved him and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens put the camera on me offers a look back to the 80 s untouched by commercialism you ll remember the hair the music and the fashions i m the same age as mr stein so the trip back to memory lane was welcome his solo lip syncing dance number is priceless enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t shirt the films deal with dark themes at time child abuse the holocaust nuclear war sexual fantasy and social dysfunction no childhood is completely carefree and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least and hilarious to behold watch at your earliest convenience 
__label__1 bette davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as mildred rogers in this 1934 film the film seems rather dated now in 2003 it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today it was startling for me to see how young ms davis looks in this move the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting leslie howard is well cast as philip carey the club footed medical student this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why however of human bondage didn t seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally i felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it i have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for you be the judge 
__label__1 this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of it s roots it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis this room hasn t been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville s past not to mention lionels conversations with lex are always admirable another pleasant return is well uv guessed it is bart allen aka impulse ac aka aquaman and victor stone aka cyborg not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie from there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up 33 1 bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and graceful with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season 4 this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark sais at the end we didn t find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10 first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliver s bike rememeber from the arrow episode clark and impulse should have obviously ran and aquaman should have swam via another route but that was soo incredibly cheesy it nocked off 2 points from the full 10 secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow sais let s go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do outweigh the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6 7 out of 10 :)
__label__1 if you a purist don t waste your time otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart granger deborah kerr version i ve seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i won t detail the differences because it would spoil the film also it is a pleasure to see alison doody again i m a huge indiana jones fan patrick swayze is good as quatermain and the supporting cast is superb i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment you won t be disappointed 
__label__0 rock star john norman howard kris kristofferson turns lounge singer esther hoffman barbra streisand into an overnight singing star esther s star rises while john s goes into decline thanks to drugs and alcohol after about two hours john does the self destructive red converible 160 mph crack up on a desert highway thing the best thing about this movie is the music especially the song evergreen barbra streisand sings well but you can t take her seriously as an up and coming star when she is already a star the very first time she appears singing in a back alley bar she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career she is too confident too professional her apartment looks like a page out of apartment living not some hole in the wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live kris kristofferson handles the self centered out of control rock star role like well like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn t have much acting talent the direction is tepid the story is slow and dull but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting or the lame direction or the slow story it s the hair after staring at kristofferson s and streisand s awful 70 s hairdos for 2 hours your eyes hurt 
__label__1 i wasn t a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i m reviewing this movie from a guy s persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it 
__label__1 now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title if you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review anyhow i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately this movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience if you re a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick

__label__1 this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in 1930s canada i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as rudy and awakenings it picks up late in grey owl s life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period the film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over trapped beaver he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earth s resources this is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen the casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd but is not outrageous anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond films i would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama beautiful scenery or environmental causes it is a movie for families as well however children under 10 depending on maturity would have trouble following the plot 
__label__0 well what to say having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was v dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point i had to look away from the screen i was feeling physically sick round and round and round you get the idea very very strange accents at many points those that should know know unless your getting in for free or being paid to watch it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something then forget it 
__label__1 this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine the immortal charles dicken s story has been recreated in every possible way imagine i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i m sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it the story is well known i won t go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another a rich stingy mean old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done george c scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character he is not just a mean old man but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place this is a grand epic of victorian england dickens england is recreated before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery it s not spectacular scenery per se but it s real the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life bob cratchitt played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story a christmas carol is not a light story dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england s life and it s one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it s the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others 10 10
__label__1 i saw this film premiere friday 1 19 night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved sitting in a theater and hearing first hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us robert acosta paul rieckhoff sean huze and herold noel all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film were present while they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be whether you support the war or not it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker see this film 
__label__0 to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor isn t funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls don t watch this movie and don t be fooled by the 5 4 rating because it obviously overrated and doesn t deserve anything above 2 
__label__0 ok look at the title of this film the title says it all right the title is great i mean a lot of things should come into your head after readin it in fact you might be extremely anxious to see it well sadly you won t see any of that just a bunch of bad actors some blood spilling some hot chicks and some lesbo action oh well i think there are about 5 10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed get away from this if you want to see a good movie else get it 
__label__1 william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart s hit broadway play with music recruiting poster vivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman george cukor the women s director has a sure touch on the many documentary like sequences of air corps training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime sure the gee whiz and entirely white save for one unbilled chinese american recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but it s efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring notable too for the all military male cast several of whom didn t reemerge for years lon mcallister edmond o brien martin ritt red buttons in drag as an andrews sister peter lind hayes karl malden kevin mccarthy gary merrill lee j cobb and don taylor also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday who doesn t show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o brien s worried sick brooklyn spouse too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm evidently after twentieth century fox released it to considerable success the rights reverted to the army and if there s a good 35mm print out there it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon it s disingenuous and corny in spots but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen 
__label__1 i m always surprised about how many times you ll see something about world war 2 on the german national television you would think they don t like to open old wounds but there isn t a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war perhaps it s a way of dealing with their past i don t know but you sure can t blame them of ignoring what happened and it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about der untergang or the downfall as you might now it which are also very realistic one of those movies is rosenstrasse it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the usa at the present day after hannah s father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasn t been very religious before she doesn t know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mother s troubled childhood hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother s past the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising for as far as i know there hasn t been another movie that deals with this subject for those who didn t know this yet being married to a so called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they weren t immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrasse the acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didn t really do it for me and that s exactly the only part that you ll get to see in the trailer perhaps it s just me but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day at least of the part that is situated in the usa because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother s past definitely works if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war and if you aren t necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see this isn t a movie in which you ll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of i give it an 8 10 
__label__0 having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 christmases i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr seuss classic tale and well it s not very good first off following a classic act like chuck jones animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavy handed and padded as to be positively numbing i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas jim carrey is typically over the top here but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch as characterised by boris karloff he was a slow burn methodical and sly there is no method to carrey s madness and that is only the most obvious error made talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here why universal why i mean i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman michael caine but this one needs to be filed under films that should never have been made this does not bode well for the cat in the hat an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it and either read the book or watch the tv special this is 2 hours you can never ever get back 
__label__1 i really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more a little soft on the crime front it s almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming will be watching again for sure i m hoping that they ll have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and were somewhat underused this time around the actress who plays the assistant waitress also from bewitched i think is very sweet and bubbly and comes off as nicely dorky and sweet instead of dumb and annoying which is very nice check it out 
__label__1 as a biographical film the lady with red hair the story of how director producer playwright david belasco transformed notorious society divorcee mrs leslie carter into an international stage star is certainly not in a league with that other warner s biopic of similar vintage yankee doodle dandy what is but lady is an enjoyable film in its own right and shares quite a few traits in common with the cagney classic like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair brims over with old time show business flavor among other things both films feature delicious theatrical boarding house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers offices also in lady as in the cohan biopic the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period all doing the sort of top notch work we remember them for need i add that again like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair doesn t let the truth get in the way of telling a good story but also like dandy lady does manage gloriously to convey the esssence of its show business giant hero s larger than life personality everyone knows that cagney limned cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in yankee doodle dandy but few moviegoers realize that claude rains did a similar service for david belasco in the lady with red hair and did it with a panache that almost equals cagney s rains as belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman s galvanic personality in all its outsized glory rains gives a tremendously enjoyable superbly observed and remarkably true to life performance as the man all broadway once called the wizard to watch claude rains in action looking in every shot as if he s having a helluva good time in the lady with red hair is to see david belasco leap to life on film as if he can t wait to shake things up on the main stem once again 
__label__0 i can t believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes it s as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn t seem to condemn these assaults as in the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions and neither does anyone else one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him but he is reprimanded only with you cannot force a woman to love you rather than you should never force a woman sexually you jerk from a woman s point of view the movie is a let down it sort of throws a bone to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders but the movie is much more defined by the romance which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power with men dominating the woman they love this amazing martial arts fighter doesn t use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers she never even makes them apologize rather she seems apologetic overall a depressing and upsetting movie with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes but not as good as hero by a long shot 
__label__0 another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930 s resurrected by the magic of dvd starring stock universal player lionel atwill often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket one kills the victims stockbrokers involved in a scam and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proved innocent because he could not have spoken to witnesses of course where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness wouldn t they both be deaf oh well atwill does a pretty good job here faking being deaf and mute unfortunately no one else here can really act worth a darn 
__label__0 this movie was so terrible it was almost good almost we love musicals but not this one even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can t sing or dance anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance especially toward the end the character marjorie a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music admittadly some of the songs fantabulous are pretty catchy but not in a good way open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful we think it might be a good stage musical with excellent actors 
__label__1 on the surface this is an above average post war romantic comedy beneath the veneer it is mgm character actor stunt casting at its funniest the leads are straightforward but all the secondaries are cast much against type margaret hamilton aka wicked witch of the west edward everett horton professional obsessive compulsive fussbudget and sig ruman the marx brothers nemesis in _night in casablanca_ and the always wonderful _night at the opera_ playing a well intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together instead of driving them apart as their usual characters would do it also pokes fun at many romantic comedy conventions which is another indication that this could be not so much a straight romantic comedy as it is a wry send up of the many post war romantic comedies their 2 dimensional stock characters i ve seen it only once with interruptions so i can t be positive but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made but is less successful now that viewers see these secondary characters through a completely different lens i m assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars i thought it was hysterical 
__label__1  read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who i ve never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he s the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu writer director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman s isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so it s even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as well none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake outs there is a side story that s thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths this is one of my favorites of the year originally written 7 28 2002 
__label__1 uneven bollywood drama karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend sanjay kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller film is compelling its few song dance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film s drama at least once we ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy go lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance are dispensed with his throw away comic book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film s primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay s sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious ad libs the directorial style of writer director krishna wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti s soundtrack cd but bollywood hasn t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but shakti is karisma kapoor s film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes despite the unevenness of much of the picture karisma s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette both of which i d seen just prior although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family here living in the austerity of terrorism controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china s tang dynasty whose self serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext 
__label__0 i do not believe all the praise for this movie the play and movie were a ripoff of sleuth michael caine wishes he were olivier and reeves wishes he were caine caine even had the nerve to do a remake of sleuth with jude law playing his original part jude law you mean the one that did the remake of alfie this movie was made during a period of caine s career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts he would do anything for money he would star in such award winning movies such as this and beyond the poseidon adventure what seems to be driving the praise for this movie is reeves death he deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie and so does caine this movie can be found in the 5 97 bin at walmart along with gems like the island and blame it on rio 
__label__0 my friends and i rented this for bad movie night with high hopes but the brain was something of a letdown the brain itself is gloriously goofy looking but it mostly just sits on its little platform who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn out minutes this movie has a number of things going for it at first including an estevez knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius we re told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts which include putting krazy glue on someone s chair it also has some great lines a hilariously out of shape and out of breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere and yeah some chick gets naked however the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing during the last half things just start to drag on and on with at least 3 or 4 pointless boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot the scenes inside the pri complex are especially bad at least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell i could ve fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour more cheese more gore more nudity more brain action if you re going to make a bad horror movie at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest 
__label__1 my family goes back to new orleans late 1600 s early 1700 s and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand parents never talked about but we knew it existed i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can pass as white and chose not to it s a hard history to watch when you realize that it s your family they re talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the arse of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence and at the same time had i not come out of that history i probably wouldn t be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor but it is a movie that needed to be made anne rice is incredible and i ask myself why is she symbolically writing about my family and i m not i recommend this movie to everyone leza
__label__1 the fourth in the dirty harry series this film features one of the most despicable ugliest unlikable profane disgusting females i have ever seen on film ray perkins played by audrie neenan she is the modern nasty low life version of the 1945 detour character ann savage her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up and least some of her then i could enjoy the rest of the movie everywhere harry callahan clint eastwood goes violence immediately follows within minutes it happens so often it s almost laughable but it makes for a fast moving entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one by one this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts and connects sad to say most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end and who does it better than dirty harry 
__label__1 i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel spring 2004 what a surprise this german production a stylish and imaginative shocker is one of the scariest flic i have seen be warned this is not a joke this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors as an example peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence excellent direction nice production design a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties flesh ripped clean to the bone and the blood runs red this savage heart stopper will grip you and give you some dark dreams a must see :P
__label__0 stereotyped derivative unoriginal and boring western the two popular stars charlton heston and james coburn both give performances that are far from their best and justifiably so they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue heston is a sheriff who liked the world better as it used to be before and coburn is an outlaw who owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt additionally heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and coburn is mean and tough but not as cold blooded a killer as some of the minor villains apparently the filmmakers couldn t come up with even one original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished 1 2 
__label__1 some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting however i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences tomas beccket who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills looked as if he was cold hearted however after beccket showed his day dream of montana we can clearly see his softness inside it was the cruel war and his partners sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold hearted millar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper billy zane did quite well to show millar s hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through one s heart as what beccket said what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities these two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other sniper isn t a good action movie but a good psychological one 
__label__0 gwyneth paltrow is absolutely great in this movie but the story is unfortunately half baked and david schwimmer s energy is sort of like cold mush when he closes his mouth and gets serious for a moment or two there is a rush of what might have been who thought 25 year old kiddies would be entertaining 
__label__0 the reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist robert james waller also author of bridges of madison county the writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible a failing couple a blocked american writer and a pretty mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamed are swept up by a strong self directed criminal and after a few adventures mostly terrifically violent alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of scott glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of giovanna zacarías as luz and not even the stalwart performance of harvey keitel as the cia specialist assigned to track the killer down a serious waste of time 
__label__0 the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80 s well with some good performances however the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichés that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was very disappointing
__label__0 i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic it was awful in every way how badly did jack lemmon james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie 
__label__1 i have to agree with most of the other posts was it a comedy a drama to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name in new york how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold again a comedy or drama but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning i enjoyed kimberly elise s performance she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously she is a younger actress that is going to be viable 
__label__0 this is by far the worst movie i ve ever seen from the plot though the shots the special effects the acting and did i mentioned the plot every single thing in it sucked ass this is a good example of what over doing means and i ll try to explain i understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you can t really tell what the hell is going on up until the end you sit mesmerized not knowing who s dead and who s alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out you re wrong and the movie ends leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes something like unbreakable or the job if you know what i mean but olga levens the writer of this junk yes olga the writer director producer screenplay author caster production designer art director costume designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to olga levens from levens productions you can t go wrong well this might come as a shocker but this time olga over did this big time jumping from scene to scene from dreams to reality but wait this was all a dream after all or was it the picture fades and i realized none of this ever happened the girl was all alone on the ship actually there was no ship no wait there s the ship again and the guys they re alive thank god no they re calling her to join the cruise but then the ship disappears so maybe they re dead after all or maybe they never were alive to begin with if you understood what i just said you might like this movie otherwise it s a boring piece of work and the only reason i set through this entire crap is to find out how the hell can they finish this movie don t watch this if you value time ever 90 minutes are a waste in this case :)
__label__0 i m watching this on the sci fi channel right now it s so horrible i can t stop watching it i m a videographer and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad they re surrounded by what must have been the director s relatives that s the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope it s because there was absolutely no other option the sequel yes sequel is coming on now i think i ll skip it jason
__label__1 the first thing you meet when you study fascism is ostracism because this philosophy is a fake one there s a need to use scapegoats to assess the thought ettore scola s movie probably his masterpiece focuses on the outcasts the scapegoats of the regime of the historical event hitler and mussolini s alliance we will see almost nothing some military march some garlands some scattered voices our two heroes are not invited for the feast of virility genius is essentially masculine this is the golden rule antonietta a never better sophia loren embroidered on her cushion antonietta whose world amounts to her kitchen whose pride is her offsprings at the beginning of the movie she s a victim of this hypermacho world but she does not realize it she thinks she should be happy gabriel on the contrary is politically aware he knows about the cancer that is destroying inexorably his country but as a gay man he is no longer part of it he s about to be arrested forgetting everything that comes between them they realize what they have in common and they make love this is an act of rebellion particularly for antonietta whose ethic should forbid such a thing becoming an adulteress in a land where politics and religion combine to repress women as ever leads her to some kind of political awareness one of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio expect the unexpected and maybe a doctrine which denies the human being his intimate personality will see that its days are numbered 
__label__0 a failure the movie was just not good it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at i mean sure some parts were amusing but most of it is not lindsey lohan is a great actress and a bad singer and she should be working on better movies the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie that is free the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day these songs are so good especially alyson and amanda s walking on sunshine and caleigh peter s beach boy song fun fun fun 4 out of 10 if i gave it a ten 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie not worth your money but the soundtrack is 
__label__0 les visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there s not a lot he can do to save the film now the duke s slave helper he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer if you liked les visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didn t like les visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies 
__label__0 gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story it s too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistan the movie s aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and it s government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won t work and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad most likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided the movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1 please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster 
__label__1  3 in young john travolta s trilogy of blockbusters he dances to disco rock n roll and country he heads to houston to find work and love gilley s is the hot spot and it is the time of the mechanical bull not to be outdone i rode the bull at a club in nashville i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year 1980 was i wore a black cowboy hat that year just like travolta debra winger was in her prime she looks stunning in her red top there is plenty of charisma bud and sissy seem the ideal couple even if they are trailer trash they split up just because it feels so good getting back together urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack we get to hear lyin eyes by the eagles and lookin for love by johnny lee 
__label__1 i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty blood rites as blood rites was entirely awful i really wasn t expecting much from this film but actually it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course there is an inheritance at stake the film is shot in black and white and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic the curious dr humpp there s barely any gore on display and the director seems keener to focus on sex with themes of incest and hatred seeping through the acting is typically trashy but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful the plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler but the music is catchy and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves as most are somewhat erotic overall this is not a great film but it s likely to appeal to the cult fan and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality blood rites 
__label__1 imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources i ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as 68 doesn t really matter except that it s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year pure abstraction isn t really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known 
__label__0 i m amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe i m not part of the same universe because if veronica mars is anything it s over the top in a big way the acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through that s not what i call real it is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cut off from reality rob thomas and his staff are overall i found it to be at best a snooze fest and at worst more than a little annoying kristen bell looks like she could be a good actress but it s hard to tell with the over the top style of the whole show 
__label__1 this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay spiderman improves in both departments it also features the voice of stan lee the creator of spiderman comics as you d expect spiderman does whatever a spider can he does more than spin webs in fact he uses them as weapons and shields when he s not using web in combat he punches and kicks as well spidey has his hands full as he battles venom rhino mysterio scorpion and dr octopus to name a few look for captain america in a cameo most of the levels are challenging but some of them require patience to beat the only complaint about this game is that it s so short and can be completed in less than three hours if you re a real marvel superhero fan this game is for you but don t expect long gameplay better luck in spiderman 2 my evaluation 9 out of 10 
__label__1 i was very surprised with this film i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference so if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than dr dolittle in my opinion paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well 
__label__1 tight script good direction excellent performances strong cast effective use of locations paul mcgann gives a detailed subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously there is an interesting moral emotional journey happening with his character ben turner and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton inevitably they cross over who has done what the examination of why both in the past and in the present rather than who might have yielded a more interesting dostoyevskian story but hey who s complaining 
__label__0 this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actually paid 3 50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that don t seem to have any relevance to the overall film like when heath ledger s priest partner get s nailed to a wall by a ghost what was the point in that scene answers on a postcard please i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it s entire running time i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again this should be cast into imdb s bottom 100 hopefully my vote of 1 10 will help it on it s way 
__label__1 the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler s grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the allied bias turning out to be historical fact the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds the disparity between hitler s military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag declaring peace in our time to this day has durable propaganda qualities here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options freedom or slavery in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively 
__label__1 last night i finished re watching jane eyre 1983 the bbc mini series adapted from charlotte bronte s gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton my favorite james bond as mr edward rochester and zelah clarke as jane eyre a poor orphaned 18 year old girl a governess at mr rochester s estate thornfield jane eyre has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11 years old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words this book is amazing and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it its beautiful language refined fragrant and surprisingly fresh the dialogs and above all two main characters and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers jane eyre has been adapted to tv and big screen many times 18 according to imdb the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg george c scott and susannah york ciarán hinds and samantha morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society laws religion by the differences in age backgrounds experiences and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years of all these films i ve only seen one 300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class he was mr rochester sardonic vibrant the force of nature powerful passionate sexy and tormented master of thornfield zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet gentle intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning and quiet but firm willpower added on september 17 2007 during the last two weeks i ve seen five jane eyre movies and it was a wonderful experience there is something to admire in every adaptation of jane eyre even if not all of them are completely successful this version is still my favorite jane eyre film 
__label__0 i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf 1994 with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke 
__label__0 it s rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product was i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film makers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other palestinians in prison i understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber s parents and her angry and closed minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control it is more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it is a poor documentary and a poor film i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart wrenching and sad subject matter 
__label__0 really really bad slasher movie a psychotic person escapes from an asylum three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene one semester yesterday later hey that s what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor the students are all bored as are we there are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves how long has that body been there and also at least one of the dead people don t seem to have been missed by others the killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead is his knife poisoned or something the video box cover has a cheerleader there aren t any in the movie the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room the central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene the killer is strictly one on one 
__label__0 i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn accordingly i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it i should have known better this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the don t sing a longs to the characterization while i remember the character s telling a story through a song this film s soundtrack was laid over the top and didn t seem to fit jaq s transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall and in the ballroom there s old barn dance type country music it s as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat fiddles certainly didn t fit even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isn t up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of cinderella s hoop skirt which doesn t feel right the movie itself could have been it s own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldn t say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original 
__label__0 i like british humor i believe it s one of the best in the world i like almost every british sitcom okay maybe not monthy python some of the jokes were great but some of them i didn t understand but this league of gentlemen is just something good to make you sick this show was good in some way it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel i m not hungry anymore this is really just disgusting sick and not even funny tv show and i wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff i watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off it was so disgusting watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car i mean what s so funny about that it makes me wanna puke no humor just disturbing images and cheap toilet laughs i don t know if you like this stuff you go ahead watch it but to be honest people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems garbage 
__label__1 holes is a wonderful film to see it has good messages in in such as be a good friend never give up etc i highly recommend it to anyone i still say the book is better than the movie but the movie gives the book a run for its money also khleo thomas plays zero that really adds to it lol 
__label__0 awwww yes it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by abc sears and has their home renovated that s where the humanistic appeal ends i liked it early in its run but now this show has become disgustingly excessive ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on the people at habitat for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief for example is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or have his bed tricked out with low rider hydraulics does the mom really need her dilapidated non running and rusted out old pick up truck restored and pimped by some of the best customizers in california a new one would have done the job quite nicely and probably for a third of the price do people really need a sixty five inch plasma screen in every room of the house and then there s the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills even after the zaniacs at makeover leave somebody still has earn a living i doubt the friendly folks down at social services will see the humor in all of this largess this show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for abc and a tacit commercial for its sponsors 
__label__0 terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally it s the woman below the sea her room mate lainie kazan soon winds up dead on the floor an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene that s how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him by the film s end you don t know why the girl was murdered don t even bother to ask 
__label__1 fassbinder s most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations here it s much more overt since the story takes place in war torn germany at the end of wwii and the central character is a woman hanna schygulla as maria who capitalizes on vulnerabilities both economic and gender related to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers as she once was married amidst allied air raids maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he s shipped out to the russian front in his absence her despair is great she spends most days at the train station waiting for him to return when he is reported dead she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi s when he returns things get plenty messy as circumstances and his sense of noble self sacrifice conspire to keep them apart the message is fassbinder s m o writ large love is colder than death but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post war germany selling out to the highest bidder but as with all his films i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display fassbinder s as evoked through his characters his actors as filtered through their real life connections with fassbinder taken together his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric often at once this falls somewhere in between although definitely closer to the latter while i didn t like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what s more i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions 
__label__1 well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked marie forsa as the busty helga is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn t one wishes they made more movies like this one 
__label__0 this was a weird movie it started out pretty good a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing next comes his down fall here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy b movie poor acting i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop these guys could not after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts from this point on it is bad acting big boobs the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake off i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse 
__label__0 yeti curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas unlucky really with some dead some alive the survivors have to think about themselves decide to wait it out until help comes however just when they think their luck couldn t get any worse they soon discover that a huge hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill eat them all trapped cold starving fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time yeah with a title like yeti curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing that is that someone at the sci fi channel has made yet another creature feature although to give these things a bit of variety the sci fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a beast feast as if that will make any difference directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time sure it s bad but it s sort of fun at times too the basic premise is alright actually it s a sort of cross between alive 1993 with it s plane crash the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive the excellent gory killer bigfoot another legendary hairy monster exploitation flick night of the demon 1980 which i would defend with my last breath i have to say it s not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it s fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written the character s are mostly annoying american teens there s the expected arguing there s the macho hero the strong female the coward who thinks only of himself so there s no prizes for originality there are some plot holes too if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them how are you going to dig a large hole line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her the there are actually two yeti s running around twist isn t used to any effect at all either at least there s a good pace about the film it certainly moves along at a fair old pace i never found myself becoming bored with it there s some moderately gory action the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not if they are going to eat their dead mates or not the one thing you can always say about these sci fi channel creature features or beast feasts is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious so that proves to be the case yet again the plane crash at the start looks awful the yeti when it s cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it s on a pogo stick there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm a squashed head a ripped out heart some dead bodies some blood splatter the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half beats him with his own ripped off legs before biting a big chunk out of them according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three a half hours to get into the suit the make up which seems like a long time since it s actually a pretty tatty looking creation apparently the original title was raksha curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit so now you know this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh bleak himalayas was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm the acting isn t that good i didn t think any of the girls looked that good either which didn t help yeti curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc fi channel creature feature if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn t too bad there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it s not very good 
__label__1 every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter around this was that movie for me i can tell you the whole plot exactly i must have seen it 100 times at least and i can say it is a good kids family movie i still have the tape i haven t watched it in 5 years but maybe i ll get around to it this week and be a kid for the day you just have to love the care bears and their messege 
__label__0 much has been written about purple rain the apparent quin essential musician bio movie however i m here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it s high praise first of all let s get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels even the score is mesmerising and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it s not and as such the movie has some problems first of all is the horrendous acting writing prince s character the kid is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments unfortunately prince s character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it s hard to believe that he d get the girl this way everything just seems a little off here which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that s terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live but we aren t ever allowed to get inside of it a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert prince and morris s lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here which i guess makes sense from a business perspective but it s exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage especially when the character s back stories get pushed aside for it so to sum it up this isn t a very good movie 
__label__0 so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it s hard to know where to begin first of all it s a remarkably un scary scary movie even by amercian standards the dialogue is cliché the characters are two dimensional the writing is ho hum and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting we meet the following stereotypes in order balding loser guy probably divorced but who knows this movie doesn t tell us with a brave heart the young hero who doesn t do anything heroic at all brave little kid with a homicidal streak a mile wide and black bad ass bitch with more brawn than brains these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary reaper man and his evil ewoks oh and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people given a chance they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen t have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them booh actually one of them is haunted by a good ghost but then again it might be a deceitful spectre who seems intent on helping our brave contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend there is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters it starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie but this doesn t explain a lot if you ve seen the first two movies fine otherwise you don t know who these people are how they are related why they aren t in school or at work or why you should care whether they live or die consequently you don t the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects and there aren t enough of those to keep you awake of potenial interest amusement are the three raider punks as stupid as they are evil who menace our heroes but they don t get much screen time they are offed almost immediately then they are buried why anybody should take the time is beyond me then they appear again as evil raider punk zombies only to be offed again literally within a minute the rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of caspar the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing driving around looking for places and balding loser trying to score som bad black bitch booty using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager no dice there not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie so good thing there never is any the head baddie called the tall man doesn t manage to scare anyone older than 3 years howling booooy every five minutes isn t enough why he with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper body strength doesn t simply squash our heroes like bugs isn t explained instead he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell filmgoers who like masterpieces like friday 13th part xxxxviii jason goes to college might find some entertainment the rest of us who have developed pubic hair will be bored out of our skulls 
__label__0 does this film suck horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible nothing redeeming here for even the most die hard of horror fans a crazy killer stalks students at a college people are showing up dead in the hallways but still class carries on as normal after about the 4th body i would think that they could allow the students a few days break lol this about as bad as it gets folks this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals you have been warned 
__label__1 nothing new is this tired serio comedy that wastes the talents of danny glover and whoopi goldberg considering that this was produced by the stars and spike lee it s pretty tame and tired stuff and how come the whoop never changes her hair or glasses over the many years this film covers blah 
__label__1 i bought this a year or more ago for 2 yep 2 left it on the shelf for ages now watching dvds while holed up with a cold this is a haunting movie brilliant performances by all involved especially the 6yo boy about the only smiles you get in this movie plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever grosse pointe blank but obviously that s lighthearted this is heavy hearted as a psychologist a clinical and forensic psychologist a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed scary stuff brilliant work all round pete
__label__1 a toothsome little potboiler whose 65 minute length doesn t seem a second too short my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem hitchcock s the lady vanishes is one example out of work julia ross nina foch finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend after reporting to duty she wakes up having been drugged in a vast manderley like pile on the cornish coast supposedly as the barmy in the crumpet wife of george macready who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks his doting enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good vs evil than she occupied in the lady vanishes the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically we know what s going on but are powerless to tell poor julia this movie curiously is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few british films noirs i think it s closer to the gothic old dark house tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption it does however evince a more modern psychoanalytic cast of mind whatever you call it it remains a sharply satisfying thriller 
__label__1 working class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro both terrific she s a widow who can t move on he s illiterate and a closet inventor you can probably guess the rest adaptation of pat barker s novel union street a better title is so laid back it verges on bland and the film s editing is a mess but it s still pleasant a rosy hued blue collar fantasy there are no overtures to serious issues even the illiteracy angle is just a plot tool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree the finale is pure fluff and cynics will find it difficult to swallow though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn t really be satisfying any other way from 
__label__0 like freddy s revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn t go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy i ve not alot to say about this it s moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series 
__label__1 besides planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck this is john candy s funniest movie when he gets hypnotized with the playing card similar to the manchurian candidate and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying he makes two very memorable quotes both deal with the male anatomy the love scene involving grocery items has to be seen it cannot be described 
__label__1 as a kid i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent this movie as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost hypnotic music shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer this is a whole package deal between the music and the video that really packs a one two punch if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation this is a must have i still almost 20 years later rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites the originality i think is still unsurpassed by most of today s mcmovies that hollywood spits out i am currently wanting to see if i can re make it on my own if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a ton of imitation =)
__label__1 its too bad a lot of people didn t understand this and the next episode but don t worry ill explain it too you this episode is split in 2 parts first part is tony s dream in his coma second part is what happens in real life now what people didn t understand is that tony s dream is more then just a dream in this episode its about his preparation for his death he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world you will notice what i m saying at the doctor scene where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains his life they makers really did a superb job of interpreting they re own thoughts of what happens when you die if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing with great spiritual meanings like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb only thing i didn t understand was what the role where of the monks gonna re watch it till i get this anyways this episode really touched me and i don t think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience 10 10 no doubt :)
__label__1 i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and don t just drip feed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesn t compare to other mind mucks like the usual suspects or memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thought provoking film another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it you ll know what i mean so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well no one ever said revolver is for everyone and that s my 2 cents 
__label__0 crude some times crass to me that s the summation of madhur bhandarkar s latest work page 3 he has no point of view just shallow funny digs at stereotypes what is the movie about is it about reporting a clan of people so called page 3 types who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life that they have no time for anything else and you are either in it or out of it is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents madhur bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and page 3 is just a supplement perhaps an entertainer for checking out who s who and what s what don t mix the two and then there is power play that would happen in every walk of life so what have you told at the end of it all nothing just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie 
__label__0 i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie the only thing i did see was quentin tarantino s seeming insane obsession for it there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality overall however i found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and dizzying even sickening overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the u s military against various malcontents the various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and conclusions a depressing movie not a true _film_ a term i reserve for true art that left me with a bad feeling do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a romantic comedy though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content form and conclusion any association with this genre i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources 
__label__0 having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling i simply couldn t believe it the movie is really awful in fact it is so awful that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced during this i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so called comedies from the 60 s and 70 s the pattern is as follows take one extremely popular comedian make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible add a bunch of jokes especially one liners and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls film that and you have a success i wouldn t know if this movie was a success but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly with a few great comedians it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us 
__label__0 lol not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was 15 i saw this film when i was 9 the film s funky disco music will get stuck in your head not to mention the film s theme song by the yetians this is the worst creature effects i ve ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b movies memorable quotes take a tranquilizer and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man 1977 which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language thematic elements and some scary scenes 
__label__1 i look at this page and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic sure i agree to let everyone have their opinion but here s mine this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher and should be seen many casual viewers around the world sure it has lost some of it s flair and greatness with age especially in todays world of cgi effects but that s not why you should like it you should like it because it actually is a scary movie even for today s standards it s overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences so don t slam a classic if you haven t given it a chance watch it but not with a critical attitude watch it to have fun how it was originally intended 
__label__1 hello this movie is well okay just kidding its awesome it s not a block buster smash hit it s not meant to be but its a big hit in my world and my sisters we are rockin rollers go ramones this is a great movie for me 
__label__1 this is one of may all time favourite films parker posey s character is over the top entertaining and the librarian motif won t be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks world if you re a library student rent this then buy the poster and hang it on your wall the soundtrack is highly recommendable too i ve shown this film to more library friends than any other they all fall in love with it 
__label__0 i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smith s first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasn t but i gave it a go what a dead end film being true to life hardly serves you if you re merely going to examine tediousness esp tediousness that we re already familar with i m sorry but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum wage jobs in the service sector i knew that before i saw the film it didn t really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real handheld camera no music etc what s going on hardly plays out as it would in the real world would an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after abandoning his job and screwing up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on him a big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because he s stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one he s a dope he doesn t pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero personalty if i had to hire someone he wouldn t make it past the interview i m looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the this is an important film stuff american job doesn t work 
__label__1 i saw this movie in 1959 when i was 11 years old at a drive in theater with my family way back then i thought it was very funny even though i was too young to understand 90 of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight i saw it again this morning on turner south as i watched it i was absolutely convulsed with laughter the mating game is a unique classic from a by gone age if you re too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film i feel very sorry for you there s no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can even today deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to old timers like me having said that all i can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like the mating game movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people and as such these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand in other words if you don t understand the issues the film is addressing please don t embarrass yourself by offering comments which frankly make no sense 
__label__1 clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this but this one does not embarrass him dirty harry catches everyone s attention and unless one wants to watch romance there is no reason why you won t like him he is cool because he is dirty is great because he kills without much thinking is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn t care from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts the character of the lead role always captivates the audience in white hunter black heart he is the crazy director in in the line of fire he is the old un while here is the almost jobless with his job that is to say he makes work for himself doesn t care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation based on a rape victim this movie is promising for all the no non sense movie watchers the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot however what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not as it is far too obvious from the beginning it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving also there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry 
__label__1 it s a difficult movie to classify 10 items or less generally i don t care about defining genres but there s something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category in order to transmit even with only one word your feelings about it i completely recommend this film to anyone and if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life you ll want to do the same as soon as you ve finished watching it i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it s not perfect but it doesn t do anything wrong i don t want to sound like i contradict myself but i believe writer director brad silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script i m sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection a product that would be as simple appealing and uncompromising as its title well he s done it silberling director of long complex dramatic movies like city of angels and moonlight mile proves with 10 items or less which closes in at just 70 minutes the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it to put an actor morgan freeman in front of a woman paz vega in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what silberling proposes here i can t tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn t be underestimated because here everyone s exposed the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that s not endless only because life is life and let me express how praise how well silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time not only in movie duration time but in the single day that the movie develops its events and in a smaller place the kind of connection between two characters that sofia coppola generated in lost in translation that movie set in tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives it s in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of 10 items or less and just as in coppola s movie the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don t seem forced or included in the picture to buy time in this aspect the collaboration of silberling and his director of photography phedon papamichael the man who shot the beautiful sceneries in sideways and focused on every emotion in patch adams delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty but the ultimate beauty of 10 items or less can be found in its cast by avy kaufman in its two protagonists they are the ones who transmit this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i can t specify we feel their connection and we can tell they re having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff academy award winner morgan freeman also an executive producer of the film simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry and one that s well deserved a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh and the beautiful paz vega well i said she was great in spanglish here she proves she s the real deal and hollywood s not small for her 
__label__0 first up this film according to the slick said it won best film at worldfest film festival in houston texas hmmm must have been a quiet year wouldn t call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b grader body melt but at least that film didn t look like it was shot on hi 8 video my guess is the film makers watched a lot of troma films and really bad b grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film don t get me wrong i love really low grade films just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy bad taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste if you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no budget film making watch it otherwise stay away 
__label__0 okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought the beginning started off fine for me it seemed to be heading in a decent direction got past the rape scene and i couldn t figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie don t get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn t really bother me to a dramatic point then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn t have that it had about 3 of these pointless scenes where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn t show it right making me want to fast forward then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn t so boring but still a little dull oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya s attention thats where it got disturbing i didn t feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so i don t know i cant find a word to sum it up but if you choose to watch it just don t be unsuprised 
__label__1 i really enjoyed this movie britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you holly fulfills her dreams just like britney there are times in everyones lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens i would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams she will never know how much that means to me bravo britney you are the greatest 
__label__1 this is a delightful movie that is so over the top that my wife daughter and i found it irresistible the plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities i particularly enjoyed kevin kline s and sally field s performances i don t anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded field s character s truly desperate need for attention and affirmation and her almost bipolar swings in mood played nicely against the background of field s famous infamous you like me oscar exclamation people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world i think this is the only movie where i didn t find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization i thought she was spot on in every note she struck robert downey jr teri hatcher cathy moriarty and elizabeth shue were also first rate as well just a great movie if you re in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh 
__label__1 it is not every film s job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a mass market hit any day while this really can t be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the long delayed climax of leo s awakening comes about 20 minutes late great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging a character is rear projected but his own hand in the foreground isn t the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop the compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan scan format must have never seen it where is the dvd it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock s foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary over rated un nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark 
__label__0 awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren t any negative scores in the imdb com rating system zaphoidps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it s called an indirect proportionality quality 1 star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less z
__label__0 i m a huge fan of ivan reitman i loved evolution and who didn t like ghostbusters from the trailer you already know that uma s character will get dumped by luke s so the build up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him but the pay off is just not there the shark tossing did manage to get a slight giggle but once again it was all in the trailer no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is diet owen on his good days if not for riann wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp this is a comedy right it s not awful it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge this could have been such a brilliant send up of superhero movies and feminism but fails on both counts let s see if jason reitman can salvage the family name 
__label__0 rachel jo hannah tina bradley and john are all on top form here they deserve oscar nominations for their performances i am a great fan of the tv show aswell their music rocks and they re all so talented i am also a great exponent of sarcasm if you re an s club fan do not read this the performances are terribly weak the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed properly i feel sorry for the director the jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little passionate s club fans weren t laughing they thought they could do it better and they did they conquered the world they became s club juniors paul the fat ugly one who started a mosh band must be thanking his lucky stars that he left when he did one of the worst movies ever made beware of this movie do not go and see it you won t laugh you will cry 0 10 rjt
__label__0 if you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium unfortunately the butcher brothers haven t grasped this yet this film sucks unlike the majority of its characters who if you didn t work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you preference stringing up the plentiful supply of no one knows where i am cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger past their isolated door the only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy forced to up sticks as opposed stakes on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses they really are none too bright if they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother i am not sure it added zero to the plot which was unfortunate given that there wasn t a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all one was never told why the parents had died unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again it was for the viewer to write their own reason the only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like pugsley from the adams family indeed he was way too rounded having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a weight watchers class in to a very bad horror film oh heavens he had never mind dear have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre 
__label__1 wow this movie was absolutely brilliant i really don t know why everyone says it has a slow pace i thought the pace was perfect the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit man killer working for john rooney paul newman he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially he had nothing and mr rooney gave him everything but his children are unaware that this is his job and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him he is placed in an awkward position and when an atrocity occurs he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge they rob abanks and much more and build a bond they re the perfect team hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were 
__label__0 this movie does have some great noirish neorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywood s sugar coating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film but some of the scenes go on for much too long the wedding especially and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen the dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on most of the characters were either italian americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks toward the end i was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk but it absolutely did not work for me another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason the main character s son born and raised in new york in the 1920 s suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent i m only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in england i give this movie an a for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution 
__label__0 a cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland the romance is very unrealistic fluttery lovey dovey perfect etc the cinderella plot till the very end and shahid kapoor is the only reason for my stars if you re looking for a dreamy romance with a twist this is definitely you re movie but for the rest of us real world people i d highly recommend saving your three hour watch time wake up people four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film we had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes maybe i m missing something i just can t believe a movie like this can beat a classic like hddcs 
__label__0  aka trinity is still my name this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box office success of they call me trinity only this time joseph e levine and avco embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well too bad they didn t get very far since the hill spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the u s and this largely boring drawn out film doesn t help it out any trinity and bambino swear to their dying father harry carey jr that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other they later get involved with arms traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery and who mistakenly think they re a pair of federal agents it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and don t know how to carry themselves and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsboro like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good not sure if i d want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn t have dragged on for so long it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here in fact i lost interest in it about 2 3rds of the way through the dvd is also terrible with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky a big step down from the previous film 4 out of 10
__label__0 i m a huge randolph scott fan but this film is a dud the whole thing has a canned fake soundstage feel to it with truly awful rear screen projection it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters the directing is pedestrian and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it i ve seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage productions before but this is not one of them all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott boetticher films all the more randolph scott is tanned trim and shines that million dollar smile throughout he s always a pleasure even in the worst of his films aside from scott the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms wymore in errol flynn s movie rocky mountian in man behind the gun she is just as beautiful and you can tell she s a good actress but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful i ve only seen phil carey in operation pacific and he plays the exact same character here an arrogant pain in the butt you want to beat into unconsciousness i guess it proves he s a good actor he made me hate him there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film in my opinion although there are many elements to knock i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbers but that s not why we go to see randolph scott movies right there are definitely worse scott films out there and this one certainly isn t unbearable but it also certainly couldn t be deemed anything beyond mediocre 
__label__0 that shall be a documentary i saw it which is forbidden in germany and i have to say that it was the worst documentary i ve ever seen it is nothing but one big lie from the beginning to the end who can doubt after this trash that all jews were supposed to be killed in the concentration camps 
__label__1 i like films that don t provide the typical happy ending and that s my main reason for my liking of this movie alice marano danes and her best friend darlene beckinsale are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether or which of the girls was involved and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind magnanimous wife yon who is also an attorney i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison as another commenter has suggested as i ve heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal where this film grabs me however is its ending alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned and we the viewers realize that they are both innocent any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me and this well acted drama is certainly deserving 
__label__0 the movie was a huge disappointment especially since it was directed by priyadarshan it was sad to see such dismal standards poor screenplay almost non existent and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer some of the scenes were funny but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration the editing was pathetic dismal overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval one wouldn t miss anything at all if you don t watch the movie not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie wait till it appears on tv 
__label__1 this film is an excellent military movie it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but as a retired soldier i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted the story itself has been told and retold several times over but it remains for a professional soldier and an african american at that to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the us navy to the world the story of brashear s work to become a navy diver and his life as a navy diver beyond his graduation is not the only story that is presented there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday defied the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one stripe and a change of assignment it also told the true story how brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950 s and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself this was a complex story that was worth telling and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible as a professional soldier i was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner 
__label__1 the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair then our hero who is called tenshu is taken to the chair he s zapped and then he s still alive aha he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool either we zap you until we ve made sure you re actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story commences he wakes up in a different sort of cell very high tech and very big where he finds another cell mate who also managed to survive the electric boogie ride a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish as long as it happens within that room sounds a little suspicious but the two men accept what else can they do what these two men do not know is that they have been set together so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them basically the unknown scientists in the background p s them off until they decide that they should kill each other sounds weird indeed but there s a greater purpose to all of this this is the part which should not be revealed and so it shall remain unrevealed but fear not it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo action movie fore it has an entirely different approach to the question how long time can you stand being with a man who s an s o b and would you kill him to obtain freedom the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest it sneaks up without you actually knowing it then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix like action fight scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon the movie is indeed very special so special that normal cinemas won t view it under normal circumstances however the story is fascinating the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit some more than others to make the movie truly unique if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash 
__label__1 when i think women in prison my mind often goes to sleazy italian spanish productions by directors such as jess franco and bruno mattei and while these films are often very sleazy they re also very samey and once you ve seen one you might as well have seen them all i have to admit that these types of films generally aren t my favourites but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of italy and spain and roger corman s new world pictures is responsible for some of the best of them caged heat is the directorial debut of oscar winning director jonathan demme and it s a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value naturally the film centres on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a women s prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates this prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound superintendent mcqueen and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls leading them to plot an escape this film is much lighter on the sleaze than i m used to in a women in prison flick but this is more than compensated for by some great action scenes and dialogue and that s what ensures caged heat entertains throughout it does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it but that s not such a big problem the film never gets boring and is peppered with standout scenes including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery the film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece the silence of the lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts including best of all the legendary barbara steele in the role of the head prison warden overall caged heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end but it s a brilliantly entertaining little grindhouse flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down 
__label__1 if i didn t know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasn t it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing the unfortunate events of september 11 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 11 
__label__0 this movie had a good story but was brought down because it didn t have enough horror film elements and violence it was like watching a live action cartoon it would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going 
__label__0 this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it i m sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i don t know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you don t do so worst movie i ve seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
__label__1 bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in italy but that seems more metaphor than reality well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor the revolutionaries of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be mafiosi out with the old and in with the new andrea s papa a psychoanalyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values morally upright unperturbed clean and tidy thoroughly ritualized giullia the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands i m guessing here andrea the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way upatz he s respectful of his father but disobedient too he loves giullia or so we assume although he s not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as media he s the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from antigone which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will that brings us by no particular course that i m aware of to marushka detmars she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago two hippos are neck deep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank and one hippo says to the other i hate her she s a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film she carries with her in her speech and manner the rich glitter of outright lunacy and it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid detmars isn t nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in repulsion the walls don t turn to rubber and grow hands instead we see her animated sometimes too animated and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening a critic described her as sultry but that s probably not the word he was searching for she s compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair her wide white ready grin her impulsive giggles and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs the sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because we ve gotten to know the characters involved it s more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick actually there isn t that much sex there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time at least real time for an eighteen year old boy the young man who plays andrea is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia they have to carry it and they do if it were not for their performances i m not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance worth it 
__label__1 first off consider that this film is nearly fifty years old yet it still stands up as one of the great films of all time i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050 the story is simple yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day i can still recall the first time i watched this as a kid when the monster enters the force field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first and only time had me shivering in fear i can tell you looks dated today but still more than effective enough the scenes with the tiger show their age now you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira but they are only just visible likewise the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done it s also amazing to see leslie nielsen better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies as a young but still mature man he was 30 when this film came out nearly 80 now all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come timeless 
__label__1 most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm not so this gloriously bent batty and berserk over the top italian made shot in canada kitsch gut buster it s a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over baked what the hell s going on crackpot excess and inanity a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30 foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70 s disco stud complete with jumbo wavy afro perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice they dethaw the beast jolt him back to life with electric charges grossly mistreat him and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth before you can say hey the filmmakers are obviously ripping off king kong our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen the gorgeous pheonix grant he lays lustful eyes on and storms away with his new lady love the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience of course he breaks free again nabs the vixen and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage the sublimely stupid dialogue sample line philosophy has no place in science professor cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw dropping awfulness clunky mis direction and a heavy handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere is the yeti a man or a beast ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen better still we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti s nipples which causes it to harden and elicits a big leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth the vixen nurses the yeti s wounded hand while he makes goo goo eyes at her the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building and the furry fellow even breaks a man s neck with his toes overall this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that s eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following 
__label__0 can a pix ever ever ever do anything right this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format since a pix doesn t even believe in pan and scan we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side of course not that you are missing much this movie is incredibly bad it s very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80 of the movie for no reason 
__label__1 we have high expectations with this one because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci however its co directed by bruno mattei from night of the zombies and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso night of the zombies and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies hell of the living dead a lot as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2 fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic zombi 3 is not magical its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut butter but over the years i ve grown to accept zombi 3 i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room there was a senseless fulci cut and the mattei fulci cut is the one on dvd 
__label__0 i saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when i was a sophomore in high school i took a date to see it i didn t get any needless to say because the film was so bad joan rivers career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap in fact unfunny isn t a severe enough term this film is anti funny you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen this isn t worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being so bad it s good not even the gang at mst3k could ve made this worth watching the fact that billy crystal s career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle 
__label__1  the mother tells of a recently widowed mid 60 s mother of two adult children reid who on the heels of her husband s death finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter s married lover the film dwells on the quietly passive mom her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover and the convolutions arising therefrom a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents the mother does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism will play best with more mature audiences possibly women who may better empathize with the central character her needs and issues b 
__label__0 this was a disappointing movie considering the material army life is always good for a laugh and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin williams lead and someday win an oscar 
__label__0 i read the reviews before i watched this movie and i didn t believe them i love crap movies and i expected this one to be average it wasn t this film makes camp blood 1 and 2 look like greats the film contains bad acting poor sound poor confusing storyline bad makeup and it bored me so much i turned it off even the nudity was rubbish did they even have a budget for this film i don t think they did you can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood avoid this trash i watched it on tv and felt riped off so don t spend anything on it the best part is probably the end 
__label__1 first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also shows his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be well crafted the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking stereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall 
__label__1 first saw this movie in about 1990 and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we d quote from it at the drop of a hat i m going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there 15 years later it s become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay i ve found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek and this movie provides it all pathos suspense unrequited love nobility and the list goes on royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller i remember seeing him in the 7 faces of dr lao as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning if you aren t careful you ll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments little subtle costume digs at other sci fi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e coyote don t spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking and shouldn t be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they won t know they re being mocked now if you ll excuse me i m gonna go get a zag nut bar ramsay rc cowlishaw karaoke dj entertainer
__label__1 cult classics are nearly impossible to predict who could guess that vision quest fight club and 2001 a space oddysey movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release would become immensely popular like many imdbers i consider myself a movie expert unlike the majority of those who hated envy evidenced by a dismal 4 4 rating i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade the plot of the movie is ridiculous the dialogue isn t clever the scenes have little continuity and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader but that s exactly why the movie is so hilarious you see in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically detached point of view why do i love envy because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good this is the recipe for a cult classic and envy definitely fits the bill 
__label__0  shut it off the prologue with fu manchu s birthday and the opening credits of the assassins training is amusing then it drops off faster than hair sprayed with neat look for a cameo by cato in the beginning with a figurative wink at the audience 
__label__0 i am a very big fan of jenna jameson but this movie is horrible at the time jenna jameson was married to brad armstrong and he was the director of this film and jenna was the hottest porn star ever so of course brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film now i know why they don t make big budget porn movies anymore in a fantasy world porn stars could act but this is the real world and they can t act that s why there porn stars if a women as beautiful as jenna could act then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn just because your beautiful doesn t make you a movie star a fine example of this is traci lords when she was a teen thru her 20 s she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth she made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn t act where is she now i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because jenna is so hot but there are better movies she has made then dream quest come on jenna we don t want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you have sex also you jenna would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film 
__label__0 well ok i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say i actually think this movie is good this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie isn t that bad i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick this movie is not half bad it has some scares and some really hot women i might add plus it shows off joey lawrence s new beefy look though obviously even that hasn t won him any big hollywood roles either i feel bad for the man he had such a career in the early and mid 90 s with blossom some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene but then like in a 360 degree turn his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one the movie also throws you off guard in it makes you think between the crew there really is a secret that someone knows to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret it also throws you off on who the killer is i had an idea but still woulnd t think the killer was who he was but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown now had there been a secret that was let out this movie could ve been one of the better b rated movies but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie a so so slasher flick good for a midnight movie 
__label__0 there are bad movies terrible movies even boring movies i can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its tackier than a novelty mug my missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button the girls well they were not great to start with denise done ok in starship troopers and wild things but you have sank to the gravel i feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this pamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen 
__label__0 i noticed fire was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn t recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in 85 twenty years later the film is still awful besides the synthesizer the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s as is evident in the title song hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them and to compound this musical assault rob lowe s character played saxophone and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo all the characters were intensely unappealing although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them actually i thought mare winningham was appealing and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob lowe s character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon 
__label__0 fashionably fragmented yet infuriatingly half realized character study an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a pot smoking womanizing rabble rouser we never learn why these young men are friends they may share confusions about the world and their places in it but they don t seem to have anything else in common making his directorial debut jack nicholson who also co wrote the screenplay with jeremy larner based upon larner s book doesn t introduce us to the characters with any clarity nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen there are some very decent performances here particularly from newcomer william tepper in the central role but most of the picture is unformed perhaps intentionally sketchy or unsure bruce dern plays the hard driving basketball coach karen black is the older married lady tepper is having an affair with and michael margotta is tepper s wayward friend in an off putting over the top performance nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor preferring i assume to let the character interaction dominate the film s tone his script is no help either and as a result it is unclear whom we re supposed to sympathize with small random moments do work a supermarket fight between tepper and black dern visiting tepper in his dorm room all of the scenes set on the court however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess hoping to juxtapose an all important b ball game with a sexual assault nicholson shows no style at his craft nor does he earn points for chutzpah as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly when a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors one has to question his motives in doing so perhaps if drive he said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste unfortunately the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie 1 2 from

__label__0 i find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can t muster the film making prowess to pull it off the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesn t take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror the surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon a scruffy and half mad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father s paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirrel eating albino part of the movie s charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didn t really expect it to come out this way but it s good enough wrap scene blur hopelessly take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug addled feverish stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father s voice as she reads his diary while we re still talking about a living dead picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious dark stranger who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater i generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it s not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks the general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyuck s general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and i d file messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it s not particularly gory trashy or sleazy 
__label__0 i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom 1 2 and saif ali khan s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback after watching it i understood that why their wasn t a proper trailer because there wasn t anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story line there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it s difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft unrealistic e g 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns while i was watching tashan it reminded me of 3 films sin city during the opening credits koyla anil kapoor s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny i also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as dhoom 2 and i don t know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times better the only 2 good songs are dil haara challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film even anil kapoor s terrible english couldn t save this discomfiture

__label__1 just after i saw the movie the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the real magic in a movie the combination of the right music speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body very special things i saw where the not knowing effects in the movie started with the disney logo transforming into the cinderella castle and ended as an old story telling fairytale with your grandparents the magic has returned in me i rate this movie 8 out of 10 
__label__0 let me be clear i ve used imdb for years but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating i ve seen hundreds of films some of them bad a few awful never though have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence of high intentions and failure mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess but entirely unbelievable as phocion a young boy fiona shaw is always an entertaining character but the dialogue in the film is much worse even than in the insipid french play that is the source marivaux never reached hollywood until now and we should keep it that way to illustrate for example that leontine is a brilliant passionate philosopher and scientist she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker shouting out names of famous scientists and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier for this the pair should receive a joint clair danes award which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990 s see miss danes in les miserables aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming for example there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action sitting in chairs watching the principal characters the director wants us to realize she s adapted a play i get it but it doesn t happen at all until far into the film at that point seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment then disappearing is creepy and distracting they re like some sort of un scary zombie crowd appearing through the mists filling us with dread when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie you ll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes matthew mcguire
__label__1 joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated he s been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of strong solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor and that s what s so great about him he really seems to mean what he s saying regardless of how cliché obvious or silly which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones oliver reed and don stroud it s what made the walking tall trilogy work so well and that same magic is here in final justice this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era by moving the action from texas to europe there s a real timeless quality that doesn t jar you away from the action on screen to be honest i ve always enjoyed the films of greydon clark who is a no nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood and this is one of his best final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence i suppose if they remake this with the rock a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do 
__label__0 after watching a dozen episodes i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models i thought that my profession was being joked about i am not a mathematician instead a chemical engineer but i do work a lot with mathematical models so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to make believe of fairy tales first choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task charlie eppes is shown as a genius but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future individuals are erratic and haphazard there is no modeling for them isaac asimov even wrote about that in the 1950 s even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction second supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found the model parameters have to be known these parameters are the constants of the equations such as the gravity acceleration 9 8 m s2 and often are not easy to determine again charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses and after the model and the parameters are chosen they would have to be tested oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted third a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by numbers but also by sci fi movies the computational effort required for solving these models try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow and even with the right software hardware combination the model solution might well take days to be reached he solves them immediately i could use his computer in my research work i would be very glad as a drama it is far from being the best show the characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent for some layman the show might work for others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow 
__label__0 this movie bewilders me it may be that i m just a stupid american but i really just don t get 400 blows everything i ve read about this movie has been a total rave but i just couldn t stay interested i m sure that it was as revolutionary in film making as all the critics say but when it boils right down to it it s just really really boring maybe it s the language barrier may i m just not sensitive or artsy enough but whatever the case is i hated this movie the story itself isn t bad it s about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility that in itself ought to be interesting and it was at first there was nothing wrong with the dialogue but then again it s hard to say because half of the conversations weren t subtitled and for no apparent reason so i didn t always know what was going on but for the dialogue we could understand it made enough sense the actors were believable enough but it s hard to say what a real person would do in these situations so you feel for the main character but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think well that sucks the plot isn t even your typical plot each time he gets in trouble he gets into more trouble than the last time but the reasons never vary too much and through the entire film you realize that there s nothing the main character can really do about it so it s more like just waiting to see how it ends the ending by the way was completely over my head it s way too artsy for me and i just didn t get it leading up to the end was easy enough to follow the structure was certainly there and it made sense as well but everything was really drawn out for the amount of dialogue and significant moments the movie could have been an hour shorter it just didn t end part of it was the unnecessarily long shots none of which were especially memorable for example the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds now i m sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere but for the average viewer i d rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running like doing my laundry or taking a nap final verdict the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson if i could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions as it was i just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life 
__label__0 this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot this applies perfectly to redline the only thing about this movie that was a level were the cars the acting seemed forced and scripted the premise was flimsy at best and the plot was almost nonexistent i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and while it was pretty bad it could have been worse and at least it was entertaining i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie all in all don t pay for it don t go out of your way to see it but if it s on showtime or hbo and there isn t anything else on it s a decent distraction 
__label__1 to my surprise i quite enjoyed spacecamp i remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp however this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it but thats what i liked about it they don t make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change it was interesting to see kelly preston leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light fluffy plot absolutely loved the robot named jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters the film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think 
__label__1 as other reviewers have noted this is an unjustly neglected depression era film directed by frank borzage two oscars and written by jo swerling leave her to heaven the westerner lifeboat etc it is a tough minded well structured and realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown they re grifters beggars and women forced into prostitution but they re a community of people both good and bad with loyalties as complex as any group s perhaps primary among this movie s many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracy s character bill and loretta young s trina he tough talking physically aggressive and evidently fearless but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival while he blusters trina actually hangs tough if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike her devotion to him is obvious and complete when she becomes pregnant she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave or i ll even give up the kid if you ll only be happy such is the dignity of loretta young s performance at age 20 as a quite simple character that she seems neither weak or dependent but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more 
__label__1 documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops the film mardi gras made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country i had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling it was a great very informative movie and i d recommend anyone see it it kinda opens your eyes 
__label__1 when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers most people think of basic instinct and some maybe of showgirls but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies de vierde man this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing and above all the story is absolutely plausible which makes the whole experience even more intense the performances by jeroen krabbe renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional and verhoeven s direction does the rest de vierde man makes even basic instinct look quite tame it can t get much better than this a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema 10 out of 10 at least 
__label__1 every scene was put together perfectly this movie had a wonderful cast and crew i mean how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr in it none have and ever will exist he has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent this movie was perfect i saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in blockbuster and like it was calling out to me i couldn t resist picking it up and bringing it home with me you can call me a sappy romantic but this movie just touched my heart not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time even though it made me cry i admit at the end the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter i suggested to my horror action and pure humor movie buff of a brother who absolutely adored this movie this is a movie with a good sense of feeling it could make you laugh out loud touch your heart make you fall in love and enjoy your life every time you purposefully walk past this movie just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie who knows what if it could really happen to you and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life 
__label__1 this movie was very enjoyable though you ll only like it if you hate going to the dentist but aren t afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk you love horror moviesi particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character the fact that he s totally obsessed by cleanliness especially in the mouth and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud covered pool man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard liked it i give it an 8 
__label__0 as far as i can understand tiw watcher is the first work of a young director my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to oporto school of arts in the final credits nevertheless director ricardo pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema what is a movie how to tell a story it doesn t matter for the novice director one of the first things you learn in school when you re studying cinema is how to tell a story you learn that just like in novels in movies you should also construct your story in three acts the introduction the development and the conclusion you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax you learn this is valid for a 3 hour epic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30 second commercial you also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even deconstruct it in rough terms tim watcher introduces us its main character and then the movie ends the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in jeunet s amélie there are no second or third acts in tim watcher this is not a parody or an art film thus you can t even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure you are expecting to be told a story and it doesn t happen worst than that tim watcher defines itself as a warning and one with no real purpose it doesn t make a point or at least not a valid one its point is childish with a sense of vengeance the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is manichaean i was expecting a lot more from this short the movie opens with a rather good looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film i don t know the budget for this movie but judging for the thanks list in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where s difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score that s all there s nothing else there s no plot and that s a shame because it feels like a waste of production values hardly you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story as absurd as the comparison may sound i must refer the bmw shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over the top stylish cinematography 
__label__0 i m somewhat of a fan of lynche s work so i was excited when i found this dvd unfortunately i was very let down it s a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor the animation is very crude no doubt done using macromedia each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation they will probably be somewhat impressed by it however if you ve spent much time on newgrounds com like me then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you ve seen before many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd if lynch submitted this work to the website then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists but since i saw this on dvd instead of on newgrounds i give it a 4 10 instead of a 7 10 as i would have otherwise these cartoons are fit for the internet but with a name like david lynch on it i expected better quality both in story and in animation 
__label__0 i have a nice collection on movies going and this one was added to it number 274 to be exact the title had me going at first splatter university i thought this would be a great horror movie was i ever wrong don t get me wrong this is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it could have been a lot better i love all movies but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare poor audio quality poor acting and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved 3 out of 10 stars movie is ideal for a good laugh if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of then this is one 
__label__0 a family traveling for their daughter s softball league decide to take the scenic route and end up in the middle of nowhere the father is an avid photographer and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town he decides to take another detour to take some photographs of course the side show is filled with inbred freaks who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves the only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors other than that there s nothing worthwhile about the film 
__label__0 teamo supremo are three kids consisting of their leader captain crandall rope girl and skate lad all with their own battlecry buza chika woopa and outfit and moves they work for the governor kevin and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game they lead normal lives as well and have family and school duties but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains the villains all have rather unique and singular traits such as mister vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway from an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil and often strange plans to gain power take revenge etc the animation itself is quite nice and smooth but the style appears to be simple on purpose the backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic the music is quite nice and the show isn t too bad altogether although the style isn t my favourite the plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous but after all this is a cartoon and one can t blame them for that however this would not be in the same rank as fillmore or pepper ann 
__label__1 this anime seriously rocked my socks when the anime first opened itself i felt it was too slow the story wasn t quite moving forward and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead once he learns more about tracing and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together it was fantastic additionally i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world there wasn t any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on a few of the surprise people that show up gilgamesh seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another meaning we didn t have generic bad ass a being replaced by generic bad ass b as soon as a died anddd i loved the music the opening music rocked and the finishing theme from the final episode just seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more good job type moon 
__label__0 i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliant at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogy so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish i was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page even my favourite character who is gandalf did not seem interesting at all the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks they looked awful and aragorn and sam face i don t know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn t of got any better i just hope that nobody judges the books by this film 3 10
__label__0 when this film was released in 1997 the special effects such as they are were poor they would have been dated even for the 1980s and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better sfx work certainly no one involved in the production of this film was looking for an oscar it s a wild departure from director fred olen ray s usual stuff most of which has the word bikini in the title bikini pirates bikini chain gang bikini girls from the lost planet etc and are little more than t a flicks but here we are with a film rated u and aimed squarely at the kiddies you ve got to give him credit for diversifying this was a minor direct to video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels invisible mom 2 and invisible dad dee wallace stone whose career went downhill fast after 1982s e t plays the invisible mom of the films title and would return for the sequel russ tamblyn whose career had been in free fall even longer since 1961s west side story plays the villainous dr woorter it s probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month except maybe young trenton knight as josh it s rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie this child actor didn t work again after the sequel invisible mom 2 maybe the film was cursed after all he wasn t that bad in this film for a child actor he s pretty good no better or worse than any of his more experienced co stars as mentioned above the invisibility effects are naff to say the least the direction is poor the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about there are plenty of worse films out there though and for anyone under the age of about ten this film will no doubt be quite watchable most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though and i wouldn t blame them one bit 
__label__0 as a native film professor i can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with native content that i have ever viewed i would rather get a root canal than view this film again the use of stereotyping uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story line and bad script the writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying native people and communities if this person is native they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed if this person is non native they need to seriously re examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined unintentional racism or if they are intentionally being ignorant my only hope is that the native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts if you want to see good native films then check out christmas in the clouds dance me outside medicine river powwow highway smoke signals to name just a few 
__label__0 lolita is a rebel and she s going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between sci fi and fantasy well this surrender cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line but the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and jacqueline lovell as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show for lovell s fans only 
__label__1 okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d what it s not that hard to film in a car second the story isn t very good there are a lot of things wrong with it third why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh but don t waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap 
__label__0 this film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny tv sitcom in puerto rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film almost silencing all others coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners the weekly claridad is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film s form and content and pointed out all its flaws clichés and bad writing just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes and because one can recognize actors and scenery does not make it an acceptable film 
__label__0 there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson s fantastic mr fox unfortunately all the love is for himself granted there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny the worrying thing is that i think it was and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with the animation is good in the close up shots of the animals however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess there wasn t really anything special about the acting either with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better i m pretty sure george clooney s voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park one of them where he played a dog the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically despite the film being set in england all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is i didn t laugh once 
__label__1 anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuro s quest to avenge his mother s death but also grows up in the process the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuro s journey from boyhood to manhood the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated you can tell it s a 70 s movie and the animation is only slightly better than your average star blazers episode but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesn t matter a must see for any animation fan 
__label__1 titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it s few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch 
__label__1 this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellent the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here it s liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs well few actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant irritating puss he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else s here neeson is a man s man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this 
__label__1 laputa castle in the sky is the bomb the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack which is reused many times after this im not sure if this was the first time i heard it and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack sheeta the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy pazu is also a great role model he lives on his own the plot is classic miyazaki i won t give it away but the end is really great i rank this as one of miyazaki s three best with nausicaa and spirited away also you may want to check out howl s moving castle when it comes out sometime next year i hope if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa enjoy piper a
__label__1 the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something he uses his new found invisibility to torment tom and it s pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one joke cartoon and the action never leaves the interior of the house which is usually the trait of below average t j shorts still worth a 7 10 however i m not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself 
__label__0  spoilers let s start with the good of this film the serviceable acting of cynthia rothrock and richard norton the rest of the acting is awful this isn t aided by the atrocious script the worst culprit is the villain buntao the head of an asian crime syndicate played by frans tumbuan i was laughing my head off as he was expressing his fury over having lost a bunch of money horrid performance patrick muldoon isn t much better and his it s a hostile takeover line that s the remainder of the title of this film was delivered about as badly as one could do it there are no other main characters but no other actor actress distinguished him herself in this film we next come to the plot this should tell you all you need to know in the original rage and honor cynthia rothrock who plays chris fairchild was a teacher in the inner city now she s a c i a agent or was it some other governmental agency sorry but this film was so bad that i don t even remember hmmm i can imagine what that c i a application process was like interviewer what past job experience do you have chris i was a teacher interviewer okay you re hired i only give it a 2 because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end though we know that tommy muldoon the secret villain will be caught 
__label__1 i ve always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one when we first meet frank in the film s title role he s the brother of a notorious gunfighter who s out of town at the moment the brother strikes terror in the heart s of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him she s the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra s brother and he s coming to his town to take over they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town kirk follows him overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone it s a well acted performance almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm pity for some reason this has not been seen for years two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen he s a villain of incredible malevolence pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with let s just say i believe johnny concho was mgm s answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order

__label__1 after a dirty shame i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie that movie was really so bad that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie i decided to give it a try anyway only a couple of days later it was shown on television i taped it out of curiosity and now that i ve seen it i can tell you that this pecker sure is a lot better than a dirty shame in this movie we see how a young nobody from baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york he s a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby when he keeps his very first exhibition in the shop where he works his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness his photographs are sold for enormous prices but when he sees how his family friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him and they do but what they get to see there is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine it s not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than a dirty shame the first reason is that this movie has an actual story this movie really has something to say and isn t just intended to shock as many people as possible the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don t know what the reality is like isn t just funny it s not that far from the truth either i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it but apparently we are all supposed to like it the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer i m not saying that everything that you will see is great but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward furlong christina ricci overall this isn t a great movie but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes which never really go too far this is an enjoyable movie it certainly isn t the best comedy ever but i liked it a lot more than a dirty shame i give this movie a 6 5 10 
__label__1 this was without a doubt the best of the dirty harry series from the opening credits you re swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge eastwood has many aside sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but show harry at his bad assed best loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective action flicks this is the one dirty harry flick that s raw and devoid of any fluff i can watch this again and again okay not in one sitting because it s a gratifying out for revenge yarn the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable go ahead make my day you feel lucky punk classic eastwood as only eastwood with his anguished rubbery expressions and whispery menacing voice can do it 
__label__0 the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe i d recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment 
__label__1 yeah it is in fact it s somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies number 15 i think anyways i m usually not one for plots but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games final fantasy 7 for example and not movies but this one has it all vivid drawings of planets stars an extremely well written screenplay while this is not really for children they can still watch it it contains no graphic blood guts and silicone but i don t think they re going to understand it 
__label__1 whatever you become in your life you must never forget that you have roots this is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie i dare to say that this movie is well underrated this shows us a reality of life the more evil surrounds you the better person you become trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy without grudges without living under a rock the movie concept is more that interesting connecting the storytelling with real life events keeping us aware of everything from facts to emotions bless these people and make everyone happy see it i recommend it to all young people it s not about racism it s about how to live your life 
__label__1 maria braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband hermann an explosion ripped through the building to begin with and she and hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of rubble on the street perhaps this may strike some as a heavy handed metaphor for what s about to come marriage on the rocks so to speak it s a betrothal where the husband goes off to war and is held in a russian prison camp unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud maria who keeps standing by the depressing rubble of the train station as some come home others don t with a sign awaiting hermann trouble arises as happens in rainer werner fassbinder s melodramas and as its one of his best and most provocative we see as maria uncommonly gorgeous hanna schygulla in this role will do a two face she ll stand by her man even if it means working at a bar for american gi s and even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black gi and comes close to bearing his child that is naturally until he reappears and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe or working for a german businessman effectively sympathetic ivan desny and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company maria will do whatever it takes to be successful but she ll always be married it s hard to say there s anything about maria that isn t fascinating money sex power all of these become interchangeable for maria she s like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a sultry smile she gets to have a husband more or less actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film while obtaining things a man who dotes on her whenever he can a new and expensive house with servants a secretary money that others around her aren t getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere such as the secretary played interestingly enough by fassbinder s own mother maria is sexy confident and all alone with an idealized life going against a life that should be made in the shade she says of the two men the american soldier and poor old and sick oswald that she s fond of them and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and soul searching husband hermann sends from canada after being released from prison she s casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce but understand where she s coming from and going all the way fassbinder employs this inherent contradiction and moments with maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama for example hermann walking in on the jubilant and half naked maria and gi is just about a masterpiece of a scene with maria s reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he s there let alone alive while sticking to his guns as a director of such high minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable but it isn t really it s like one big metaphor for a country that after the war couldn t really move on to normalcy a few times fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background and we see maria walking around her family house hustle and bustle going on around her and the radio speaks of a divided germany of things still very unsettled of a disarray maybe the only way to cope is excess or maybe that s just my interpretation of it it s hard to tell really under schygulla s stare face and eyes anyway it s such an incredible performance really one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old time hollywood female star while with the down and dirty ethic of a girl of the streets most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband where she stars in one of those super lustful black lingerie pieces and high heels and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it that s almost the essence of what maria is and schygulla wonderfully gets it down a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her sometimes in a single sentence this is what fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his trilogy while i might overall prefer veronika voss as a masterpiece maria braun is perhaps just as good as a character study of what makes a woman tick and tock with almost nothing to lose 
__label__1 after seeing this excellent film over 100 times i still find new things that blow me away with this movie great special effects incredible acting and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well best movie ever 
__label__0 this is a truly terrible film i m only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy unutterably dull although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen then the credits rolled and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb over 5 stars when i last saw the voting are you people voting ironically please please please do not watch this film 
__label__1 this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence and i can think of no other movie documentary or drama that achieves it there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much yes it is about dmd and accessible travel on those issues alone it is a worthwhile venture but it is more it is about friendship it is about life itself about living every day that you re alive and it s a great fun adventurous narrative this is why god created the cinema see this movie 
__label__1 i was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare my comment i am watching my life though younger but only by 5 years or so than the rocket boys i remember the absolute urgency with which sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole science fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind my own tornado landed me in my own state s science fair in physics by 62 though our group was less successful in gaining the support of for example firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event our city went so far as to allow us to tour the nike missile site on chicago s lakeshore this movie brought it all back for me and i will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us ubernerds of the late 50s and early 60 s we are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country see it 
__label__1 what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has though i think that s probably because of the mention of beckham in the title more than anything else it s a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message you can do anything if you re determined enough and put your mind to it which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film i think this is one of keira knightley s better films and i think she s a brilliant actress and was excellent for the role parminder nagra was brilliant too sadly i can t say this for jonathan rhys meyers because i don t think that he was that much of a good actor and to be honest his eyes were a little scary all in all a brilliant film and a brilliant story
__label__0  mccabe and mrs miller takes place in the turn of the century pacific northwest into a soggy muddy mining camp john mccabe a hirsute warren beatty comes barging full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon whorehouse for the town replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history he also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha male credentials amongst the locals and thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour it looks to be a rather sorry operation until mrs miller julie christie shows up on a startling contraption that s half railroad car half automobile where did altman find that thing mrs miller immediately takes on mccabe as a business partner with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering noting that mccabe doesn t know how to add she also insists on handling the accounts it s not clear what mccabe s function will be the plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer mccabe to buy him out for five grand mccabe tells them to buzz off he s holding out for fifteen thousand the company finds negotiation distasteful so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill mccabe though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as mccabe s function in the whorehouse partnership excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn t cut the mustard when one considers that any reward money offered by the local marshal would be pretty tempting mccabe and mrs miller purportedly classic seventies cinema should be a lot better than it is the movie tells a pretty good story the main characters have the potential to be interesting there are some striking scenes especially one involving what looks to be a 14 year old stone cold killer but it s really really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing once again this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness according to the trivia sheet here on imdb the movie s editor griped to altman that the sound was muddy altman disagreed and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie s release altman blamed the editor nice along with the bad sound the movie has an atrocious look only robert altman can hire a world class dp like vilmos zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have got to be kidding me the interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum the exterior photography is even worse it s as if altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees during the climactic stretch when beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow fall that reminds one of a rankin bass christmas special look i can t watch a movie under these conditions get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes when you remove all that annoying altman esque overlapping dialog and when you wipe the lenses with some windex or something 3 stars out of 10 
__label__0 one of frances farmer s earliest movies at 22 she is absolutely beautiful bing crosby is in great voice but the songs are not his best martha raye and bob burns are interesting but their comedy probably great in its time is really corny today roy rogers also appears in a singing role in my view only worth watching if you are a frances farmer fan and possibly a bing crosby fan 
__label__0 i thought that this movie was pretty lame if you re looking for cheesey you may like this i myself don t mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies but even that isn t reason enough to see this flick 
__label__0 connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times that s it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness flared trousers big hair zapata moustaches etc this one isn t the script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad the title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly misleading i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague 
__label__1 at the academy awards ceremony on march 27 1957 dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her torrid over the top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a texas oil tycoon in written on the wind the 1956 potboiler adapted from robert wilder s novel was a veritable three ring circus showcasing alcoholism greed impotence and nymphomania malone s performance as marylee hadley a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart was representative of the movie as a whole mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the lowest common denominator melodrama written on the wind is ultimately the work of one man the incredibly gifted director douglas sirk an émigré from pre world war 2 weimar germany who left his european theater heritage behind to pursue a career in hollywood an extremely erudite man sirk made a name for himself in the 1950 s as universal studios reliable director of lavish soap operas most notably with ross hunter s productions of magnificent obsession all that heaven allows and imitation of life independent producer albert zugsmith offered sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of universal s demure entertainments and create a more adult sensational product hence the sultry wind and its follow up 1957 s tarnished angels both released under the universal international banner it s anyone s guess why sirk didn t pursue loftier themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities written on the wind could be considered sirk s epic soap opera indeed it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous perhaps more so robert stack not an actor typically known for over emoting nearly matches malone in intensity with his offering of the weak willed brother kyle hadley a mere shadow of his patriarchal father when he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride a beautifully leonine lauren bacall hadley goes off the deep end escalating an already serious drinking problem with a secret gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb both brother and sister as venal and unlikeable as they are are presented as victims of their past giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous and far more interesting than the good side of the family mainly bacall and the impossibly handsome rock hudson young hadley s old boyhood friend and business associate a surrogate son to the old man and malone s unattainable object of desire despite all the domestic co dependency on display it s not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed with a real panache for pictorial composition and editing director sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened technicolor cinematography imaginable every single shot in this film is an eye filling canvas of saturated colors from the sight of a tank like pink cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion s front doors to the garish decor of a luxury miami hotel a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity action and dramatic scenes feature sirk s adept use of tilted camera angles shadowy lighting and cross cut editing shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious drunken malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold what you re really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind gussied up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius 
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen however the little slave girl alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining alice s smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie 
__label__1 my all time favorite movie oscar caliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrence s best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel 
__label__1  the first war to be 100 outsourced dan ackroyd s line says it all this is a hard to describe film comedy satire action screwball it reminded once or twice of dr strangelove especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley who did a remarkable job i think i had no particular expectations of this film though i am a big john cusack fan so i just let the movie wash over me and as a result i was quite entertained the political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the us military business complex the sub plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us but for the rest of the world it is a timely tale 
__label__0 oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kong s love child it totally took away from the believability of the character now i knew there wasn t a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon so from then on the whole movie was shot for me the money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his i am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch hunters must watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie 
__label__0 it took 9 years to complete this film i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said hey this film is terrible i ve seen better acting in porn movies the story is tired and played abused child turns into serial killer how about something new for a change how about abused child turns into a florist at least that would have been a new twist why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea especially unoriginal movie ideas thinks that they can be a director i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed that shows tenacity and spirit with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer director from michigan see hatred of a minute if you want a good movie from a michigan writer director stick with evil dead 
__label__0 i had high hopes for this film since it has charlton heston and jack palance but those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so palance was ridiculous not even heston s acting or annabel schofield s beauty or brief nude scenes could save this film some of the space effects were quite good but others were cheesy the plot was ludicrous even sci fi fans should skip this one grade f
__label__1 what a pleasant surprise a disney dtv direct to video sequel that s actually good the lion king 1 1 2 is a comedy affair that involves everyone s favorite meerkat and warthog timon and pumbaa it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments until timon complains that we re not here yet after fighting over the remote timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience their story they start the new movie and the laughs begin to be honest i was losing hope in disney most of their direct to video fare has been aggressively awful with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original 1 1 2 decides to try something different it tells the original story from a new point of view okay it adds some stuff like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met but it s an interesting concept nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie there s also some neat movie parodies including one scene that simultaneously spoofs the good the bad and the ugly and cool hand luke and the script is filled with funny memorable lines added to the cast are julie kavner the simpsons as timon s worry wart mom and jerry stiller as timon s slightly crazy uncle max matthew broderick shows up as simba and his teen scene reminded me of ferris bueller everyone does well especially robert guillame is that how you spell it as rafiki who exudes more and more yoda speak in this movie timon comments on this several times the lion king 1 1 2 is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation 10 10
__label__0 i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7 40 i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches they exaggerated the way love works in reality all of the girls were stereo types the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks hey why didn t they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead it might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars 
__label__0 let this film serve as the death knell to the big twist films borne out of the 1990s known in some circles as the kyser soze syndrome this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by m night shayamalan and even ron howard used a variation in a beautiful mind however in revolver director guy ritchie known in some circles as mr madonna utilizes the soze motif in a far more obsequious manner jason statham with a highly questionable head of hair stars as jack green known to all as mr green he may or may not also be criminal mastermind mr gold or perhaps mr gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld i m not quite certain but i certainly don t care revolver is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess i ve had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time witness the fractured time structure the painful jump cuts the ceaseless inner monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence this everything and the kitchen sink directing style makes quentin tarantino s oeuvre look sedate the cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as i was watching it the film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to mr green i wanted to like green as i always enjoy stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else here though he struggles along like a remedial reader in a university english literature class his lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis macha ray liotta feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord liotta spits cries and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos there are no redeeming qualities to revolver it s yet another filmic faux pas from ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of swept away as his worst film yet 
__label__0 i love horror films low budget 50 s 60 s 70 s 80 s but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film let s compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the changeling the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better though still far from great demon seed ok i ll be fair let s compare it to made for tv horror films don t go to sleep waaay creepier and better done salem s lot the night stalker night gallery even don t go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better spoilers first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers terrible also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and it s a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or entity it s a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie margaret our protagonist now that i m on the topic of suzie another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse pours her heart out falls in the boiling pool struggling in agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her s life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but that s where the positives end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven t watched it since it originally aired or remembered it scaring them as children this film was pretty much merit less 
__label__0 the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli defence force come across a terrorist base this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script it grabs the reader audience and the introduction of david bannon as he rents a room from abby and russell quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who s not who he says he is however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that i ve seen
__label__0 following the success of paris je t aime a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york unlike the original film the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly by the time you think are getting into a story it s over in too many cases and the often start up and stop and then begin again with the stories woven together as a result there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure sadly however while paris je t aime was hit or miss mostly hit most of new york i love you was miss the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet and often quite terrible it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so now understand it was good quality music but its somber tone really really made me feel like cutting my wrists among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the crotchety old couple this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much and i really wanted to love this film i respected what they tried but simply didn t like it very much by the way and this is not really a complaint but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film for a recent film that was unusual in our more anti smoking culture also if you get the dvd there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film one consists of kevin bacon wearing a cool fedora eating a hotdog and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world including a very unhappy couple 
__label__0 in this strangely lackadaisical apocalypse the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu s famous short novel than my mother s lasagna recipe bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it the plot and i use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested anyone older beware 
__label__0 i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real talk about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination there s also the bad acting bad writing and bad special effects they are just all around terrible terrible movies yes believable and horrifying to a kid but i can t imagine a grown up buying into this shlock although i must say that i would be interested in seeing them today as an adult they might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them 
__label__1 first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in 1995 rappers were in it and that added to the flair of it remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn t until he met and was befriended by nazis they took him in nazi s aren t all this awkward but like most gangs they fill a void that is missing be it economic social emotional whatever michael rappaport played the part perfectly omar epps was the hot shot track star with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in until she was date raped she then found her self experiment with her sexuality and getting involved politically this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism people s own perspectives come into play i read so many comments about how there were no evil black characters but there were evil white one nazis so what remy wasn t portrayed as evil at all he was trying to find his way and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him he was scared it was sad to see him devolve how he did he even says right before he kills himself i didn t mean it i wanted to be an engineer ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates and generally appear to not like white people very much they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness sorry if this makes it seem unfair but are there really black groups like the nazis no people say it shows white bad black good not true the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police which is more or less true in real life kristen was a good girl her boyfriend omar epps roommate was a good guy and even remy was a good guy he was just misguided omar epps ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters angry and inconsiderate although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger remy s inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well good movie well done like all movies that deal with racism its a great piece to get a discussion going i don t think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though 
__label__1 this movie was a classic i would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a big throat and swallow are pride 
__label__0 this is an atrocious movie two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man there s not much to give away in regards to a plot or a spoiler i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick much of the film involves locke and camp cackling obnoxiously all the while grinning psychotically at the camera add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again including a vaudevillian song about dear old dad that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees the music is annoying at first then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen the theme here is of youth run amok understandable as a reaction to the 60s but done with little imagination or style avoid it 
__label__1 victor mclaglen s performance is one of the finest in film history i think we can all feel for gypo because we ve all struggled with what is right and what isn t and been wrong this was one of the first art house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio rko radio pictures joseph h august s cinematography is at its very best here however august s stunning portion was mostly overlooked he didn t receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved this is a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all conveyed with as little words as possible 
__label__0 i m afraid that i have to disagree with the majority i found spike lee s latest a wee bit boring although he was trying something different i e not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer i don t think it worked too well there s really a bit too much going on vinny john leguizamo and dionna s mira sorvino relationship ritchie s adrien brody lifestyle and then the local mafia types the story is good but at the end thats all you have 2 or 3 stories with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film there are some good points though all scenes with the son of sam killer david berkowitz look very nice colour saturation etc and the acting is pretty good throughout overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings it just wasn t strong enough in the end 
__label__1 it is not the same as the other films about dancing a few normal people found themselves from dancing unlike the dancing films in hollywood the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing this touches me very deeply 
__label__1 the title sequence shows the credits written on a rain soaked sidewalk as people trod on it music is provided by someone whistling alfred newman s street scene then we meet det sgt mark dixon dana andrews who always wanted to be something his old man wasn t a guy on the right side of the law but he s pretty vicious for a good guy after several complaints over his roughing people up his boss insp nicholas foley robert f simon demotes him foley tells him he s a good man but needs to get his head on straight and be more like det lt thomas karl malden who has just gotten a promotion meanwhile tommy scalise gary merrill in a splendidly slimy performance has an illegal dice game going and is looking to make a sucker out of the rich ted morrison harry von zell who was brought in by ken paine craig stevens and his beautiful wife morgan gene tierney she figures out too late her husband is using her as a decoy and paine strikes her when she refuses to play along the chivalrous morrison intervenes but paine knocks him out cold that seems to be the worst of it but later it turns out the guy is dead and paine looks guilty but this won t be paine s story soon dixon has fallen in love with morgan but not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible deed that he tries to cover up morgan s father a tale spinning taxi driver tom tully may take the rap for it it s up to dixon to try to pin the blame on scalise otto preminger directs a script credited to ben hecht and three others from the novel night cry by william l stuart this is a solid film noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and murky morality we expect from this genre it holds up until the brightly lit ending which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors of course the classic noir directed by preminger and starring andrews and tierney is laura you ll enjoy this but you can t miss that 
__label__0 twist endings can be really cool in a movie it s especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes but we just don t pay attention those type of twist endings are the one s that make people think then we ve got twists like this film has twists that whether or not you pay attention you have no clue what s going to happen when they reveal this kind of random twist instead of shock it s somewhat a dumbfounded reaction this film starts off like it s going to be an interesting take on horror but after about 20 minutes it s nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist three young women are going to a concert so they get lost traveling through the woods and hit a tree trunk they end up at some old creepy lady s house who hates men and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion laurel munson strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher this film is too caught up in it s dialogue and it s always between only a few characters we have the main three girls the creepy spinster and the old lady and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five to make matters worse they never have anything interesting to say it s actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations we want to know what s going on and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothing plot holes are abundant here the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere wow three miles a two hour or less walk will kill them why didn t they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town did he have a one seater how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay rarely even checking up on each other why did this have to have so many dumb twists maybe the answers are in the boring script having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea it s not thrilling it s not scary and the ending is definitely out there but undoubtedly dumb my rating 1 2 out of 79 mins r for nudity and violence 
__label__1 how to lose friends and alienate people came out in 2008 it bombed at u s box offices it s an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast simon pegg is great playing sidney young who wrote the book how to lose friends and alienate people i know it s not a true story the only way i know that is because sidney wants to go out with an actress named sophie maes sophie maes doesn t exist but other than that the film could be real how to lose friends and alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008 and i think you definitely should see it as i said earlier the film has a fantastic cast including kirsten dunst spider man the virgin suicides danny huston the number 23 30 days of night gillian anderson the x files megan fox transformers confessions of a teenage drama queen jeff bridges the big lebowski the vanishing overall how to lose friends and alienate people is hilarious i think simon pegg and kirsten dunst do work well together and i think you should see it though there is some odd nudity including trans sexuals it s a hilarious and awesome comedy one of simon pegg s best the plot sidney young a journalist from england travels down to new york to work at sharp magazines while there he meets an actress named sophie maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does 
__label__0 lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii then he quipped the less said about that the better indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter it was a film to be taken seriously like other good original films filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front there is absolutely nothing scary about it it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning okay i ll cede ferdy mayne too lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things check out that ending with him and stirba lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania the story isn t really worth examining here and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise sybil danning is here and yes she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again one reviewer said 17 times i counted ten but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point i gave the film three stars but it really deserves a zero the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms danning s contributions yuck 
__label__0 starts really well nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success let s be honest heder s acting was pretty poor keaton daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length the ending is about as predictable as they come so predictable i ve ticked the spoilers box for this one line my advice avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do listen to or watch and even then you ll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life 
__label__1 i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest gump you would like this movie you can t compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite just my opinion i m sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn t for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i like i couldn t stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie 
__label__1 the question is can a movie this entertaining really be considered a bad movie my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words vestron pictures on it vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films suburbia and class of 1984 we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was your basic plot as is follows grange this goombaesque thug from planet earth robs the bank of the moon and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet i don t even remember the planet s name to mine for bauxite and other minerals the governor of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor walker a bounty hunter apparently one of only three on the whole planet reminds the prisoners that there is no escape because there s only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they d have him to deal with then there s the nameless colonel a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare much of the movie centers around futuristic car chases dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides with explosions galore the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid 80s i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl but it s definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack i can t even remember the names of the bands they re listed in the credits other than exploding white mice because that was the only one i d heard of before i saw this movie but i m definitely looking into them basically the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends 
__label__0 adrianne should really get a life without mr brady she nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show it s pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death this makes them look sound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet i know these disagreements are all part of life i guess to some people this is entertainment if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash though i would not be terribly surprised can t even stand the commercials for this show anymore i hope they re getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week however the a girl has one heck of great butt 
__label__1 this is a perfect series for family viewing we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america it is an up to date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike our teenager and tween ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching robin s next exploits we can t wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free on demand viewing the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion there is a moral to each story it is entertaining the violence is not over the top or needless the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john william s feel to it it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting reality tv to senseless violence you should take this for what it is and that is an updated robin hood not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn this is a gem to be enjoyed by all parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight maid marian is also an appealing role model for young girls rather than stand by and do nothing she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the night watchman the sheriff of nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim curry guy gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor one that makes most women wish he didn t have portray the role of a bad guy the only question we have is where is friar tuck 
__label__0 this is just horrible really horrible trash yes we ve got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex but while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie may have even been a hit as a porn movie this tries to mask itself as a film with actual things to say with real emotion and struggle it isn t it s an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time i m sure all of these women and men in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s but not in the actual movie business the acting was hackneyed so bad i mean real terrible the writing was even worse i can t lay all blame on these actors they had nothing to work with the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar as a sniper these shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough if there was more writing better writing much better writing and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with this movie should have been shot made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along it would have made more money it practically is a hardcore porn film already and it remains the only non porn movie i ve seen that shows a male erect penis 
__label__0 tierney s an authentic tough guy but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner just count the times tierney s incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts the old cliché about it only happening in the movies applies here in spades then there s the guy playing the watchman who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy ruining the menacing mood in the process the static one room sets don t help either and neither does director feist s obvious lack of feel for the material then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay off and the results are pretty flat in fact the movie only picks up in the station house scenes where hard bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent looking gas station attendants too bad that tieney s career never really gelled i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another his ice cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough guy best anyway this project might have worked as a radio play but as a movie with a promising noir title it s a disappointment 
__label__0 seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970 myra breckinridge has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released gore vidal s 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement most filmmakers felt that the novel s story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry insiders were surprised when 20th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen but studio executives soon had cold feet vidal s adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves rewrite upon rewrite followed the cast sensing disaster became increasingly combative in her dvd commentary star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra s motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film in the accompanying back story documentary rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself the basics of vidal s story are there but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications it seems to have no point in and of itself everything runs off in multiple directions nothing connects and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce the only laughs generated are accidental chief among these accidents is mae west it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one liner but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling to say the least but worse really is the fact that west is outside her era her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self caricatures ever seen on film the remaining cast is largely wasted raquel welch a significantly underestimated actress plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids non actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron but the entire role is essentially without point only john huston and cameo players john carradine jim backus william hopper and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed yes it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow slow when it should be fast relentlessly unfunny from start to finish it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action but by and large whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one the how and why of that is made clear in sarne s audio commentary sarne did not like the novel or for that matter the subject matter in general he did not want to write the screenplay but he needed the money he emphatically did not want to direct the film but he need the money he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed at one point he flatly states that reed is not a nice person and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their homosexual agenda which when you come right down to it seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal s novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take off on it although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people when taken in tandem with the film itself sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making of documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been printed to black and white the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored but the documentary details what they were the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine but to end where i began this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians movie buffs and cult movie fans i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone but everyone else should pass it by gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
__label__0 when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words i m not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of us people like morvern do no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a point possibly the sum of the entire story is the point and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesn t substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing this is not the usual complaint of a book lover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half educated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance despite morvern s own self characterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working class scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldn t deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldn t get out of my head was his character s attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person who s always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical and that doesn t begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morvern s responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a cross section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book i can see this the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting she s rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesn t have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morvern s responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy serio comic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isn t at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isn t scottish the actress said in an interview she hadn t had time to study up the accent and she ought to be it s important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story morvern s spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest what s left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead 
__label__0 i was lying on my bed with a really bad cold or flu or whatever i figure maybe i d kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago i wish i never picked this movie after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up afterwords when i got better of course i did some research on dennis l rader and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don t eat or you ll feel the way i felt after i first watched it i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus 3 at least that movie had better reviews on this site 
__label__1 this film is one of the finest american b movies of the 90s if you re looking for a serious film look elsewhere however if you re looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching everyone chews the scenery a bit but that s really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together 
__label__1 the title overstates the content of this movie somewhat which might lead to some unrealized expectations frankly speaking there s very little panic in the streets to be seen here in fact throughout the movie very few people actually know that there s a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters having said that what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because unlike the people in the streets the viewer knows what s going on and that director elia kazan builds very deliberately as the plague infected killer is sought one of the more interesting sidebars i found was the developing relationship between dr reed richard widmark and police captain warren paul douglas at the beginning the two really don t like each other even though they have to work together by the end they ve forged a real bond of respect for each other kazan did a good job with that pretty much all the performances here were excellent widmark and douglas were great and i was quite taken with a very early look at jack palance playing what would become his typical heavy role i found very little to criticize here perhaps barbara bel geddes came across as a little bit flat as reed s wife nancy but her role wasn t really central to the story all in all an excellent piece of work 9 10
__label__0 oh man what was sam mraovich thinking what was anyone who was involved in this film thinking mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ben and arthur director writer producer also executive producer caster lead star you name it he did it and he mraovich sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making so what is wrong with this film everything the film is about two gay lovers ben jamie brett gabel and arthur mraovich groan ben and arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people to make things worse ben s crazy ex wife they don t exactly divorce tammy julie belknap is steaming mad that ben s left her for another man and demands ben that they get back together saying that she can be gay too and arthur s christian devoted excessively hypocritical equally batty as tammy brother victor is hell bent on making arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church the film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ie ben and arthur fly to vermont to get married they go there on alaska airlines and vermont has palm trees they fly back on a fedex cargo plane hope they were comfy in a wooden crate plus many many more and plot holes to boot victor calls killing arthur the final plan which later changes to the final deed arthur and the private intern detective drive the same car blah blah blah the actors are all very bad and are way way over the top the script is laughably horrible one such example is i don t make sense you don t make sense i make sense that s who makes sense and there so much more wrong with the movie that i can t write them all down however the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ben and arthur is that sam mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic see his fake reviews for ben arthur and obvious comments by him on youtube mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is so to conclude forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever ben and arthur will knock them right off that title even paris hilton movies look like the dark knight compared to the monstrosity known as ben and arthur 
__label__1 dreamquest is by far the best porn movie i ve ever viewed this is a must see and if you re skeptical about your little ones watching it just skip over the naughty scenes of course this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes but even then it s enjoyable this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie even shawshank redemption 
__label__1 entertaining jim belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of it s a wonderful life michael caine plays a sort of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had made it big jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton not an oscar contender but good warm hearted fun 
__label__0 s i c k really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box the budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i m sure it s better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding 
__label__0 this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes weren t funny actors weren t funny anything about it wasn t even remotely funny don t waste your time for this only positive things about this were the beautiful wives and molly shannon who i m sure tried her best but the script was just too awful that s why i rated it 2 instead of 1 but it s definitely one of the worst films i ve ever seen :)

__label__1 this is an excellent example of early bette davis talent the production is above average for 1936 timeframe i cannot understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on dvd owners please please release it i would buy it immediately i have not seen it in more than thirty years on television but remember it well 
__label__1 the 1967 in cold blood was perhaps more like the real thing think about it would we really want to see the real thing but it was black and white in a color world and a lot of people didn t even know what it was and there was an opportunity to remake it for television plus if you remake it you can show some stuff not shown in the original the book in cold blood by truman capote was the first nonfiction novel truman s book was in fact not 100 true to the real story i thought the canadian location sufficed for kansas pretty much for a tv movie look for the elements of sex drugs and rock n roll dick s womanizing perry being an aspirin junkie perry playing blues guitar 
__label__1 i saw this on a flight over to the u s and was a little sceptical at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them however i didnt find this at all the film is fast but this is due to the nature of the director and the star the chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but isnt that true of most films the main villain is a bit of a let down christopher eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been but that said its still a good film 
__label__1 this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen s masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too it s just that it s almost like a different story altogether it s very light and fluffy you don t see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the churchill fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non existent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet s proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill s in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage for frank churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow s is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale s awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one 
__label__1 i can tell you just how bad this movie is i was in the movie and i haven t seen it yet but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk especially considering what we did that year the thing is that they probably over edited it especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute they probably should have followed him around we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can t really remember anything i was the mc in a few scenes from what i m told what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world or the girl that loser lost his virginity to overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them 
__label__0 the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ somehow according to the plot god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it s self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer the lead character an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it s self meanwhile with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people s beliefs it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment silly
__label__1 i haven t seen this in over 20yrs but i still remember things about it this film could not have been made in color the stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the 1950 s what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap i don t think i could watch that again once is plenty it s like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as well some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in 1794 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense 
__label__1 although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb yaara studying at princeton returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend talia because yaara practically lived with her friend s parents after the death of her own mother she has lost her adoptive sister and because yaara blind from birth has been guided and guarded by talia her friend s suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable inevitably the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death though without sight she has insight though she cannot see she is able to find what is out of sight than the normal people around her the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia in her adoptive family s house in tapes diaries and people in talia s past and present told from yara s point of view the film is also seen from her point of view as she visualizes what she hears believes and imagines the solution to the mystery is rather conventional but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare that the pat moment is easily forgiven the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably clarifying not only talia s life but also her relationship with yaara tali sharon as yaara uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl we accept fully her ability by the film s end to find her place in the world more confidently noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious the dead on acting by the minor characters and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager i will quibble with yaara s final declaration as stands with gadi talia s last boyfriend at a cliff s edge but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled 
__label__1 the full title of this film is may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you re dead a rewording of the old irish toast may you have food and raiment a soft pillow for your head may you be 40 years in heaven before the devil knows you re dead first time screenwriter kelly masterson with some modifications by director sidney lumet has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but here very sensible manipulation of the flashback flash forward technique of storytelling by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong andy hanson philip seymour hoffman is a wealthy executive married to an emotionally needy gina marisa tomei and addicted to an expensive drug habit his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money andy s ne re do well younger brother hank ethan hawke is a life in ruins he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha amy ryan is behind in alimony and child support and has borrowed all he can from his friends and he needs money andy proposes a low key robbery of a small mall mom and pop jewelry store that promises safe quick cash for both the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men s parents charles albert finney and nanette rosemary harris andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery but though hank agrees to the fail safe plan he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car the robbery is horribly botched when nanette filing in for the regular clerk shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies charles and andy and hank and their respective partners are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances and while we have come to expect that from hoffman hawke tomei finney ryan and harris it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful it is not an easy film to watch but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be grady harp

__label__1 this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films basic instinct robocop and total recall among others he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve an annoying self centered writer with a morbid imagination gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea side town an hour or so from amsterdam verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard s imagination twists reality asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper and it says boom i read doom when it says flood i read blood when it says red i see dead when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it i lie the truth he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer a beautiful wealthy salon owner as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died he begins to imagine she is a black widow is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory i figured out is my favorite gender looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven s too and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality it s a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that stuck 
__label__0 when i am watching a film i am aware that it is just a movie but nonetheless i do like to allow myself to become engrossed as much as possible under the circumstances i think this is what makes us cry scream laugh or otherwise react emotionally as audience members even though deep down we know it is just a movie what i don t want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that i am unable to slip into the aforementioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the film this film s director chose to frequently use multi angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen maybe it is just me but i find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating they might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading attention this is just a movie do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed if i want picture in picture i ll activate it from my tv remote but never during a movie i want to enjoy 
__label__0 i confess emma in my opinion is the single greatest novel ever written it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here unfortunately this is at best a palimpsest comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch there are some good elements here kate berkinsale having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm clearly emma s smarter spiritual twin is a wonderful emma raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill the production is handsome but the interiors are far too dark however there are several major problems the first is mark strong first of all he doesn t look right for mr knightley this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson it s badly out of tune the second problem is one of length simply put the film is much too short to get the right kind of feel it would need to be twice as long finally and most significantly there is the quality of the adaptation austen is an adapter s dream all the dialogue is there already it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly andrew davies seems to think otherwise first this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing emma should be is gloomy more significantly davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast what planet or minor work of thomas hardy is this come from it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon perfection watch the paltrow version or watch kate in cold comfort farm 
__label__1 i just saw this delightful japanese feature film at the 5th annual roger ebert overlooked film festival in the historic virginia theatre in champaign illinois although this film subtitled in english has ballroom dancing as its heart the film actually shows the world outside of japan how the rigid structures of family employment salaryman and recreation still exist in modern day japan writer director suo masauki i follow japanese custom of presenting the family name last name first and the given name last uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of japan also i shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with japanese formal names which may confuse i will refer to theactors by their professional acting name as listed in the internet data movie base he enlists the aid of his real life wife professional ballet dancer kusakari tamiyo in her first and so far only motion picture she is a dance teacher at her father s dance studio yet her real ambition is to compete once more in an international dance competition which she was disqualified from in the past no i won t say why see the movie salaryman yakusyo koji is the main star of the film a veteran of about 25 films since 1979 he gives a sterling performance of a 40 s something companymanwho has a lovely wife teenage daughter and just purchased the house of hislonging and yet something is missing from his own inner happiness see this film to learn how he becomes involved with ballroom dancing and secretly goes tolessons most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditionaljapanese hierarchy of social structure they are friendly and warm and inviting of course this is in sharp contrast to how japanese society is structured with it s place for everyone and everyone in its place philosophy the movie has so many funny moments the almost 1 500 theater goers brokeinto spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments this provesthat comedy has no foreign language veteran actor takenaka naoto is funny and brilliant as well as watanabe eriko they are two funny character actors one could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in japan or you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how thepeople of japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure watching the movie shall we dansu is a quick immersion into further study and viewing otherjapanese films i recommend this film to all it s funny it s charming it will make you cry a little and it will warm your heart 
__label__1 first of all i need to say that i m portuguese and it s not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even none and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when leão da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsação zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common this one is also good not of the same kind because it isn t a true comedy in fact it s officially a drama a woman s drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix if you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured 
__label__1 we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new york s mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this movie i understand that i can t name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but that s not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer

__label__0 full house is one of the worst tv series ever why because all the characters are so irritating that it s impossible to bear the best character is joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally an that girl dj who wrote her character i want to kill my self every time she speaks not to mention when danny start s with his philosophy example dj won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino however she s not eighteen so she shouldn t gamble according to law however the casino was ready to pay her the money but then danny her father cought s her and don t let s her raise that money because she is not eighteen oh come on give me a break will ya since i ve seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television some of the thing s they say in this series not even a child would bought who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny every single word they say in this series seem s like shakespeare wrote it except that shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn t be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house for everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world i deeply recommend do not watch the full house not even one episode as a try out avoid this series save your self from stupidity and nonsense this is the worst television show ever i d rather watch teletubbies then this do not watch this 
__label__0 if the scale went negative i would be happier seeing sushmita sen was nice and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story the choice of angles choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story oh if the songs and dances haven t caused you to rip your ears off your head first the film could have been made twice at 1 25 hours and been pretty good kinda like seven samurai but the director and writer didn t go that direction even if the townsfolk finally find their backbone and want to help this movie fails on so many levels editing writing photography angles style lighting script name any aspect of this film it was bad probably the food from the caterer was bad too i have never in 6 years of watching indian bollywood movies seen something this badly made 
__label__0 jeux d enfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just don t know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow older and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great people one could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away from avoid avoid avoid 
__label__0 i dislike this movie a lot if you ve read the puzo s books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one you re going to agree with me compared with the corleone s saga presented by puzo s novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movie it is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleone s saga in the 90 s and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i don t know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didn t fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film s qualities what will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario puzo shouldn t have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzo s novel the last don is a 90 s story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii 
__label__1  five days is billed as something special a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes each set on one particular day of a police enquiry but in fact this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories in fact one almost can t help drawing comparisons to the last prime suspect as one of the sub plots focuses on a single cynical female cop approaching retirement and it s not just the absence of helen mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable there s a lot of earnest over emoting manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic in another suspicious and it s possible to guess the guilty party well before the end not because of the internal dynamic of the story but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole certain things must be true to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times in spite of these failings the series grew on me by the end i was quite gripped but it s a sad sign that the bbc which once made the likes of the singing detective boasted of this of possibly the best drama of the year for there s little true originality on offer here and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing five days is in fact not rubbish but it is formulaic and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh 
__label__1 the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift sure justice good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts it is in fact one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan as played by clint eastwood so popular he carries a badge and works within the law but at heart harry is a vigilante meting out justice his way which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors as well as the criminals he s pursuing but it s what draws the audience anyone who s ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it even if it s only on the screen and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done and quickly is one of the elements that makes sudden impact directed by and starring eastwood so successful in this one the fourth of the series while working a homicide harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own with one exception whoever it is he s definitely not carrying a badge in his own inimitable way inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time so he does as only dirty harry can in a small town north of san francisco harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m o employed by the perpetrator unaccountably harry encounters resistance from the local police chief jannings pat hingle who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere not one to be deterred however harry continues his investigation which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist jennifer spencer sondra locke gradually harry discovers a link between the victims the burning question though is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture eastwood is in top form here both in front of and behind the camera and it is arguably the second best of the five film series right behind the original dirty harry it had been seven years since the last harry offering the enforcer 1976 but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director s chair as he is able to recapture the essence of not only his own character but that spirit that made these films so successful and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between s 3 and 4 as with all the films he directs eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end the screenplay by joseph stinson is well written and formulated to that distinctive dirty harry style the dialogue is snappy and the story itself conceived by charles b pierce and earl e smith is the most engaging since the original dirty harry as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama rather than entirely upon the action the characters are well drawn and convincing and of course this is the film that gave us one of harry s best catch phrases go ahead make my day as harry clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular he lives by a personal moral code a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear possibly more so today than ever before no matter who we are or where we come from there s undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry or at least have him around dirty harry is an icon of the cinema and it s impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him for better or worse eastwood is dirty harry without question just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone sherlock holmes sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer a young woman wronged and out for vengeance or as she sees it justice she manages to bring a hard edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character with a convincing introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the action genre even amid the violence locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood s harry and becomes in philosophy and deed something of his counterpart in supporting roles two performances stand out paul drake as mick creates the best psycho since andy robinson s dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original dirty harry with actually very limited screen time drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience this is the guy you can t wait to see harry take care of in the end also effective is audrie j neenan who makes her character ray parkins the epitome of the proverbial low life who can be found in any bar in any city it s a performance that evokes a gut level response and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism the supporting cast includes albert popwell horace mark kevloun bennett and nancy parsons mrs kruger with a perfect blend of drama and action sudden impact dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality the perfect justice of a not so perfect world that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience 9 10 
__label__0 me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good but we were wrong first of the acting wow the acting was the worst the effects were really bad as well it seemed like a film a college kid made the plot was pretty good but it d been done the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors the main guy was the worst actor ever it s a shame i m even calling him an actor the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny so if you want a good laugh see it but other than that stay far away from this one i usually love b list movies and such but this one i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video this one is the worst i ve seen and i ve seen some bad ones 
__label__1 this is such a fantastic movie a western about a self concerned man jimmy stewart going up to the klondike for gold on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska john mcintire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he hassles back mcintire threatens that he ll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire s town ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions jay c flippen and walter brennen who plays stewart s best friend builds a saloon a hollywood front for a whorehouse and tries to run the town s restaurant and hang out place out of business she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up too in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked spur the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 99 9 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy like the naked spur the far country boasts beautiful on location cinematography the landscape is gorgeous stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 rear window i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human and the supporting performances are universally fantastic in addition to those i ve mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good and i ought to single out walter brennen as well he seems to have specialized in playing best friends his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man the screenplay is very well written and mann s direction is impeccable a masterpiece 10 10 
__label__0 after seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller setting it in the competitive world of computer companies the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good but when i didn t go to watch it in it s first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss patiently i waited for it s dvd release then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening s viewing the anticipation on the way home was far better than the film for a start the direction is appalling there s no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself so he can appear in the film i wouldn t be rushing out to employ him in the future secondly the lead role is completely miscast as ryan phillipe phillipe normally the cool character as in cruel intentions and way of the gun but in this he s supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he s running and having geeky friends but he just doesn t look right the female stars rachel leigh cook and clare forlani don t feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests the only highlight of the film is tim robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it s his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along the final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don t see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the dvd causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story 
__label__1 i rented this some years ago the video store had only vhs at the time straight to video was hitting it s strides you know where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films i didn t know what to expect other than what was printed first thing i thought while watching was what the hells wrong with the sound obviously there was no dialogue dubbing words echoed so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention mind you there s no shakespeare here just simple talk the story is simple enough boy meets girl etc what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didn t seem like caricatures written into the story but rather non actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs uniforms included all the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor people hurting their privates using vulgarities this couldn t have hurt the marketing there was something honest about it i thought if they d have a bigger budget then it would have been better which i m sure they considered daily but they went ahead and made it this i felt was what independent film making is all about the word indy is thrown around as if it s a genre ha that s funny

__label__1 probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet not surprising since king himself wrote the screenplay the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house one of the other residents is jud a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard the other is a path leading to the pet sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway soon enough ellie creed s cat church is found dead luckily this happens while the family with the exception of louis the father is away for thanksgiving jud takes louis to another burial ground beyond the pet sematary where church is to be buried later louis is greeted not so politely by church he s returned appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in maybe he was buried alive maybe not nothing more i can say without ruining the story of all the king adaptions i ve seen this would be the most terrifying the characters are real and the situations are normal mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever then of course we have the conclusion easy to determine what s going to happen but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing moments overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption if you enjoy being scared and don t mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then pet sematary is just what you re looking for non horror fans will want to avoid this

__label__1 i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour i was really confused about who was who for example bill paxson s character had long hair and was wearing a jacket then when all the males arrived at camp it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson but wasn t i said where s bill paxson then there was a guy with his girlfriend he said she was 21 this was supposed to be a 20 year reunion of the camp director s alan arkin most memorable later on this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased one guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend alan arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth the best part was that none of the grown up campers were successes in life none of them had very great careers this seemed very real life the movie was compared to the big chill in some ways it wasn t as exciting as the big chill but it was a lot more realistic so even though the beginning is not promising the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one 
__label__1 i saw this movie when it first came out it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture justine priestley is hot as the psychotic but complex amanda this is not your ordinary psycho movie lots of interesting and original slants on the genre sort of a fatal attraction for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amanda s affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off 
__label__1 the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again however i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director attenborough s credits that puzzles me aren t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film 
__label__1 de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé who also adapted this story for the screen some really top class acting not only by van huêt but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must see especially if you liked spoorloos the vanishing s original screen adaptation 
__label__1 this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams laurel hardy and abbott costello the connection here is the year 1940 that s the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach i ll mention the significance of the latter later on besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun it s also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james finlayson who appeared in most of their films it s also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin hatley who composed their theme song which would be known as the cuckoo song dance of the cuckoos their score and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film if there is a more gag laden structure than usual in this l h film it s nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny that includes most of the sound and visual effects the latter provided by longtime roach staffer roy seawright in this one ollie has hornophobia from working at a noisy horn factory so dr finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest ollie doesn t like to go boating so stan suggests they just rent one that s docked so they wouldn t have to go anywhere after they find one they like we find out that convict nick grainger richard cramer has just escaped i ll stop there and say this was as good a finale for l h s longtime home as one could hope for it s hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it oh and i have a couple more lasts to mention it s the final film appearance of both harry bernard who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering stan and ollie as a policeman and that of ben turpin the cross eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of baton rouge whose second l h appearance this was having previously married the boys in our wife the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment all right i mentioned 1940 being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios it was also the first year that a comedy team both born in the state of new jersey would make their first picture at what would be their home studio universal the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l h in the flying deuces the previous year his name was a edward sutherland p s it was during this filming that script supervisor virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled up carpet that incident caused oliver babe hardy to send her roses to her hospital room they fell in love and married on march 7 1940 it lasted until babe s death in 1957

__label__1 though derivative labyrinth still stands as the highlight of the mid half of the six year old show finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor it s not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of truth justice and the american way on a weekly basis with very little variation his performance permitting him to show how one might react if he she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite believable welling rose to the occasion marvelously as always michael rosenbaum as the handicapped lex delivered as did kristen kreuk as a too sweet to be believed lana allison mack the ever present chloe also scored as a slightly off her rocker version the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama 
__label__1 it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed kiefer sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president it also concerns a mole traitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction 
__label__1 picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper stylized black and white visuals of frank miller s sin city then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as steven spielberg s minority report or richard linklater s a scanner darkly an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman s bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although volckman s work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance volckman s end result justice the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci fi drama which serve to compliment each other s storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation the film s title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling work volckman s film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film s highlight superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous the film s english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman karas and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister s disappearance he is investigating despite a wavering english accent romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega corporation avalon ian holm s reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes all together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms for fans of either of the film s intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch 8 10
__label__1 was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so i turned to my twin sister and said hey this looks like fun truly i love documentaries so we started watching it at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality i cried watched some more laughed got up to get another kleenex then cried some more once jonni kennedy s time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free i highly recommend this if you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart 
__label__1 having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it doesn t every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments and this movie isn t bad at all the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties films were pretty much a happy medium back then the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television i don t know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes teen idol pat boone plays nick conover a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta jeanette nolan and uncle jed arthur o connell out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son jed jr so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums story lines like this being what they are jed and nick don t really care for each other too much of course jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors fran dolores michaels and liz shirley jones templeton immediately jed develops a crush on fran and of course i don t have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed then there s the matter of uncle jed s horse a trotter who has turned wild and won t let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises doesn t matter though you ll enjoy yourself anyway once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone as a supposedly bad boy you ll have no trouble with the rest of the film considering that boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick certainly the role doesn t require much depth but still it s a nicely done job when you would least expect it as jed arthur o connell is the perfect choice for the role in the early going he is unreachable and cold but as he slowly warms up to nick we see that he s really a pretty good guy jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents as liz she s gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times dolores michaels as fran who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertaining the best thing about april love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen not one true villain in the whole thing everybody is so darn likable you can t help but enjoy the film i truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them another thing i really liked is that they didn t fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it as a matter of fact you ll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn t skimp in that department the chemistry between jones and boone is good best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect this movie will never be confused with great cinema yet sometimes instead of going to disneyland one just needs a nice outing in the park and that s what april love is my grade b 
__label__1 yes i m sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and it s theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although far fetched is romantic makes one believe in happy endings 
__label__1 everyone is either loving or hating this film i am going with loving it is so well shot and so well acted beautiful this film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making if you are not a fan of well done films of course you would hate this but if you like the tops of acting photography story and development look no further then here 
__label__0  i m working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and i m starting to get confused about who i really am sh t i ve got a headache and things are going wobbly oh no here comes another near subliminal fast cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic images i rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable why cypher is a cheap derivative dull movie set in a poorly realised bland futureworld with wooden leads and a laughable ending an eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran video it s painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little babylon 5 cgi set pieces this sub fight club sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allow cool blue moodiness served up with po faced seriousness disappointingly dumb this is not intelligent sci fi this is the plot of a computer game 
__label__0 i read the book a long time back and don t specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it since i m home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey it is a lifetime movie the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses the female cast is right out of desperate housewives i ve never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist is there nothing original anymore sure but not on lifetime the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose in one scene a female is struggling with a male for her life and what does she do kicks him in the testicles what else women love that but let me tell you girls something it s not as easy as it s always made to look it wasn t all bad i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that 
__label__1 i was initially dubious about this movie merely because of the subject but the richly drawn characters the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it well worth watching i initially had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves i am still haunted by the final scene 
__label__0 they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is hands down the worst twilight zone episode i ve ever seen it s completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable this one was completely out of place compare this to legendary episodes like a stop at willoughby or midnight sun and you realize there is no comparison buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money there s no other explanation 
__label__1 since the title is in english and imdb lists this show s primary language as english i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing 2000 as presented in the bandai released dvd set my actual review for the whole series is under imdb s entry of shin kidô senki gundam w 1995 very little is changed in respect to plot script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in purists can stick to japanese all they want but for a more realistic experience i recommend the english track since all the characters except heero yuy are not japanese most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non japanese asians for one thing the characters personalities come across more directly than in the japanese version the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give or take performances but a very well cast group of actors wing gundam s pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity voiced by mark hildreth who s deadpan delivery can be criticized as bad acting but it matches heero s personality very well deathscythe gundam s duo maxwell ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show masterfully played by scott mcneil he may sound a little too old for his age but duo s english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one trowa the pilot of heavyarms is a lost lonely soul who s only purpose so far has been combat despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him he only knows how to kill not to befriend kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over the top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa relena darlian sounds older in english voiced by lisa ann bailey this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version both voices bring out different sides to the same character his japanese voice is haughty authoritative and commands respect keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued sounding more devious and snake like highlighting zechs secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals the members of oz are a mixed bag really treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down to earth performance compared to his larger than life japanese style of speaking however lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds bored most of the time the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds the maganac corp s voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility despite underwhelming acting from the side characters the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over the top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing s script very faithful to the original japanese script keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics war and human nature sadly it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script

__label__1 i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit and his ocean s 11 director steven soderbergh worse we picked this up in a discount bin for 4 99 canadian dollars at that what a grand and pleasant surprise but then i m of the opinion that if william h macy is in it you can t be disappointed this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s ok with more profanity this is an oddball and at times gut splittingly funny film the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast best 5 i ve spent in ages 
__label__0 there are those movies that are bad they are funny then there are those where you scream i want that one and a half hours of my life back thats pretty much what this is dean cain tries to be an actor but fails the sfx are really bad repeated scenes and rocks that look like falling paper and the fake plastic guns that have torches taped on them the split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just terrible this movie cant even be used as one of those simple night entertainers its just that badif i could go negative ratings i would
__label__0 even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn t join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone s 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right 
__label__0 another movie that relies upon the trite worn out cliché of the mad scientist gone madder the movie centers around a surgeon whose life s ambition is to bring the dead back to life i know i know you ve never heard that one before of course as all of these movies go the experiment goes very very wrong and creates a maniacal bloodthirsty creature for this promising setup you d think that it d be at least a bit suspenseful wrong like many movies of this era the idea is nice but the execution and the script is mediocre not the worst horror movie i ve seen no abominator the evilmaker 2 still takes the cake but not one of the gems either 
__label__1 i drove from sacramento to san francisco and back to see this movie premiere and really glad i did as a big movie fan and a life long northern californian i was surprised how many oscar winning films have been made in the bay area as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la george lucas comments about persistence community and having a vision really resonated with me hey if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf so can other artists would recommend this film
__label__0 i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with drug induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate s drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough i ll grant you but still acceptable then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books so this seven foot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped up dragons is added to the mix of mayhem the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nose diving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i don t know where i would have preferred to live in summary this movie is terrifying if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy

between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell it s like the premise of schumacher s the number 23 play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess di s death however there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoo s nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours it s like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasions i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldn t have been the illogical far fetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated i e the easily impressionable and the gullible zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done don t laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a blood stained toilet while they were conceiving directing that scene talk about putting words into one s dead mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in anti feminism and other nonsense into his theory zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof common sense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the end goal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsd tripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001 s the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently that s another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable ground breaking physical set up in dogville made me snicker however zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious like all social scientists an oxymoron he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it s what we already all know but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listener i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie suit slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kid s park near you http rateyourmusic com

__label__1  panic in the streets was a decent thriller but i felt a bit disappointed by it the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating but the film never really explores or develops it its well made and entertaining but its not as interesting as it should have been the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down none of the central characters are really compelling or believable fortunately the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting the direction by elia kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace there are some standout sequences particularly the memorable chase climax when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later the man could mostly do no wrong the acting is also very good richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well the standouts in the cast are the two villains zero mostel known primarily for his comic roles is effectively slimy as one of cinema s ultimate toady characters jack palance is unsurprisingly a chilling villain panic in the streets is disappointing but still worth watching 7 10 
__label__1  no spoilers just plot details i can t understand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of smallville watch subterranean now there s a sack of crap tom welling gives a good performance i don t say that very often and michael rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic the martian manhunter who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace 
__label__0 this italian film from the 70 s is not even in the class with dog soldiers the howling or even that awful american werewolf in paris but it is fun to watch i m talking about watching the lead actress a stunning blonde run amok in her birthday suit we re talking about graphic complete nudity it s obvious that she is a real blonde humma humma humma the story is a hoot the sfx are childish and the acting for the most part stinks the only redeeming value of this movie is all and there is a lot the nudity sex scenes tame by hbo standards but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night ok here s the spoiler there is no werewolf except in the opening scene of the heroine s ancestor the girl just imagines that she s a werewolf in other words a clinical lycanthrope

__label__1 eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand up concert film i have ever seen most stand up acts usually have lulls at some point but not this one folks for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side splittingly funny from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead on impression of mr t the laughs are non stop sadly this was done in 1983 and eddie hasn t done anything nearly as funny it s unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all eddie if you re out there please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious believe me your fans will love you for it and i think you know that 
__label__0 i m sure this was one of those woah attractions in 1982 when epcot opened but now it s just silly the film s message is cliché the circle vision is disorienting and that awful song at the end is grating and i really wish they d install seats after so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes and when you hear there s a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous you get entertained while sitting down right wrong you re standing there for 18 minutes leaning against a short little railing disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film not fun skip it in fact skip canada altogether unless you re eating there move directly to the united kingdom 
__label__1 this is very dated but that s part of the charm with this 1933 movie you can say the same for most pre code films they re just different and usually in an interesting way it was the short running time the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young s character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy but intriguing film you d be hard pressed to find a nicer girl than trinna played by the 20 year old young who was already into making her 50th movie she started acting as a small child that and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days the camera although in soft focus throughout much of the film zoomed in on loretta s face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life tracy s bill slowly transformed into a loving man thanks to trinna spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting although they have small roles supporting actors walter connolly marjorie rambeau arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75 minute film i was particularly fascinated with connolly s role as the minister father figure of the camp the story is a little far fetched but hey that s the movies this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a hooverville type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale 
__label__0 dear god i kept waiting for this movie to get started then i waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither i just sat there dumbfounded that 1 it could possibly be this bad and 2 that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity i had faith that drew couldn t possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy did i ever lose my faith don t bother with this one drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived i can t believe a script this bad ever got funded it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it still didn t go anyplace its just pitiful where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn t the worst baffles me because believe me if it got any worse i d have slit my wrists before finishing it 
__label__0 if i could i would give zero stars for this one but unfortunately i have to give one there is no single scene i could laugh about but the game didn t make me laugh either so if you re some ill retarded folk go to your local cinema watch this movie and give it 10 stars like some people here already did but for me in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor good taste goes over the edge this was the third time i wasted my time to see a boll movie and it was definitely my last 0 10 i m ashamed of being from the same country as uwe boll please please keep him from making more movies 
__label__1 the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln but fonda wearing a fake nose is uncanny as lincoln with the voice delivery walk and other mannerisms exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been ford in the first of three consecutive films he made with fonda is at the top of his form perfectly evoking early 19th century america the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done the supporting cast includes many of ford s regulars this was alice brady s last film as she died months after its release 
__label__1 does anyone know where i can see or download the what i like about you season 4 episodes in the internet because i would die to see them and here in germany there won t be shown on tv please help me i wanna see the season 4 episodes badly i already have seen episode 4 and episode 18 on youtube but i couldn t find more episodes of season 4 is there maybe a website where i can see the episodes because i ve read some comments in forums from germany and there were people which had already seen the season 4 episodes even though they haven t been shown at tv in germany i am happy about every information i can get thanks kate
__label__1 i was blown away by the re imagined battlestar galactica a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion a hardened sci fi fan i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs and this was good stuff as such when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica which wouldn t work at all bsg s story of a mournful ragged band of survivors trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo miracles was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors caprica feels different where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization caprica portrays that civilization in it s cold and decadent heyday the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality in true bsg form caprica has in it s first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom racism the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul the casting for caprica is also excellent each character is unique and deep from the obsessive and distant scientist turned entrepreneur to his troubled and willful daughter each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles music which was used so powerfully in bsg also plays a significant role in caprica battlestar s powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it s themes very well caprica uses a more orchestral sound which gives the show it s own feeling quite distinct from either of it s predecessors the new caprica is definitely it s own show pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs i look forward to the full series 
__label__1 a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end 
__label__0 i watched this show and i simply didn t find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because it s average compared to them 
__label__1 this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history what makes the story of james j corbett especially interesting is that mr corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day in that respect james j corbett was truly innovated but getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent alexis smith was beautiful indeed she looked like nicole kidman and although it s a period piece the story withstands the test of time it has not gone stale ward bond s portrayal of john l sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well staged and highly effective that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must 
__label__1 if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head the representation of hobbits dwarves etc have had the disney treatment the dark riders are excellent and as i had always imagined from the books cinematically this is an excellent film mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year i only wish he bakshi had been given the money to complete his epic it s worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings 
__label__0 we purchased this series on dvd because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here i gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting directing and writing are brilliant in fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series if one watches it with discernment one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the fox faux news network to avoid giving away any spoilers i will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances a brief look at the plots found here on imdb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide infomercials and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world we watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using attorney general gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us the series also manages to demean male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people all in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing no doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that america lost its way in the early part of the this century as a student of history myself i would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by goebbels for hitler and some of the propaganda produced by hollywood for the american audience during wwii so if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wingers at faux network who produced this travesty 
__label__0  the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew pre screening not that i was involved i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon i m just qualified to comment but that was my limit like other comments here how did this get through any kind of qa an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot tara fitzgerald s casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history as i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldn t sit through it again either 
__label__1 what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren t sure you would see the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun the second part i season 2 3 which are more stale they come and go in what you want what happens with many series is that they don t end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain this one also somewhat did the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series usually but it doesn t this ending is perfect for the series it fits perfect actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in val s life actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end but later on it changed they chose to take vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top see it many times the series is actually very cool just don t expect the second part to be that good it isn t but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when i have seen the whole series i will be back 
__label__0 about 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should ve been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up very rare we d sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next gross out or offensive remark s after about 35 minutes we both got up and left everything we d read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasn t a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool it s the only other movie i ve ever walked out on and i have no regrets i m sick of trying to go see comedies in america 
__label__0 for this review a list of good points and bad points i ll start with the bad bad points the casting choices especially burt reynolds as boss hogg the acting of said badly chosen cast the storyline the idea of setting the film in the modern day the direction the editing the soundtrack and above all the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn t that great to start with despite it s popularity good points jessica simpson in a red bikini that s it one might make an analogy here in the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as enos and asks the question enos where s boss hogg and roscoe in his clouded judgment tells her where they are she might just as well have asked enos is this a good movie the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes even though in his right mind he would have said no not really as good as she looked in the bikini she could have been stark naked and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making stay out of hazzard 
__label__0 this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school i do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciation i do recommend this film to the average or below average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has 
__label__0 this is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director honda with more evidently elaborate sets though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them witness the giant bats and rodents on display it also utilizes a surprising number of american actors joseph cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill at ease and frail but then his character is supposed to be 204 years old an innocuous richard jaeckel is the photographer hero while as chief villains we get cesar romero and patricia medina both essentially campy as i ve often said i grew up watching english language films dubbed in italian but hearing hollywood actors in japanese is another thing entirely latitude zero feels like a juvenile version of a typical jules verne adventure and is fairly entertaining on that level indeed it s preferable to honda s low brow variations on the monsters on the rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set up in this case the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero he was intended to establish himself in the underwater technologically advanced city devised by cotten to which the world s foremost minds are being recruited we re treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on romero s cave in fact cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits via flames and laser emitted from his glove must surely count as the nadir of his acting career the other elder in the cast romero is more in his element after all he had been the joker in the batman tv series and movie of the 1960s cotten has a scantily clad blonde physician on his team and is assisted by a hulking asian romero on the other hand is flanked by an oriental femme fatale who however ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts the girl s brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condor which is among the phoniest looking creatures you ever saw apparently a 2 disc set of this one from media blasters streets on this very day 
__label__0 i think the biggest disappointment in this film was that right until the end i expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was when you consider the powerful subject the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images it is a shame that little attention was given to acting 
__label__0 this whirling movie looks more like a combination of music clips at mtv than as a real movie there is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself what is going to happen but nothing happens the story around eric cloeck the frustrated writer is the only good thing the other persons seem to have nothing in common then why bring them together in a movie with music you can make watchable the worst movie when i open the tap and there comes water out with the music of bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie the director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie 
__label__1 the world of the dragon hunters is a 3d gravity challenged world planetoids bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen it is a world reminiscent of neverending story when the nothing came to eat the world away funny enough the villain here is the world gobbler as well this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes the heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal they are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who to my chagrin did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death the animation is great the voices and the sounds are top notch too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine they go to stop the world gobbler they reach him almost immediately they defeat him the end no real character development or story twists not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot bottom line it s a cute thing to watch kids would probably enjoy it but that s about it no depth to this world pun intended 
__label__1 i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah it is so interesting where did this guy come from now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes with his film 500 years later it is a african issue but the idea doesn t fit that mold showing the artistic diversity the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to i just love the mild comedy in it and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing it is really a art house gem 
__label__0 i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals it came in and the cover made it look alright hot chick carrying a weapon alright i ll check it out oh man bad move this was so horrible i spent half the movie watching in fast forward to get to the nudity which was minimal i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity cheesy dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters i feel bad putting this movie down because i know it was made on a cheap budget but so was clerks and it became a cult classic and a franchise 2 10 
__label__0 i ve long heard that to get their start in legitimate films many behind the camera types work on porno films the people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long poorly paced staged and written it uses a lot of perfectly good talent diehl dorn eggert badly much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere popping host to the alien creature but it never crosses the line you ll still want to shower afterwards though 
__label__0 standard paint by numbers monster fare filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big creature movies it s like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them which were shuffled and dealt whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script characters are so cliché ridden that you can play a game of guess who ends up as a monster meal after less than ten minutes into the movie and probably get every single one right including the order that they will get devoured many of the characters are so obnoxious that you root for the creature to shut them up some of the main characters include a billy idol clone who surfs with sharks a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls a capt ahab guy with a vendetta and ahab s girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar oh and a big big beast in need of anger management therapy along the way people argue a lot pretty girls run around with wet t shirts couples make out on exotic beaches explosions occur ruins of a shrine appear and greasy faced pirates drop by amusing for the most part but one thing bothered me the callousness by characters when other people were killed after one violent demise they make one liner jokes i could almost hear rim shots overall ok if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at a so bad it s good movie otherwise you may want to skip this one 
__label__1 scream was wes craven s last decent thriller since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the scream sequels perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with red eye rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel then she meets jackson ripner cillian murphy batman beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze what she doesn t know is he already knows her and he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson s demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination you re probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes although this is a good old fashioned thriller that s the beauty of it no special effects no cheap make up just classic suspense you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance it s either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn t reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn t so surprising perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman nevertheless cillian murphy after his true identity is established played the role so solidly you d really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked don t overlook this feature there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven s recent pictures if not for the you do it for all the times you ll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you wes finally gets it right aside from his trademark mastery in suspense red eye is not without its humor as mcadams replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order it was a relief that red eye wasn t a disappointment instead you ll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance murphy look creepier by the minute and craven craft a classic traditional thriller a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven s renaissance had it arrived right after scream 
__label__1 though i m not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty the great tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive the film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package ching siu tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if i m not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere an ethereal treasure highly recommended 
__label__0  nobody knows anybody is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week he also happens to be the best friend of the film s hero the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game with himself and the hero as players and seville as the virtual environment the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman type games looked at this way the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays from the start we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game the hero s job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend s father clues are liberally scattered as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant e g the advert in the bar the detective paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress rather than an investigation after the fact the film borrows heavily on se7en s pattern narrative and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter in this reading the game is on the level of narrative with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case the computer to win and save the day but there is a second game the film itself which subvert the first there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer s intentions but the filmmaker s and his hero s in the first ten minutes there are references to chess a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin if we remember that the chess loving nabokov s 1930s pseudonym was sirin we see another game afoot one where we suspect not the villain but the hero himself in a nabokov novel like pale fire an author figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted e g the image contracting or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero s point of view the opening references to games are all linked to him in the early sequences much is made of the character s sexual and creative impotence so the film could be his attempt to master his life to be a winner in a way he can t for real no sooner has he won the game than his writer s block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film suggesting he is the overall author further that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero like kinbote trapped in his own solecism this jumble of post modern literature borges eco pynchon et al are alluded to also fincher x files run lola run chris marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present bunuellian anti clericism and alex de la iglesia s shock films result in a film that is just that a jumble each clever clever allusive element cancelling out the last dissipating interest the lack of clarity about the game s rules renders it incomprehensible and eventually wearing ironically in a work of such overdetermined artifice the film s main interest lies in its documentary quality as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like sans soleil or london but ultimately you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness 
__label__0 as a physics student i ve become aware of many idiot professors and other so called experts in the field as i continue with my studies i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see knowing nothing of it i m excited hoping that the information will be presented well i ve done real quantum mechanics this wasn t it this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes let s think about that for just a moment our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10 30 such subatomic particles that is a million billion billion billion particles the more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50 probability of cancelling each other out completely as you add more and more particles into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption with no rationality behind it it s just stupid my friend also in physics and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie but they were presented in the most misleading manner i ve ever seen i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie as i have not had any kind of medical training it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in biology but i cannot say at least this film had a redeeming quality the dancing peptides or whatever they actually were scene not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by cg peptides and a fully cg scene filled with dancing peptides the film at that point was trying to tell us how we re addicted to emotions so we re treated to the full song of that smash hit addicted to love this scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through that scene and still take this movie seriously well you are the ones that need to open your eyes 
__label__0 there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of let s say little monsters or scary looking dolls which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie really dr feinstone corbin bernsen has been a successful dentist for several years now but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps and he brings his anger and frustration to his work well give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth and you can probably guess what happens next as i said brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should in particular the ending is a huge let down last note watch for mark ruffalo you can count on me eternal sunshine in this one 5 10 
__label__1 has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other s lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and can t get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including you ve got mail the recent update of shop they re not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch s rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of 
__label__1 this is a decent little flick made in michigan about a guy that is haunted by his past with his abusive stepfather gunnar hansen and has grown up not so well adjusted in fact he s absolutely bonkers but tries not to be too obvious he s got an entourage too his own little demon angel that follow him around the demon never says a word but really doesn t have to and he s max schreck creepy let s just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better like freeing people that he decides need it mostly beautiful young women this is a decent portrayal of madness and you re kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what s going on but overall i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest it s a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks 
__label__1 mardi gras made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions americans seemed sad hurt and a little remorseful but didn t really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn t believe it this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own m pitts
__label__1 as usual sean connery does a great job lawrence fishburn is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner 
__label__1 this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like buchholz and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at times yes but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars 
__label__0 i suppose it was for temple matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse spoilers it is much similar to the original melody ariel s new daughter is threatened by ursula s sister morgana morgana escapes but keeps her promise to take melody away from them did ursula have a sister and she is not that great a villain as ursula was this is where there is similarity medoly is kept from the sea until morgana is captured but she doesn t know a thing about it because it all happened when she was a baby a wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out she goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with sebastian who is not as funny or fun as in the original she finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds morgana here is a similarity morgana tricks melody making her happy by turning here into a mermaid meanwhile eric melody and king triton look for her to stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from triton so melody does because she does not know king triton is her father she makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful the penguins who live with them in an icy ocean hate them because they are cowards so they try to prove they are heroes and fail that does not suit the little mermaid and the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear bleeding you know why because the first had a great story this one is not and is not magical it is just an example of how bad many sequels are melody finds them and they help to take her to atlantica to prove themselves when they take the trident ariel finds melody with morgana melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to morgana then she shows her true colours once she grabs it poor ariel and melody are in her custody the penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight morgana s shark friend sorry i did not mention him earlier they finally prove themselves eric king triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before morgana by the power of the trident melody takes it throws it to triton and he ices morgana literally then ariel apologises to melody and thinks it is all her fault it was not ariel did the right thing to protect melody but they never say so triton offers melody to live in sea or land she in fact has a better idea she uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer folk can be together then everyone sings an awful song the end whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original i do not dislike this because i am a teenager i liked it when i was very very little then as i grew older i began to see what is bad about this film young young kids will enjoy it but it is likely that when they are in primary school they will forget about it normally i would think i over judged a film and it was better than i remember when i watched it again but not this one it is even worse story is no exception if you thought by reading this that the story is good read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points well you know the story now i am sorry for spoiling it for you but i had to point out some bad parts of it one of the worst things is the animation colour is awful the original had beautiful colour watching this almost made me want to go blind even the illustrations and landscape design were not good the original had beautiful magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well making it a joy to watch the music is unbearable compared to the first the music here is crap songs are not that well composed and tara strong i think that is her name who did melody can not sing she at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song so much for having melody as a name and the music is not at all beautiful or moving little mermaid 1 won an oscar for it and it truly deserved it this one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist i did not like the voices several people who played characters from the first did the same ones in this jodi benson is a great singer but now that she is older no offence to her her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore and i am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this if i was chosen for this film just by reading the script i can tell it would be a bad film the characters are different now ariel is more wiser now but annoying they overdid her character making her too mature in sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason she was sixteen in the first there is little chance she changes that is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life screenwriters should think of that they should think of the character well i suppose that is it for me i hope you find my comment useful because i am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view 
__label__0 how cynical are the writers to pander so i may be an american citizen but i don t need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film i m astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in u 571 which changes british submariners to american ones but you still walk away feeling a little slimy really the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes how sad unnecessary i d just like to say to the writers it s obvious to many of us that you can t capture real people with real problems under real pressure and that you ve taken some very well tested shortcuts lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar coated tripe 
__label__0 another cult strikes again this isn t a spoiler because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly long pseudo scientific infomercial ramtha s school of enlightenment when any religion philosophy needs to hide behind an oz like screen of deceit i walk away thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a friend to have wasted precious resources on this new age lobotomizer would have been tragic i can only hope that they truly believe they can walk on water enough to take that guidance to it s logical conclusion in other words walk drown or shut up as a movie it deserves a strong 1 on it s entertainment value especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history the photographer s roommate eeeeeek if you must see this film borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it :)
__label__0 first off there s absolutely no flirting going on in this film with anthony or anyone else these people don t flirt they just do it your first test of endurance is to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion this wouldn t be so bad hell i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is repellent so you make it through the torture and mayhem then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different not better just different a road picture without heart there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos broadly written and broadly played by broads like judy tenuta and mink stole and a few hookers and drag queens too they all deserve better the photography is purposely disorienting so if you get motion sickness or really any kind of sickness this flick is not for you come to think of it i m not sure just who this flick is for except maybe gay and bi sexual s m fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot indy films about themselves 
__label__1 i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could ve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years 
__label__1 ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn t let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isn t really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummy one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother s secret is pretty frightening okay the acting in the film isn t all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr flocker you ve done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one 
__label__1 i saw this film on true movies which automatically made me sceptical but actually it was good why not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it s depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy it s not dawson s creek they re not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge they re kids and they act like kids would they re blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don t think so dermot mulroney gives when not trying to be cool a very believable performance and i loved him for it patricia arquette is whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers the combination of the two isn t exactly lavender on your pillow the plot was very predictable and but so what i believed them his stress and inability to cope her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together i think the characters acted by anyone else would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren t it reflects the surreality of the situation they re in that he s sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby i felt angry at her for that i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her i felt it all in the end i loved it and would recommend it watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session career performance 
__label__0 the most positive thing i can say for this dull witted local comedy production is that it s inoffensive in fact it s so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality it s not witty it s not entertaining it s not insightful and it s not charming it s just a staid laughless progression of four losers who must change their ways and their attitudes towards women to be allowed to attend their best friend s wedding with acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society a plot line so tired it d make a forty third season of allo allo look fresh and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables sione s wedding nonetheless scored ten yes 10 nominations in the nz film awards recently fortunately somebody saw sense and it didn t win any 
__label__1 a must see by all if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one easily one of the best animation cartoons released in a long time it took the the movies antz to a whole new level do not mistake the two as being the same movie although in principle the movies plot is similiar just go and enjoy 
__label__1 higher and higher was one of rodgers hart s lesser broadway musicals it only had a run of 84 performances on broadway in 1940 yet it yielded one of their bigger hits it never entered my mind nevertheless except for one minor song so disgustingly rich the entire broadway score was scrapped when rko bought the film rights instead a whole new score by jimmy mchugh and harold adamson was written mostly to accommodate one francis albert sinatra who was making his feature film debut sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films takes a leaf from the page of his singing rival bing crosby when bing did his feature film debut in the big broadcast he played bing crosby frank sinatra took on the role of frank sinatra and i can t think of anyone who could have done a better job the chairman of the board is billed third here behind stars jack haley and michele morgan he s the butler and she s the scullery maid to leon errol in fact errol is a millionaire who hasn t paid his help for seven months mainly because he s about to go belly up into chapter 11 or so he informs the staff errol s a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing they pool their resources and get michele morgan to impersonate errol s daughter who s over in switzerland with her mother the idea being to snag a rich bankroll in the hopes rescuing the family fortune only michele starts looking at another it s a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals but rko invested this film with a good cast of players barbara hale and elizabeth risdon play another débutante and her mother who suspect something s not right victor borge is a fortune seeking no account dooley wilson paul hartman grace hartman marcy mcguire mel torme and mary wickes play others of the errol household staff not a bad bunch at all sinatra sang three good ballads all of them had some kind of commercial success the music stopped a lovely way to spend an evening and i couldn t sleep a wink last night the last one was nominated for an oscar for best song but lost to alice faye s you ll never know 1943 was the year of the musician s union strike against the recording industry to get their material out frank sinatra recorded the songs from higher and higher with an acapella chorus for columbia bing crosby recorded songs from his film dixie in the same manner for decca both of them were denounced by the president of the union james c petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again the strike wasn t settle completely until 1944 although decca broke ranks earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than columbia rca victor and the others the strike provided some anxious moments for sinatra he had just left the tommy dorsey orchestra when the strike was called it closed off a needed venue for his artistry when he wasn t sure whether leaving dorsey would prove to be a right career move fortunately higher and higher was received well a legend was launched 
__label__0 whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke i mean this was the stupidest movie i think i have ever seen a killer snowman terrorizes a small town give me a break love it when he takes off driving the cop car more like a comedy than a horror movie if you want a laugh rent this if you truly want a horror movie stay the hell away from this one 
__label__1 when an actor has to play the role of an actor fictional or factual the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role in a double life ronald coleman surpassed himself as anthony john the tortured double personality he put into that character all his talent and sincerity the facial expressions mannerisms gait and stance spoke eloquently of what anthony john was going through while playing othello on stage coleman also did extremely well as a shakespearean actor in those short scenes as othello that were part of this gem of a movie closups of coleman s face as othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching add to that his character s off stage desperation and only someone with coleman s depth of acting perception can achieve it was like watching spenser tracy as dr jekyll and mr hyde except this double role was much more profound and poignant shelly winters looked so sweet vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie it is believed that ronald coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the oscar for best actor in 1947 i would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored 
__label__1 this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england filmed on location in bolton it stars james mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home or so it seems cleverly the film based on the play portrays the complexities of family life the supporting cast is terrific as well with many familiar faces lending support 
__label__1 paris je t aime 2006 is a film made up of 18 segments you can do the math 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story the movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short amount of time the premise works almost all of the segments are powerful complete and satisfying each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near great actors there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it s hard to pick one or two favorites probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment place des victoires gena rowlands as an aging beauty in quartier latin catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment loin du 16ème and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris 14ème arrondissement segment special mention must be given to gulliver hecq probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station segment tuileries this is an outstanding movie my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed however paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen in any case don t miss it 
__label__0 pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion philosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong examples quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seems to affect the event solid particles can pass through barriers all of this so far is accurate but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this is complete poppycock instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief also you d have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against it this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self hate there may be some truth to that but quantum physics has nothing to do with it plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays instead of wasting your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour long episodes quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation

__label__0 the deceptive cover title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this movie it started out really well and pulled me in i really liked it between 1 3 and 3 4 s of it the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense my first thought was this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story i ended up re watching parts of the movie thinking i had missed something by the time i reached the last 1 5 of the movie it was all boring annoying religion thumping dialog that made no sense said nothing and was annoying to listen to i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end don t waste your time with this flick beware of dvds labeled whitlow films and level path productions and i m a practicing catholic

__label__0 in the third entry of the phantasm series mike and reggie continue chasing the tall man assisted by a trigger happy 9 year old a black g i jane and the spirit of mike s deceased brother he died in the original phantasm number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on reggie s incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand up comedian the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed which fits a story like this better also the settings aren t as macabre here plus the constant presence of the tall man agnus schrim isn t as obvious there still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time by the way beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off screen the entire phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of don coscarelli who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far the fifth being in production the first one is a semi cult classic the second is a horror feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped a michael baldwin returns as mike even though james legros portrayed his character a lot better in phantasm ii 
__label__1 i was deeply moved by this movie in many respects first of all i just want to say that clara lago was the most precious little thing such a pretty little girl her acting was superb as well true to life and very human though i don t like the part where she had to smoke i hope it was only a fake prop either way she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving i found myself immersed in the story and her character it s quite interesting how i came to discover this movie actually i was walking in blockbuster and i just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as i was walking by luckily i glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in i thought to myself awe look at her so i picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as a little gem i read the plot on the back and then thought that well maybe i d look it up on imdb first and then come back and rent it at a later time i m glad i didn t because i certainly would have been missing out after searching for a movie with my friend i knew that i would end up regretting not renting this film so i went back to the spot in which i originally found it and snapped it up it had been on my dresser for a week since school started for me this week and i really hadn t any time to watch it but tonight was the perfect opportunity i popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end i was so captivated and must say some parts nearly moved me to tears i would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film juan jose ballesta he was remarkable also the actor who played carol s father who s name is unfortunately not listed on the site his voice was just so loving and gentle that i could really sense his love for carol even though his appearance is not prominent i really felt his character s presence this is truly a wonderful movie if you are a person who is moved by light but emotional films then this is definitely one for you 
__label__0 for some reason various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first james gregory lee kenyon enters a cave finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of tyranus when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead demonicus back to life this shot on digital full moon release is stupid senseless has terrible acting and sound and the los angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy however it s pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance whether bug eyed running around in cheap looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection kenyon s ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed oh well at least he s not boring like most of the rest of the cast 
__label__0 richard tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything he doesn t like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents might happen to him so one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining in there the whole story takes place he experiences all kinds of staff and in the end he is not scared any more but the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like macaulay culkin could not make the story better than it is 
__label__0 i won t describe the story as that has been done elsewhere we are great clive owen fans and when our netflix recommended the movie we were intrigued no wonder we had never heard of this movie because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992 hence the poor production values grainy image jerky camera work and poor sound but you don t really mind the mechanics because the story itself will put you to sleep it s an interesting human story but not at all compelling and there is hardly any ending you don t really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile 
__label__0 this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it s great to see j beals but she s only in the movie for a few minutes m parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who can t get work doesn t feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straight to video movies i saw back in the 90s and not even a good one in those standards

__label__1 i stumbled across this act i by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this was nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at first my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such i don t think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused 
__label__1 it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it s actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused pauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she s kind of odd looking she s not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she s prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling adele haenel is older more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she s not what she seems or is she i couldn t quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after her there s not so much ambiguity in louse blachere s character she s on the team too but she s dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance the movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literally i don t think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it s suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it s complex and partly because i m not sure i got it all let me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she s also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and self indulgent narcissist you know but then the soi disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she s still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she d like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that wasn t so bad was it and then walks back into the club that s a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i don t know i ve slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i ve only skipped her for considerations of space should you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot 
__label__0 this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped it didn t end it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy s apartment wow i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with 
__label__1 actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling dark and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic paxton himself who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but demons and that they have been selected by god to destroy these demons this is all told in flashback by one of the sons now grown up matthew mcconaughey to skeptical fbi agent powers boothe hard to automatically forget this film better than most serial killer features it s a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks paxton commendably barely shows any blood at all until near the end well acted by all especially the two child actors jeremy sumpter of the recent peter pan and matt o leary of spy kids 2 and domestic disturbance the only reason i deducted any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach in any event it s an atypical thriller with a decent script 8 10
__label__0 i just watched the convent for the second time i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile for the record i m not even a huge fan of night of the demons but there were some things i really dug about it the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much apart from the main girl likeable performance from joanna canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore towards the end when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast all in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just can t make up for the things i hated those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasn t a good time 
__label__0 this movie is flawed on many fronts like many before it it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history the production is poor overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares this to me was the greatest flaw i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude as a native texan i grew up with the mythology i later learned more about the history i can accept a decent production from either perspective although i prefer more historical accuracy but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it even john wayne s or fess parker s versions had more life than this stolid mess while being only slightly less accurate very disappointing avoid it 
__label__1 it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary at times there is almost a desperation as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside as did happen to some rin tin tin however was pertfectly natural in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences some were sure to stand out john barrymore s soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving by and large only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence however this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for film buffs especially interested in the silent to sound transition
__label__1 i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it i would recommend it to other people it comes on lifetime movie network quite a lot and i am thinking since it s close to halloween they might play it more so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it i believe that alicia silverstone played her part very well i really like her as an actress and person she seems so nice and down to earth kevin dillon he s performance was so so for me i am not trying to knock him or anything but i believe that his brother matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better kevin just seems too sweet for me but i think he did okay 
__label__0 the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china the movie is based on the novel by pearl s buck the story is great but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles walter connolly is laughable as the farmer s father he has such a heavy american accent as do most of the lead actors that i could not bear listening to him speak it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african americans 
__label__0 i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well i found it strange and completely pointless so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it wow what a difference the original one was way better i d like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement it s existence did have a purpose it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don t want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you d like to know what it should look like feel free to watch the 70s version a little dated but a lot better 
__label__0 you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre settings go it s a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i haven t been in this flat for two years and we re still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day i ve never heard of you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company dead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven t been delivered for one reason or another so logically she gets a job at the d l o and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its knees nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that ain t difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they ll never find while other characters are peripheral at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider australia s draconian immigration policy i e if you don t speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypes despite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyone s taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes it s nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there ain t any major laughs there s no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional but it s the story that counts here and while it s not earth shattering in its magnificence it s a pleasant enough way of passing the time it s the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn t really miss it if it wasn t there 
__label__1  the garden of allah was one of the first feature length 3 strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disney s 5 year exclusivity deal was 1935 s becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for it s garish color costumes the garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat 
__label__1 for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good movie it s in a class of its own yet it has an international potential the movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of ghost movie don t be afraid be thrilled 
__label__0 having read many of the comments here i m surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called mirror image starring vera miles rod serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending but in a feature film there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense sadly substance and sense are two things missing from the broken yes it has some moments but they are not enough to justify your time some further observations although this is clearly a contemporary story not one character in the movie has a cellphone and even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going there is never any reference to an insurance company to the person who was driving the other car or to the police who would have been required to do a report my advice skip this bore and watch the original instead 
__label__0 i didn t enjoy this movie at all for one i just found it crude and vulgar for no reason i also felt it s misogynistic against women also the movie really doesn t appear to be about anything and i didn t find any of the characters likable really the there doesn t seem to be any point to it all maybe i m missing something but for me this movie is pretty much a waste of time when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable like using my face as a pin cushion james garner is in this thing as are c thomas howell and shirley jones and james cromwell all are wasted here and i m sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers jennilee harrison from the later years of three s company is also in the movie and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role but other than that she can t rise above the mediocre script for me tank is a 3 10
__label__1 it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest if any without his presence despite a not outstanding direction in fact there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly a seemingly low budget a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance even paul scofield acting in a man for all seasons actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crime je suis maurice morand prètre catholique i am maurice morand a catholic priest is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christ s blood gérard the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself has to drink it if he doesn t want to leave it in the cabaret he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine in next scene the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable do you carry away men too asks morand who hates himself for what he has just done that would be too much work is the smart answer the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time i think that le défroqué is a very strange film but has to be seen by all viewers if the are good catholiques it is mandatory because it is a very rare jewell in film history 
__label__0 hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i ve ever seen i m never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don t really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can t remember anyway 
__label__1 this movie starts out brisk has some slow moments in the middle but generally moves along well has a few very good moments then peters out at the end of act 3 i was able to get to see this in la premieres 2 times with 2 different endings jason lee is a star but he is not tomorrows leading man he is humorous and holds his own but he is better served as a supporting actor julia stiles does ok in a comedy role new for her but she doesn t steal this movie the way a star of her caliber should for an actress who has so much potential 10 things save the last dance o it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so average and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie like daniel day lewis did in gangs selma blair is a good young actress as well and does an ok job i didn t expect an academy award performance from her and she didn t deliver one but her performance was adequate chris koch delivers another film that is above average perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else i did like this movie but it is not a movie where you walk away and say that was great this story has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here the rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie and larry miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role he could be the best surprise of the film if you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have an enjoyable evening i can still recommend this film but unless they have changed the ending again leave during the church scene or you will surely be disappointed 
__label__0 yes he is no not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies pintilie is the naked emperor so to speak it s big time for someone to state the truth this impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old man s body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of niki ardelean he used to embarrass poor coca bloss by telling her oh coca how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all 
__label__1  the luzhin defence is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker s craft shines through it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia natalia s rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film i felt that i was put through luzhin s torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one 
__label__1 when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of the lost boys 1987 to my surprise to die for is a really good movie it s a little bit corny at times but still there are enough stylish set pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it s surprisingly gory at times highly recommended 
__label__0 i just couldn t stop laughing this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you don t need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same lame the dinosaurs are the same rubber oh my i could see the stick that holds t rex head for a moment the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2 t rex is also the same but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten action is fast sometimes too fast actually i talk about fast editing they edited it so fast so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs but oopps to late they are rubber well only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel what can i say don t rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining 
__label__1  baby face is a precode melodrama starring a very young barbara stanwyck an almost unrecognizable george brent and theresa harris it s about a girl who goes to the city to make good or should i say make time stanwyck s father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy depressed filthy erie pennsylvania after her father dies one older father type who knows what she s been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there and not the easy ones and to take the high road in life note that i saw the censored version and not the uncut this part of the film was redone for the censors she and chico harris go to new york where lily nickname baby face decides the low road s a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster in the movie s most famous scene the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as lily sleeps her way to the top she finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job trouble follows and she s soon involved in a huge scandal stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets and she s great at playing the innocent victim in one scene she sits staring at a king s ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it s decorated with diamonds at the top then she asks chico for another case and that s filled with more jewelry plus securities all in a day s work theresa harris was an interesting talent she could be played down or glamorous and was a talented singer and dancer as well here she sings or hums the movie s theme st louis woman throughout she worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of stanwyck s her best work being in the precode era as a bizarre byproduct of the code blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore though they re 70 years old seem more modern even though these films didn t have to have moral endings baby face learns her lessons how like life it is after all there were several endings of this film all with the same message the one i saw had an added scene but apparently there were two other endings that didn t pass the censors there wasn t a code but there were always censors at any rate it s a neat surprise baby face is an important film in movie history a must see 
__label__0  problem child is one of the goofiest movies ever made it s not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but it s not the best either it s about a devilish 7 year old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple john ritter amy yasbeck who foolishly adopts him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don t buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film it s asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really don t know why but i can t recommend this film i know i m being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that it s better than the sequel which was just awful out of four 
__label__1 the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children and was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn t like either but in all it was a good movie 
__label__1 after enjoying this show for years i use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren i am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that i have found recorded on dvd florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night michael the baby son is a freedom walker and jj is a clown i know many afro americans disliked this show but i know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was my heart was sad when i learned that ester rolle had passed tyler perry is now the leading writer actor of today and i support his work but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of rolle in one of his plays no one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance the show started getting less interesting when daddy james died it picked up a bit when florida remarried but slumped when she took an absence from the show in all the show was great and again i am pleased to own copies of part of my past i do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of good times and i must say they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors i think children of today will enjoy this show and i have no problem sitting and watching with children congrats to the writer crew and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that i can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes ok so i watch the shows over and over lately i have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series but not dislike them i think florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made not that the children did not need supervision but it was done in a way that makes florida s mothering different the scenes where florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now when james was alive the show made a big thing out of james wanting his own fix it shop but never lived to see his family out of the projects but florida marries someone who owns a fix it shop a bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on good times showing that he accomplished all he strove for lastly as i watch the shows i see the series going in to overtime and being renamed jj to be truthful after james left everything mostly centered around jj not a bad thing just a noticeable thing i would not trade my dvd s for any amount of money but time maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while 
__label__1 i don t understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad unless i m just off my rocker i found it sick brilliant twisted and psychologically sophisticated you won t get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by stone and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it s over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48 and that michael douglas isn t in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out give it a shot you might be glad you did 
__label__0 the movie was to be shown here in bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater it failed miserably apparently the story writer just don t hold water something was definitely missing in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment the movie just lack any substance the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time such as the meaning of sacrifice nationalism etc it is called the central theme the movie fails to answer why would i watch it anyway at least some strange legendary flying elephants psychic king or the eccentric king such as the king and i would have been lovely something would have added greatly to the movies appeal i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie once you got the appeal then the story is the next thing we concentrate on in marketing terms we call it must see upon hearing the title of the movie people would say oh i must see it now where s the appeal in kingmaker why not just redo the title and call it how not to be a king and make a black comedy of the old siamese days to the style of dr strangelove that would have been much more interesting narrative like experiences of the foibles of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny most movies today have that must see appeal such as spiderman men x these titles speak for themselves if they don t have familiar characters some other movies such as the island had an appeal itself when the advertising asks do you still believe there is an island or for the movie retitled how not to be a king might ask the question so do you still want to be a king parhat
__label__0 like many others have commented before me here i have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst i ve seen there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because i hate spoilers i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra to spend on cgi i ve seen worse of those all in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have any knowledge about computers and or technology at all there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and i found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through in addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old wargames and i think it s a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only the actors performances aren t half bad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with still they should never have signed on to this movie not really a career move but i guess we all have bills to pay to those of you who gave this movie top score you have to be on the studio s payroll or something that s my only explanation to all who haven t seen this one by all means watch it and make up your own mind but lower your expectations to the floor and then some 
__label__0 first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90 of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this 1 hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward 2 death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it 3 cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions 4 cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him 5 seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he won t die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem 6 seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on 7 a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it 8 seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so don t mind 9 boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3 this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a child this movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera work effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments 
__label__1 this will be somewhat short first don t listen to the critics as it is not as bad as most say it is sniper uses a classic movie formula which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie while sniper does not reflect the 100 truth about how our country s military snipers work it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper and yes the movie has many flaws but what movie doesn t there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine s bar scene the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope and yes the sniper motto is one shot one kill judge sniper for yourself 
__label__0 i should have figured that any movie with the poltergeist lady in it isn t going to be good it actually starts out okay but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you re watching is a movie inside of a movie there s people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie one girl in the audience is so annoying that i would have turned around and strangled her a bit strange but far from good 
__label__0 a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father ray milland syrupy sugary and most of all sappy story about a battle of the classes when rich kid ryan o neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout catholic father but no one in the film is more annoying than o neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as harvard s champion yuppie followed 8 years later by oliver s story 
__label__0 herculis puaro is in general a well established hero we know well from books and movies this movie or this story don t work and i felt its not agatha s mistake the cast isn t good the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45 woman in the iraqi desert the victim is not likable 
__label__0 this movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century pre wwii india where the british and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true indians are good surely such clichéd depictions of the british are rather passé now apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative the story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in all in all rather uninspiring oh and linus roache just cannot do tragedy going cross eyed with emotional pain just doesn t work for me 
__label__1 when john singleton is on he s on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as boyz n the hood but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot there s very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial eg where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why doesn t professor phibbs have an office a professor of his stature should have one and while we re at it for an engineering student hick or not remy s a pretty dumb character i d think that he d have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence he talks and acts like a total buffoon but that aside the film was very sharp a good array of characters and points of view and singleton doesn t take sides in the story many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides much of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well also the malik deja scenes were really well shot as well the dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness we really didn t need the us flag with unlearn typed onto it give some credit we re not morons and to top it off although most of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well sometimes it gets way too cheezy like deja s death which is fine until she screams out why which simply ruined the entire effect and scene but the acting in general was top of the line fabulous performances by omar epps perhaps the best i ve ever seen kirsty swanson who knew buffy could act michael rapaport surprised the hell out of me after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one role actor and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstanding downside jennifer connelly was flat though it s not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and one dimensional generic to the highest degree and tyra banks who had the role was nothing short of horrid she whined and whined and whined yet another in the long line of models turned actresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule finally the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a glove each scene has a twin song although the tori amos songs started to really annoy me by the end not her best work liz phair rage against the machine ice cube how can one go wrong all in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film 8 10 
__label__0 ben arthur could have been a 10 sam mraovich wrote directed stared and produced this movie sam should have given his idea to a good writer director and left the acting to somebody who could act this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production there was nobody to tell him sam this is bad really bad jamie brett gabel s acting was the only good point but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors to work with this movie is so bad i think sam mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie twice the acting and direction was so bad this movie was turned into a comedy you just had to laugh and in the wrong places a second good point this would make a great date movie after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date 
__label__1 this anime was underrated and still is hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it one of the better movies released the animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view it s a story to entertain not to question still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all 
__label__0 i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing final fantasy the abyss etc framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless moreover there is nothing to watch the fx es look like there were taken from a second hand store you generally saw all of them in other movies but it is definitely a good lullaby :)
__label__0 this film s premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot in summary the oil business is in cahoots with the government or gummint if you prefer the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons of insert word willing to toe any line that comes their way the only people that get done over are the good ones like mr clooney bob oh and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three that really fits to the profiles of the well heeled 9 11 perpetrators in syriana this facile tissue of political half truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that 1 the director good joke should never be let near a camera again 2 people like clooney and hurt might know how to act but they sure don t know how to pick a script 3 if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state go and see claude chabrol s l ivresse du pouvoir which is insightful funny and brilliantly acted empty doom laden sententious piffle spun out to evening ruining length 
__label__0 here we go with other slasher movie good looking people and acting from everyone was really good few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids 20 years after they are still friends they go to huge house have fun drugs and sex no nudity for least half a hour of the movie again they start making pranks phone call all over again and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend movie deaths scene really weird really odd times too nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7 10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointlessthe twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 4 10
__label__1 jörg buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify they are artistically made with also often deeper meaning to its themes this movie is a perfect example of his work it s also really hard to label this movie it s not really a movie with a story to it in a sense of having a beginning middle and end in it it also doesn t have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings on 7 different days all different stories are being told with lots of class though some of them are of course more interesting and realistic than the others they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story the movie doesn t feel disjointed at all all different stories have a different feel to it and buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words also typical for his style but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch again the production values all aren t too high and this might be something that might scare off some people it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark disturbing and depressing themes a buttgereit movie that i enjoyed watching 7 10
__label__0 this isn t a movie it is a collection of unrelated ill conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini dv camera in fact i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor the one with the greasy hair dead pan stare ipod and nervous tic probably shot it herself in a creative phase if you made it further than the ten minutes i did don t bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above this is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made william one shot beaudine cringe the unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity what s next six directors shooting social intercourse at the wal mart snack counter

__label__0 the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood even john ford never made that many with so much quality the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are ford s my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them or at least two the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase chase being responsible for the brilliant red river chase wrote far country bend of the river and probably some others but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine but then very few films western or otherwise are each of the five films of mann have huge gaps or is it six lets see bend far man of the west furies winchester 73 and yep six naked spur each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene with fairly glaring lapses yet so does red river which is still the single greatest western ever made so perfection isn t everything but the far country has huge huge holes it s mawkish and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns the rest is pretty pedestrian with the usual exception of mann s camera mann s camera is a one man course in cinematography it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film it is almost never in the wrong place never the far country has one amazing moment and as usual it comes from stewart nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man he is absolutely amazing look at him in bend far winchester and man from laramie in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau in far he is shot off a raft with such violence it looks so convincing that you wince and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man well you find yourself looking for the burn marks what an actor not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room also as well as anybody ever did it but that was mann s territory look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west as painful as any fight scene ever recorded cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight in short nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann what a great great director see every western he ever made they are his real monuments even if all are scetchy but so what when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody including ford and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone period thanks anthony 
__label__0 whenever i make up a list of the absolute worst movies i ve ever seen this movie is always on it it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever it took an act of will to sit through the whole thing and i would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again what s wrong with it let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater i went to a midnight show on a saturday night i the only ones in the theater were myself and a bunch of loud boisterous rather unruly teenagers sitting somewhere behind me they were obviously out having a good time on a saturday night and had come to this comedy for some laughs before the movie starts during the previews they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time it was borderline annoying had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie i might ve said something but i was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun so i let it go and they did settle down once the movie started why am i telling you all this because you can judge this alleged comedy by the effect it had not just on myself but on this rowdy bunch during the entire run of the film not one person in the theater laughed not once not myself not the boisterous kids absolute silence aside from the soundtrack and when the film was over and the lights came on we all all of us slowly filed out of the theater in slow somber absolute silence it could ve been a funeral this was the effect that this comedy produced not laughter not enjoyment but absolute depression it was a depressing depressing movie and not the tiniest bit funny preachy self indulgent depressing but not funny i consider mel brooks blazing saddles to be on the short list for funniest movie ever it still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the least funny movie ever in short if you re feeling too happy give this movie a whirl otherwise don t say i didn t warn you 
__label__1 i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and can t suspend reality and or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives get a grip people ecgtb is a very entertaining movie if you take movies seriously this is not for you if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way this is not for you but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert or the what the hell am i watching of moulin rouge or the gross out comedy of the sweetest thing then let yourself escape to cowgirls it has some really funny parts hilarious actually it also has some really good music kudos to kd lang also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman need i say more 
__label__1 despite the occasionally stilted acting and seen it all before story this is a fairly compelling movie it has suspense the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy some of the visual effects are superb and best of all no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film as too many wannabe horror films have in them nowhonestly this isn t the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character developmenti was glad i watched it
__label__1 for a long time i haven t seen so beautiful animated feature having healthy respect for pixar i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by em can not be compared to this animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here the graphics is amazing the background surroundings are mind blowing almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly sometimes i felt tingles down my spine so much i loved what i ve seen the plot is absolutely romantic as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be the characters are lovable especially hector the blue rabbit he owns pawns rocks and rules the other char s are very nice also the humor is top notch generally it seemed that creators didn t invest much effort into this i mean it looked like it didn t take em too much in difference from people of pixar dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new and i m very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great they ve made a magnificent touching movie a candy for eye and heart the only minus is stupid beginning and that s why it s 9of10 not 10 10
__label__0 cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80 s thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs and lethal weapon this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in nam but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft although he s huge lou has the brain of a child one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them but payback s a mother they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing that is until these two thugs come into the picture one of them s a real nice guy who have a plan in mind the film s a waste of time maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked alas it doesn t and the audience is left holding the bag oh well it s too bad because you have all the elements for a great b movie better luck next time i guess not recommended xxx
__label__1 george cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic the distinctive ronald coleman is at his best in this piece of noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles the acclaimed anthony john colman has driven his wife brita signe hasso away with his highly fueled temper and erratic behavior but the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences things begin to change as john is becoming bored with his career he reluctantly agrees to play othello he gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man he begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress shelley winters but has no memory of the dastardly deed colman seems faultless in this role winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life also in the cast edmond o brien ray collins joe sawyer and whit bissell 
__label__1 i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated i understand why some of you dislike this movie its pace is slow a characteristic of japanese films nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not a problem at all i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen shall we dansu is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies it is very different from hollywood ones e g austin powers or scary movies in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes rather it is light hearted a movie that makes you feel good i love the movie because it makes me feel real the plot is straightforward yet pleasing i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork i felt lost however this film made me think of the bright side of life i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama if he could find himself in his hobby why couldn t i it reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily life it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes on over all this film is encouraging and heart warming as a comedy it does its job perfectly it definitely deserves 10 stars and yes aoki is funny d:D
__label__1 this is what i wrote to some friends earlier holy crap the grudge is honest to god one of the scariest films i ve ever seen i am either getting very soft in my old age or sam raimi and ghost pictures did a kick a job can t wait for boogeyman i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone anyone sitting next to me except the protagonist in grudge i saw the movie by myself i swear there were many many jump scenes that were not expected i felt foolish but my nerves did not care i was on edge the entire movie from the opening credits and the music was fantastically scary i keep thinking of that sound though and i do not like it i actually gasped aloud a few times and cried oh at one scene oh yeah i even half covered my eyes a few times word to the wise though i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic my dh hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho but i don t remember the movie so can t compare i can t say i enjoyed this movie b c i was terrified but it was very very good and scary the ending scene too whoa for being a 32 year old mommy i think i may have nightmares from this movie especially because of that sound please get out of my head in summary this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with jason freddy this is a most of the time spooky movie perfect for halloween two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring 2 ;)
__label__1 i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture i m white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet it s hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a m and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit overall it s a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies 
__label__1 remarkable disturbing film about the true life senseless brutal murder of a small town family along with the aftermath and examination of the lives of the killers dick hickok and perry smith no matter how much time goes by or how dated this film may look it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this this really traces multiple tragedies the tragedy brutality and senselessness of the murder of the clutter family a decent farm family in small town holcomb kansas and the wasted brutal and sad lives of hickok and smith an interesting point is made in the film that neither of these two immature scared petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone but together they created a dangerous murderous collective personality one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them they push each other along a road of proving something to each other that they were man enough to do it to carry it out neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big score an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led these were two grown up children who live in a criminal s world of not backing down from dares who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness in this instance these needs carried right through to the murder of the clutters the film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the clutter family but the point is made these were respected law abiding small town people who didn t deserve this terrifying fate the movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of hickok and smith perry smith whose early life was filled with security and love but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path hickok poor and left pretty much to his own devices not able to see how he fit in using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with an interesting and maybe the first look at capital punishment and what ends we hope to achieve is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit operating under the radar believing they fool everyone they come into contact with to be deterred you must believe it s possible you will be caught is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught who have committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with them this was supposed to be a cinch no witnesses when caught hickok finds he can t charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks smith who believes he deserves such a fate anyway who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done willingly tells the story when he learns that hickok has cowardly caved in hickok blinked first a silly game of chicken between two immature emotionally damaged dangerous men fascinating psychological thriller telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation s history stunning portrayals by robert blake and scott wilson these roles made their careers 
__label__1 i don t understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one can t say their characters are well developed that doesn t make them any less funny the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting 
__label__1 other than susan hayward s wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes and peck is as always impeccable the stirring alfred newman sound score with the stirring twenty third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day the song of ruth and esther and the king it is worth watching and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol david s estranged first wife 
__label__0 sure it takes place in the west but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western instead it is a movie of a woman sheriff make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff she becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down she is only a tad bit upset by this her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman but the villain hires a guy to kill her so this is what happens the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa utterly stupid as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars but i guess because she liked him she wouldn t do it the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb this movie is very boring and not really worth watching it is not one of the better episodes of mst3000 they made i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful corman is a low budget director but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another 
__label__1 i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it s the finest horror film made for 36 000 i ve ever seen sorry steckler the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims brrrrrrr hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head this film entertained from start to finish i couldn t ask for more than that my only complaint is that is was too short 
__label__1 this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change there needs to be less talk and more action it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray 
__label__0 it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasn t a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i can t say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a 10 year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman 4 
__label__0 i ve been working my way through a collection of lugosi films recently and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of lugosi and boris karloff in the black cat i was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in the raven alas it just didn t work for me and by the end of the film i was quite disappointed for the first three quarters of this movie or so i thought the story lacked any real suspense lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad dr vollins some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman irene ware he treats after a car accident but who can t have her partly because she s already engaged and partly because her father samuel s hinds disapproves to deal with that situation he enlists the aid of edmond bateman boris karloff a horribly ugly man who wants vollins to make him look more acceptable aside from lugosi s performance though i found little to hold my interest then suddenly in the last fifteen or twenty minutes the movie shifts around completely suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful but i thought lugosi s performance fell apart largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane and there s a difference he plays the mad role very well controlled and in control but evil insane is a more out of control evil and i didn t think lugosi pulled that off well at one point he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake in the meantime karloff was a huge disappointment he never grabbed me at all as an aside it must have grated on lugosi that in movies in which they co star karloff gets the top billing even though in the raven it s clearly lugosi who is the lead actor this surely gives a hint as to how universal ranked their two great horror stars inexplicably i would add because i ve always thought of lugosi as the better actor of the two in any event there s no real connection here to edgar allen poe s story the raven except that vollins is a poe fanatic who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from poe s stories overall a disappointment 4 10 
__label__0 this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie so if you haven t seen either movie and want to but don t want the spoilers please don t read this review while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions the actors that they had portray ryan phillippe s christian and sarah michelle gellar s kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed neither can pull off the smarmy snooty rich kid attitude that the original actors did it s absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough you ll recognize it there are also inconsistencies in the plot if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese witherspoon s character also the tie in with the photography you could be a model comment at the end was totally lame and didn t add anything at all overall this movie was a waste of time i can t believe they made a cruel intentions 3 
__label__1 this is definatley one of the best stand up shows evre ever eddie is so off the wall that i ve been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks it s a masterpeice you need look no further than this line the word herb you say erb and we say herb cuz ther s a f ing h in it brilliant 
__label__0 im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i m picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul 
__label__1 romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe how to lose friends alienate people the underlying romance in the plot is for the most part displaced by a far more interesting rags to riches tale although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed in several screen shots it does have a sense of getting the nitty gritty out of the way focusing on those key relationships which make office politics and using those almost irrelevant scenes used purely for comic effect yet it works so well especially with pegg in the front seat the film is ultimately very clever playing well on the trans atlantic relationship pegg shares with his co stars and merging the cross between the high and low life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey the different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film both the trading places relationship between pegg and huston and the love hate relationship between pegg and dunst do work so well in a story that is for want of a better word charming even fox whose main asset is of course sex appeal shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that bimbo role all to well its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work from transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy 
__label__1 this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn t try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature i won t talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don t appreciate it one bit this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this 10 10 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible 
__label__0 dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love wanders is probably not the word i should say he fixates on the past girlfriend he recalls to the day when the relationship ended the dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions he fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went i m not a counselor but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him did i mention how creepy dave is he sometimes refers to himself in the third person he doesn t move his arms when he walks either it s just weird too make a long story short dave plots to hunt down mary the old gal friend and kill her err i mean confront her he does so which was really creepy he believes her to be married yet he still flies half way across the country to meet her he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressions i heard another dave mary song 
__label__1 ms patty duke s story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles i saw myself acting out just like her i was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children i saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and i have loved this movie so much anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for that is not the issue here the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame ms duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they don t know the hell they have to live with the movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts it was so real so so real it was like watching myself up there on screen i wish i could thank ms patty duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness bocka
__label__0 not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath and what i get is one bloody scene the eyeball at the tail end of asinine fake slapping and spinning in a desk chair i end up thinking well that s 43 minutes of my life gone forever i wouldn t considers this or flower of flesh and blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch the devil s experiment did not it was at best stupid and at worst well really stupid perhaps my expectation were too high i put the dvd thinking oh man this is gonna be sick after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times i was watching it in fast forward two kinds of people would be interested in this film 1 people who seek out f d up films just to see how f d up it really is or 2 horror completest i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason but even if i fell into the category of the former this film wouldn t float my boat as a matter of fact i could imagine this film increasing one s blood lust as in would you just kill the b tch already so in conclusion the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes if you want carnage that traditional horror doesn t provide get traces of death sure that sucks too but at least you ll get the blood and guts you expect the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they re supposed to no artistic merit that i can comprehend no reason for it s notoriety no nothing just a lame attempt to be shocking 
__label__1 the third and last part of the bourne trilogy duh is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better the director and star damon themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite advanced story wise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i can t reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than you ll notice it funnily enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films if that means anything to you o 
__label__1 mario s first foray into the world of 3 dimensions is incredible miyamoto s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it s charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure platform games 
__label__1 this was another great tom berenger movie but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent 
__label__0  bela lugosi revels in his role as european horticulturalist sic dr lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia the good doctor s aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty what better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows sedating them into a coma like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the dvd sleeve s synopsis that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie the corpse vanishes 1942 wallace fox bela lugosi luana walters elizabeth russell
__label__1 for starters it s a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh check out the two russian bugs a bug s life has a classical disney storyline but that s one of the good things about the movie family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end and it also has a couple of great voice overs by dave foley julia louise dreyfus kevin spacey of course but actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation it s just wonderful all the details great colors every ant looks different beautiful backgrounds and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic all in all a very nice piece of work this is the best animation by disney since aladdin 
__label__1 i would like to comment on the movie april love it s one of my all time favorites because my father nelson malone plays the horse trainer i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ky where we were living at the time to make april love my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home w the script how exciting is that also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes especially the ones shown at the amusement park it s very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w all the sex foul language and violence it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus 
__label__1 in terms of the arts the 1970s were a very turbulent era in literature and the visual arts it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted in music it was a decade that many see as a low point due to corporate rock and disco on television it was a golden age for situation comedies from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m a s h to all in the family but in film it was even a greater period of creativity in all genres that saw the rise of the american auteur directors like robert altman francis ford coppola and martin scorsese from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century these directors wanted to craft literate arts films for the masses of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war yet the studios were trying to keep pace with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s but unlike the films of the 1930s starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield usually co starring the dead end kids that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment there was precedent for this approach for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers and the early 1960s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running george lucas s first film thx 1138 which dealt with consumerism group think and existentialism and logan s run which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual some of the film s references are quite heavyhanded and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation a few jarred strawberries cost 150 and soylent rations its assorted colored foods soylent yellow soylent red and the new soylent green reputedly made from the finest undersea growth in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film s release and the scenes of crowding and bodies live and dead lying all about are still chilling as well as influential a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny the rest of the script by stanley r greenberg however is rather pedestrian and fairly standard for a dystopian flick but fleischer and cinematographer richard h kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds to spice things up the use of soft dimly lit visuals murkily filtered add a stygian feel to the new york of the film almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyer s vampyr the only light in the film comes from artificial sources and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless the end of the film where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers is both chilling and oddly drama less in the end the soylent minions hunt thorn down but he survives long enough to utter the film s catchphrase to chief hatcher yet one does not know if it is enough for hatcher has already been co opted and has a track record of taking the easy way out yet that fact and its ambiguity shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters dilemmas and has a depth many later better made films sci fi or not do not have it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching 
__label__1 many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was rather typical of clara s later silents i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married clara s lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of clara s ability to make the audience laugh 
__label__0 many moons ago when i was seven years old i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie being the wise adults that they are they told me absolutely not it s a bunch of trash of course i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting man little time passed maybe a couple of days i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded twenty five years passed until it re entered the forefront of my thoughts while surfing through channels on digital cable i found this long lost relic of a movie my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents i should have listened to them the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man it makes movies such as def con 4 metalstorm and freddie got fingered look like oscar nominees i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977 how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me don t make the same mistake that i did listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie they were right 
__label__1 this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living some of the scenes are very funny i don t think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in color the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it 
__label__1 of the spate of austen films from the 1990s this is my favorite more even than persuasion which was the one that converted me to austeniana before seeing this emma i had seen two previous versions but in one emma seemed all wrong more like lady teazle and in the other she seemed half wrong like a possible impostor whereas here she seemed just right young and silly and stubborn in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well indeed it is one of the sweetest merriest things i have ever seen rather in the nature of a christmas treat the script is unusually well formed and the adapter s additions like the shaft of light that reveals harriet to emma in church are all in keeping mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected but i enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain spoken practical side of the character in contrast with emma s affectations and his choleric outbursts against frank churchill are quite funny bernard hepton makes mr woodhouse a figure of almost carrollian absurdity samantha morton as emma s protégé is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be and as in the same producers pride and prejudice care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed uniquely in some cases for me this production was and remains a delight 
__label__1 maybe the movie itself isn t one of the best jackie chan s movies but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made there also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film like they could remake that chase scene i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn t fighting althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film 
__label__0 i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought ana lucia and libby s deaths were unnecessary and really depressing then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode gah i can t handle it i liked this show for the first season but it definitely declined in the second season i found jack and locke s little religious feud to be annoying the deaths of rodriguez watros characters was the final straw i give this episode a 4 10 for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend j j abrams i hope his series in the future will improve on this one 
__label__0 i don t care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didn t know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with o j s attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the drama was emotionless i am thankful i didn t have to pay for this unfulfilling experience 
__label__0 welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack where we ll see that s right another movie that makes absolutely no sense seriously this movie had me so confused at the end i thought i was rewatching at dawn they sleep the plot seems simple enough well that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then um explodes i have no idea what happened and that was before the title screen that s really sad when i can t even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town suspicious nah so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking the guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to he gets lost and then finds his way back oh i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca then they leave there s really no point to this scene it s really just padding if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared but sadly that was actually the best part of the movie wait let me rephrase that really sadly that was the best part of the movie because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on imdb to find out what happened but of course no one else knows so i m sol seriously the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments i ve ever seen on film they dressed her up in a dress he gets kidnapped then released he runs back to the house then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends seriously i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie i mean as bad as movies such as war of the robots are at least they make sense this movie doesn t even make the attempt to be coherent the ending was as confusing as the end of at dawn they sleep and the plot was much more boring this movie gets a 1 just for its sheer i have no idea what happened in this movie ness witches mountain gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10 
__label__1 kabei our mother 2008 is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan a real weeper i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix am i glad i did in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film making from the 1940 s and 1950 s that i ve come to love so much such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures the title credits even begin in the same way with the japanese letters characters in red against neutral color burlap material i immediately thought this director loves ozu the same style was used too mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes even a couple of pillow shots as roger ebert calls them the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another the story follows the lives of a japanese family before and during and after world war two the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father a university professor is arrested for anti war sympathies he s never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls but war starts and he s drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell will they ever express their love for one another will he ever return from the war there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress sayuri yoshinaga she s almost a madonna type she s so beautiful big soulful eyes and flawless skin the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is tadanobu asano what a sensitive performance there is no macho in him at all he s gentle and kind i d certainly love to see both of these two in other movies i think i ll check to see what s available for them the two little child actresses are wonderful too the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences with very easy to read english subtitles i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty four eyes 1954 don t miss this film 
__label__1 in september 2003 36 year old jonny kennedy died he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in march that was an uplifting confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man not shying away from the grim reality of eb the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny s charity debra a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy 
__label__0 relative to other columbo movies this can only be rated a 1 awful i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train crash of a film it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next another reviewer suggested that it was falk s only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role in fact i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money it s a wonder they didn t murder him 
__label__0 it s hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesn t go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffled it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment sorry i couldn t pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters personalities it s all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel i m switching this off now henry in some sort of jail with a taliban 
__label__0 after watching this i had lost a little respect for christopher lee this has passed over time this film was utter garbage first they tried to recreate the ending from the first howling with incredibly bad make up then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film from the look of it it was supposed to be dee wallace stone teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves lead by sybil danning who seems to be naked all the time this is not even worth renting unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity try to catch it on cable instead it would be so chopped up it may actually make sense 
__label__1 in 1930 europe received quite a shock when luis bunuel s l age dor was released causing a riot in paris when screened there resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years three years later in 1933 when europe had gotten over the shock it was once again turned on it s ear with ekstase a symphony of sorts to love the film starred a young unknown german actress named hedwig kiesler who would later change her name to hedy lamarr when she moved to america to escape the madness of adolf hitler as eva a young bride who has just married a cold distant loveless husband played by emil jerman only to discover that she has made a major mistake one divorce later eva is footloose fancy free is out one day skinny dipping in a lake when she discovers adam a handsome young engineer played by aribert mog who takes a real fancy to her and she him after a wild night of passion eva s ex husband turns up once again hoping to win eva back only to find he now has a rival i won t spoil what transpires czech director gustav machaty who directed the original screen version of madam x another parable in romantic obsession directs from a screenplay by jacques koerpel frantisek horky machaty from the novel by robert horky the film s velvety cinematography which reminded me of avant garde photographer man ray s photos of the era which goes for some impressionistic use of light shadow a lot is by hans androschin jan stallich the film s brisk editing is by antonin zelenka the films art direction which goes for a lush nearly art deco look is by bohumil hes if i have any quirk about this film it is the music score by giuseppe becce which goes for an over the top melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast certain themes are repeated over over again wearing out it s welcome fast kind of like some of david lean s over use of certain musical themes especially in lawrence of arabia and dr zhivago some years back a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material cobbled together from various european existing prints available restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the vatican condemned it as decadent yeah right like the church never did anything wrong and the hayes office cut it to ribbons when it was finally released in the u s a in 1936 in a hayes office approved cut likewise minimal dialog in german with english subtitles it was meant to be a mainly visual experience not rated but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by hedy lamarr done tastefully mind you some suggestions of sexual content likewise that would scarcely earn it a pg 13 rating nowadays worth a look if you have any interest in early european cinema or avant garde experimental cinema
__label__0 well what can i say what the bleep do we know has achieved the nearly impossible leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as the postman the dungeon master merlin and so fourth it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety and that ladies and gentlemen is impressive indeed for i have seen many a bad movie this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti depressants to survive and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new agy pseudo philosophy basically if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g this movie is for you if you have a sense of humor a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a sizable portion of good weed then this movie is for you as well otherwise stay away take my word for it the first thing that struck me about what the bleep do you know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera complete with pink heart effects computer generated sparkles across the screen and other assorted silliness who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you the movie was permeated with cheesy gci the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over the counter video editing software but never would because it s just way too ridiculous the script was _obviously_ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief but the writers felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information or rather disinformation which is what most of this movie was all about all the way down your throat well given the target audience that may not have been too bad of an idea the main character for example spends half the movie popping pills apparently though it was deemed not convincing enough so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout which refer to her anti anxiety pills specifically just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down the acting well i ve seen better acting in ed wood movies and no this is not an exaggeration heck the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this it really did the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads a strange mix of kooky scientists kooky doctors and self proclaimed mystics go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life reality you see is a probability field of a bunch of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it what happens when more than one observer observes they didn t say but then again who cares listen to enya meditate observe and you shall be god and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking logic etc all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a paradigm shift and go down the rabbit hole furthermore the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities parallel universes and such speaking of rabbit holes the analogy permeates the movie all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes i m not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing but one thing i m certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex actually the movie is _extremely_ anti sex throughout sex is presented as dirty ugly and anti enlightening in any case the talking heads talk the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with i want 2 hours of my life back here s a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me and that which i used to consider real is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics what does it take for one man to have an erection it takes just one thought nothing changes on the outside all the changes are within an yet he has an erection some self proclaimed mystic head of her own school of enlightenment while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you i hate you you re fat you re ugly i have you main character the fat and ugly photographer

__label__0 i rented this horrible movie the worst think i have ever seen i believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job the worse film i have ever seen and i have seen some bad ones nothing scary except i paid 1 50 to rent it and that was 1 49 too much the acting is horrible the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash the slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a b movied look like an oscar candidate all i can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick i would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
__label__0 first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman in this film you will not see a single sailing boat you will not see sailors ghosts or anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldn t have watched it because i really thought it was the film about the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the flying dutchman legend i don t understand why it is maybe based on the resembling legend called the wandering jew or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it is the only battle scene of the film then you see daniel emilfork who was krank in city of lost children for about two seconds and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting unfortunately he is very bad in the film the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi who was one of italia s best actors ever and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film and boy does that film need wiseness every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement yelling torturing others in excrement fornicating in excrement or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another coming from a dutch director you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven s film flesh blood such a great film the thought of flesh blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good unfortunately and unlike flesh blood there is no dramatic progression no fights no good acting and put simply no flesh and blood the photography as the opening sequence unfolds is well done and enticing this too stops very early in the film the music from nicola piovani of la vità e bella fame is repetitive and annoying when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung throughout the first act of the film which lasts nothing less than an hour the film takes place within the same perimeter which is around the farm where the main characters live the characters play with excrement a lot drown in it play in it a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character a young boy who loves to play in excrement to become older and play in excrement some more the bird man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish conquistadors speak french nothing makes sense everything is confused and takes hours to happen then there is a second act called the ship in which we see what might have been a ship a long time ago but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did i mention the main character while walking a bit further away from the farm just happens to run into it and decides it s really cool so let s live in it the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him but he doesn t really mind because did i mention he s not very bright he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i ve said it s really confused who s who make the dutchman a prisoner along with the retarded hunchback and they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle age peasants fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with feces yet more loitering for the director who seems to have definitely given up on his job or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the end a lot of the mentally challenged new friends that the dutchman made die the woman he had sex with who was his brother s wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son the dutchman and his son talk the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don t have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses 
__label__1 i loved this movie for two reasons 1 jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt and is absolutely adorable 2 the movie helped to inspire a role playing game i thoroughly enjoy mage the awakening i ve shown it at various larp after parties and it s always a big hit d d love and jeff squeeing aside it s not exactly a masterpiece but it s well done and thoroughly enjoyable the plot is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening 
__label__0 i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn t think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasn t the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era if this isn t the least funny set of sketch comedy i ve ever seen it ll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel ridden this waste of 75 minutes is seminal comedy only in the world where seminal really does mean semen scatological humour only in a world where scat is actually feces precursor jokes only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy tits and bums and the odd beaver nice if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven t found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early 70s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint retro hardly sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score and i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief 
__label__0 watching it lives by night makes you wonder just who in the world greenlit this crap a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people and where exactly are they they re in the desert then they re skiing then they re in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle there s no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie i guess you have to start somewhere 
__label__0 ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can t even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie yeah it s worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to 
__label__1 roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion i can t imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself included polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire starting with some lack of self assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there s no tangible supernatural element here while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis be it cheap or more elaborate polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats suspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audience s expectations alternatively fooling and fulfilling them not literally with people s nerves in my book rosemary s baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character what s more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero s mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we the viewers are compelled to judge him reject him while we have been masterfully lured paint n lure into being him 
__label__0 remember the chain smoking channeler exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago this is her lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers the producers have been using phony word of mouth promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe if you believe in channeling reincarnation new age dreck and day old baloney this film is for you if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality look elsewhere the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn t a wacko so you ll give her a bunch of your money if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief then maybe you ll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent

__label__0 this is an extremely boring film if you grew up during the vietnam was as i did then you ve seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation if you re old enough to remember vietnam then you won t find anything new here there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler s excellent film going upriver stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal 
__label__0 i watched this because i thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at guess i was lied to this movie is very boring the movie starts out kip raines giovanni ribisi sitting outside a porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car when they confirm it s the right one kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window shattering it he gets the porsche while his friend gets the keys they start up the car and take off into the night they deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police so the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways then we get a glimpse of memphis raines he is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go kart track then he is confronted by atlee jackson will patton atlee tells memphis that his brother kip is in deep bleep memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in los angeles memphis heads to a junkyard and meets raymond calitri christopher ecclesten this guy threatens to kill kip if memphis doesn t deliver 50 cars within 72 hours there are a few problems with this film 1 story the first 48 in movie hours take place when cage and duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out the last 12 in movie hours are a waste 2 the cars you see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises so where are the other 40 cars why don t we get to see them 3 the chase the chase at the end of the movie was a joke it was not suspenseful at all 4 the dog somewhere in the movie the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well this is impossible the keys were flipped open the keys would have severely damaged the dog s esophagus stomach and large intestines the guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out this won t work the dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys it was stated in jackass after ryan dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum take laxatives lots of diarrhea but no car same case with the dog 5 the cop during the chase when eleanor breaks down for a few minutes nicholas cage tries desperately to start up the car you see a police cruiser behind him who isn t looking at his car at all but right when nicholas cage starts the engine up again the police officer jerks his head to the right sees the car and immediately begins to chase after him it is stupid so right when he heard the engine start and saw the car he knew that was the car he was looking for how does he know it s the right car he only sees the back of it overall the movie is boring there is no action there are very few cars the movie is stupid i have never seen the original but i plan to i give this movie 1 star out of 10 get the fast and furious instead

__label__1 being a transplanted new yorker i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created for example there s a reference to woerner s restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat there is or was a woerner s restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts no surprise because the script was co authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story mushrooms and at the end it s reached inside city hall itself al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself he s the outsider here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he bargained for danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal he s very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do aiello in city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever he s on al pacino s best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part he s a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended 
__label__0 in the small american town of meadowvale dr anthony blake david gale the imdb listing for this character is wrong it s definitely dr blake not dr blakely is the director and founder of the famed psychological research institute and also host s a local t v programme called independent thinkers he uses this t v show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence dr blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it s spinal cord as a tail thingy usually the brain is just sitting in a tank eats mice and the odd bad actor each time it eats someone it gets much bigger meanwhile at the local high school gifted but troublesome teenager jim majelewski tom bresnahan has been caught putting sodium down the toilets jim is sent to dr blake at the pri for help with his attitude and behavioural problems while there dr blake hooks jim up to well something i m not actually sure what this whatever it is is attached to the brain at first jim is able to resist the brain s mind control the brain feels that jim is a threat to itself and it s plans once out of the pri jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend janet cynthia preston as cyndy preston but is handed back to dr blake s assistant verna george buza soon after by officer marks harry booker the brain wants to kill jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it s mind control techniques and with independent thinkers going national the brain doesn t want anything or anyone to stop it s evil plan for world domination jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain before it takes over the world directed by ed hunt who calls himself edward hunt here the brain wasn t as bad as i thought it was going to be don t get me wrong as it certainly isn t great either the script by barry pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by t v storyline it moves along at a fair pace and isn t too boring no explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all it s just there and that s it we have to accept it the story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element there s the t v mind control the brain itself jim being hunted by the police his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding dr blake that isn t explained at all production wise this film looks cheap and probably was cheap the acting isn t great but i ve seen worse and what is david gale doing in this in fact this role is similar to gale s role in re animator 1985 even down to his character s deaths in both films the brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big each stage is just made of rubber it doesn t look particularly good and isn t scary or creepy just cheap there s no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you ll miss it decapitation the nudity is provided by dr blake s assistant vivian christine kossak as christine kossack before she gets eaten the brain had a certain entertainment value for me but i would think most people would dislike it maybe worth a watch if you can see it on t v for free 
__label__1 films such as chocolat beau travail and others have propelled french director claire denis into the top echelon of the world s most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film the intruder l intrus adds to the depth of her portfolio a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by loosely based on jean luc nancy s memoir of a heart transplant the intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective impressionistic terms louis trebor michael subor is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who like the professor in ingmar bergman s wild strawberries attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation though we see only one episode of violence where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder there is a sinister sense about him he might be an intelligence officer a foreign agent or a hit man whatever the case he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences facial close ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the jura mountains near the french swiss border and has an estranged son sidney gregoire collin whom he has long neglected sidney lives nearby with his wife antoinette florence loiret caille and their two children in one telling scene he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic but that does not prevent him from taking his money when the film opens we meet antoinette a swiss border guard who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband when she comes home she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongue in cheek if she has anything to declare other than these three individuals the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in louis imagination louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film s first half hour a pharmacist bambou who prepares his medication a neighbor béatrice dalle who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is and a young russian organ dealer katia golubeva who he tells he wants a young man s heart relentlessly she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind in the last section of the film louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen his heart transplant however appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless intruding into other people s lives with little real empathy the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart staples of the band tindersticks reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim jarmusch s dead man and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular agnes godard godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret a heart beating alone in the snow an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes the baby s expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship a massage in a dark room by a mysterious korean masseuse and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck while the intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature denis forces us to respond out of our own experience to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level if there is any theme a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film your worst enemies are hiding in the shadow in your heart 
__label__0 this is the kind of movie i fear the most arrogant and irresponsible it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all colombian people the performances are godawul from grisales her naked scene is absolutely pitiful to bejarano to fanny mickey who looks right out of a tim burton nightmare to díaz who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one dimensional so cliched and so badly written all he s left to work with is a mustache not to mention the gratuitous ending a gore fest so cheesy that it would make ed wood cringe it fails in all ways cinematography art direction costumes makeup editing and most of all directing jorge alí triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity i can t say anything good about this waste of money except that i hope colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty integrity and responsability from this mean intended fiasco

__label__0 woody allen when at his best has one of the sharpest pens around he can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else however when he s at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness unfortunately melinda and melinda has this stench from opening to closing the set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama to help settle the argument one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing one a comic playwright the other a dramatic playwright whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy the two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave now when i first heard about this film my understanding was that they tell the exact same story the genre comedy or drama only changes by how you look at it now that would have been interesting however the stories only share one main element and a few side elements they are entirely different stories with major plot differences the drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self parody if this was the point then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters the comedy is the story that has moments of success but they are still short and fleeting will farrell is obviously meant to be the stand in for woody but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding woody s stutters and hand ticks woody is the best at being woody when someone else tries they re not playing a character they are modeling a recognizable actor this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story my favorite woody allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than i walked in this one made me wish i could get my money back 
__label__0 in all my years of film going only once have i walked out on a film and that was the dreadful stay tuned fortunately the cinema refunded the ticket and i went to see buffy the vampire slayer instead a minor improvement that film is gone with the wind compared to dick a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of dick was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it let alone laugh with it granted paying to see a movie with a title like dick suggests that it will be filled with inane dick jokes and wind up a huge letdown and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast daniel hedaya bruce mccullough dave foley kristen dunst etc etc and a premise that at least promised something fresh what the film delivered was as portended four woefully predictable dick jokes comic timing suffering from jetlag and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes in short it was the watergate scene from forrest gump stretched nay laid on a rack and mangled over 90 excruciating minutes as soon as you understand that the two main characters airless insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantly will participate in every major watergate event you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses 18 and a half minutes erased from the nixon tapes check the deep throat meetings with woodward and bernstein check john dean getting a change of heart and testifying check the process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real watergate affair with about as much laugh getting to boot and though it posits to be an amusing re deconstruction of the events leading to president nixon s resignation it turns into a paint by the numbers choose your own adventure fill in the blanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less even the film s strong point the aforementioned cast is bewilderingly unproductive here the most disappointing of all is harry shearer as g gordon liddy trapped as he is behind the thick liddy moustache and strait jacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay shearer mumbles a few lines tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows then disappears dave foley one of the comic masterminds from kids in the hall two others bruce mccullough and mark mckinney also appear in this film ah the blessings of nepotism fares badly as well his h r haldeman occasionally lends a much need lightening of the funeral plot but the funniest thing about him is the buzz cut he sports perhaps the films funniest bit of all and then there s daniel hedaya as richard nixon oops i mean dick ha ha how amusingly funny he manages to play a solid nixon avoiding the pitfalls such as overdone make up rubbery nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins while preserving the essence the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness i seem to be forgetting someone oh yes the two stars of the film those over bubbly teenagers can t remember their names perhaps because i have repressed their performances nothing could be farther from funny nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of hyperactive and super hyperactive with an occasional pouty tossed in this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a 70s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the me decade but the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot a kind of extra plot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david letterman or conan o brien this dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this the writers and producers will be far from the cameras gaze possibly cooking up another disaster such as this 
__label__1 wow the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances absolutely incredible if this was visconti s debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film the only other one of his i ve seen at time of writing is death in venice which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than ossessione obsession one of the most beautiful films i ve ever seen but its story was not as involving as ossessione if you click on miscellaneous on this page s links there are stills from the movie on those websites they won t really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from james m cain s the postman always rings twice i can t believe this was made in 43 eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire 1951 the actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don t know anything about it but they re some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema also eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen ossessione was electrifyingly sensual the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema yes i m being superlative but ossessione was just that terrific the reason ossessione didn t cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini and re cut in america american audiences didn t see its full glory till 59 eight years after streetcar i won t say any more about it just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies i ve ever seen and tell you to go out and see it like another reviewer i m going to buy it as soon as i can find it

__label__1 back in my high school days in salina kansas they filmed something called the brave young men of weinberg locally and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks eventually we learned that the film was up the academy and was a bit ummm lower brow than we had been led to believe i had to see it since i was there and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing i was 17 and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post animal house type of comedy right down to the fart jokes watched it many times since and my opinion has mellowed a bit it s dumb but at times it catches a bit of the mad magazine humor at least as well as most mad tv ron liebman might hate it but he is nearly perfect and unforgettable for me my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue where i had parked my car while i was buying some guitar strings too bad my pinto s brief appearance usually seems to get cut for tv haven t seen the new dvd but if my old pinto is visible they ve got a sale 
__label__0 imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about the grudge so in good faith you recommend seeing that movie it is the halloween season after all and it did boffo box office this past weekend so it must be pretty good so you go and you re actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does and you hear yourself audibly saying that can t be the end of the movie but alas it is and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie you think that your date thinks you re a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship actually it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was i see no future for miss gellar in the movies and suggest that she sticks to television in the future actually it won t be long before she is consigned to flea market conventions selling buffy memorabilia and it can t happen soon enough if you ask me horrible horrible horrible the plot didn t make sense continuity was terrible it s apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a grudge ii the return of cat boy

__label__1 normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles but here is a sci fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast and it is gold the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent don t be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids movie it is unsophisticated it isn t there s a lot of hidden treasure a gem 
__label__1 although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren t exactly true to character this was classic h lots the characters outside of mike giardello giancarlo esposito were true to form and the reunion scenes of pembleton andre braugher and bayliss kyle secor were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen homicide the movie aka life everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2 hour episode of the series fontana overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life that s what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a cooperative mood 
__label__0 a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through 96 minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didn t build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didn t really develop the characters the acting was so so most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didn t understand why there was so little or too much of the film i can t decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i don t even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all plot 0 10 characters 1 10 acting 2 10 overall 3 10 i feel like that s too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top 
__label__1 it is first and foremost a chick flick it is a romantic comedy there is a fair balance between the two this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes i don t think any wires were used or if they were they weren t flat out blatant it isn t a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning pretty simple good chemistry between the leads and a fun watch i d like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty i d watch it again with a girl 
__label__1 the music and laurence olivier s sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary this is still a must see for ww ii buffs descendants of the participants of that conflict politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier did you hear that george bush and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories many of the interviews are with second line authorities that is support personnel to the main characters privates captains secretaries eyewitnesses and the like you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary i strongly recommend this over the worn out gaptoothed overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay i paid 120 cdn for five 2 sided dvd discs this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode the menus are easy to follow there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years nay after 60 years since the war finished i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy now my wish has finally come true see this documentary tell your friends buy a copy for your library remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america russia britain canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory what an eye opener

__label__1 as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wife s career as a rising blues singer against the husband s gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while she s away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amanda s plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think

__label__0 i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i ve often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i ve seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines there s tones about society racism and some desire but south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one 
__label__1 this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made amitabh as a country bumpkin arjun singh is hilarious the best thing is the laughter never stops the plot is a same old same old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty with a happy reunion at the end there are villains ranjit and there are brothers sashi kapoor and there are vixens parveen babhi and there are lovers smita patil and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays memorable parts include his walking talking and speaking english the song pad gungaroo re bhand meera nachi thi and everything with his dadoo all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best this is it it will easily give it a 10 10 
__label__0 despite the excellent cast this is an unremarkable film especially from the aviation perspective it may be somewhat better than the egregious von richthofen and brown but not by much blue max remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while darling lilli is fun if not taken seriously it s interesting to speculate what ilm could do with zeppelins and gothas in a new high quality ww i aero film 
__label__0 for the life of me i can t understand the good reviews on this piece of crap it was pointless matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man gina gershon well others have said it but i ll reiterate why the stupid accent totally unnecessary and her acting was just bad i don t know if she was thrown by the accent or what there was no chemistry between these two and the girl modine was in love with suddenly she s shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way where did that come from i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly i couldn t care less about any of these people 
__label__1 too many sources routinely lump this thought provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar nunsploitation which was a mainstay in 70s euro trash cinema overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzi s singular attempt at narrative film making outside of many well received documentaries safely set within a historical context flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century italian nun florinda bolkan s career performance even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulci s devastating don t torture a duckling locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl s budding sensuous nature wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi crazed older sister agatha indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarès from marcel carné s les enfants du paradis and more constructively by a muslim invasion joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be with expected tragic results with its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini who shot michelangelo antonioni s zabriskie point this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman s fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks a lengthy drug induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russell s otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department making something of a mockery out of its semi porn reputation this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation 
__label__1 although it s not as creepy as it s cult classic predecessor zombi 2 i actually like this one better this is because of it s faster pace better settings and cool 80 s soundtrack it s loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci the zombies don t quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good it was made pretty well but it definitely has it s share of cheesiness for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas some are braindead while others say funny lines but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror there s even a flying zombie head how rad is that definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans it d probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well also check out zombi 4 
__label__0 what a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you re left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion unfortunately this is what happened to me by the end of white noise it wasn t michael keaton s fault it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again looking a bit wrinkled perhaps but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance as a man whose wife has recently died he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife not a new idea apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there s nothing being broadcast the idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called evp electronic voice phenomena and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real so i m not going to make any comments about what i think of that or them let me just say that i m all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this but what i can t tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place which is about where i was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll much static indeed there are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled but if a film fails to make itself clear for me i tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker not my own unless i watched it while i was too tired to focus or something well for white noise i was wide awake bright eyed and bushy tailed so guess who s to blame 
__label__0 i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons 1 host steve martin was at his most wittiest i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo and i ll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle s head in my bed 2 surprise winners no one had adrien brody down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine jeers and boos but they won last year s award ceremony wasn t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn t the best in the trilogy fellowship was much better but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics obviously they are i m sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers chris rock wasn t too bad but he s no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the minor oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats there s no such thing as a minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they re as well deserved as best picture or best director all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history as for the awards themselves best supporting actress cate blanchett no great surprise for a competitive category best supporting actor morgan freeman no real complaints since freeman is one of america s greatest living character actors best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn best actress hilary swank major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he d never won one actually i m glad about this because if he didn t deserve it for taxi driver raging bull or goodfellas he didn t deserve it for the aviator best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven t done in the past i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd s sake and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
__label__0 without question the worst film i ve seen for a long while i endured to the end because surely there must be something here but no the plot when not dealing in clichés rambles to the point of non existence dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed characters never develop beyond sketches set pieces are clichéd worse considering its co director the photography is only so so comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside get carter long good friday or kaspar hauser are way way off the mark lives of the saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading in short their craft a ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30 minute short but as it stands it s a 6th form film project realised on a million pound scale rambling and bloated with its own pretensions that it received funding surely only because of rankin s name while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry 
__label__0 pretty bad movie offers nothing new the usual creaks and moans attempt to make up for a muddled but thin story acting is barely above pathetic why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone s guess owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror movie history catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although lili tayor did an above average job the special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous however they can t makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute don t bother 
__label__1 this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war the memories for many soldiers men and women alike returning home can be the beginning of real problems i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii for one of my uncles the war was never over he survived the d day invasion something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan for him the memories not only lingered but tortured him he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins his sons jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war in a different country the result is the same when i saw this at the kc filmfest i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change the idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in iraq and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right the tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all the first casualty of war is innocence 
__label__1 working from a script written in part by nicholas pileggi best known for writing the book wiseguy which he adapted into the movie goodfellas and for writing the book and screenplay casino director harold becker shows how connected circles scratch each other s backs even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like pappas who is regarded as a presidential prospect as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster s probation report his skepticism is agitated how did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence we meet the other players in the plot not the least of which is danny aiello the political boss of brooklyn and tony franciosa the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead how and why these people are affiliated i leave to the movie to divulge though there are never any misgivings that they are the narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character a visionary from louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite but considering i just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge one can t say it doesn t work the shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor s desk a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an off ramp in brooklyn to aid a new banking center and the city s bid for the next democratic convention individual idiosyncrasies are also explored including aiello s emotional bond with the music of rogers and hammerstein much also is made of menschkeit a yiddish expression which pappas explains to his deputy is about the bond of honor between two men about what happens between the two hands in a handshake this connection doesn t mean much to bridget fonda the lawyer for the policeman s association who defends the dead cop s honor and fights for his widow s pension even as incriminating evidence appears little by little the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law there are various scenes of hard impact including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise there is also a compelling and markedly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputy one scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor s decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child in a harlem church his advisers tell him he won t be wanted there but he goes anyway and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole pacino and his character both it gets an impressive reaction from the congregation but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was artificial and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it in the limousine taking them away is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech pacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie the older man unbreakable and aware the younger one anxious to learn but with ideals that don t sway pacino is innate with his down to earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination inspired flair and matter of fact realism cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness the bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul schrader s otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments aiello for instance is a highlight because he evokes his character s joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment 
__label__0 wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls script pacing and direction are uniformly awful action sequences defy belief characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set but also includes multiple sexual references involving shields character as well as graphic deaths the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid and a children s movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities it also wants to be a buddy picture a coming of age picture a ghost movie an indian spiritual movie a travelogue and a western the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist wanda nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon that it manages to do just fine 
__label__1 this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren t familiar with hong kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story wise but overall a good crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior it s a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film 
__label__1 this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack so this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight 
__label__0 what a snore fest of all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update this is by far one of the most pointless this was a totally pointless show in the first place and we really don t need a modern update never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning so many advances have been made socially since the show ran that the entire point of the show if it ever had one has been lost also what is the point of having a character named boss hogg if he s not overweight 
__label__1 dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here cage and boyle are fine but what gives this neo noir its juice is hopper s creepy violent character and jt walsh s sneakiness a drifter gets mistaken for a hit man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his head i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddy and the opening scene in brokeback mountain when the character does the same thing but that s another story dennis hopper is at his best here cocky one step ahead villainous seething and explosively violent jt walsh rip is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately well almost there are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard working deputy in the town of red rock wyoming the first twist hits early on and from there it s a nice neo noir adventure in some sleepy little town satisfying 8 pts 
__label__1 of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say buy this one 
__label__0 really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlito s ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higher its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90 s overall it was approximately 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltio s way fans avoid this fiasco 
__label__0 the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims on the surface it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a not so positive message about rape aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman she needs a man to help her when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying the director satish kaushik went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way the director is famous for being chauvinistic his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strong the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya cleans herself after just being raped she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light what he does not show us is whether ash s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing thus we are left with a confusing message about rape the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedy is simply not funny ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout the music is mediocre except for the title track which is beautifully picturised the only bright point of this film sonali bendre s role is disappointing and pointless overall what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion 
__label__1 bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manouever looking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place some seemingly perilous but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no comment tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy handed potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner ironic given his legendary sense of humor didn t seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st s themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run both compositionally and in terms of acting nuff said my recommendation see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen it order 
__label__1 well now this was certainly a surprise episode in this anthology science fiction series with all of this alien beings extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter this episode would certainly rate as unusual its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story s end or does it kicking off with the silent movie form no recorded dialog but having musical accompaniment in this case it s on the sound track not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician this part of the episode along with the ending section also made liberal use o title cards just like the old time movies while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film veteran comedy film director norman z mcleod was the man in the chair for this half hour installment he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time featuring people like the marx brothers w c fields harold lloyd and danny kaye he was no stranger to to tv as he had done a lot of work on television series it doesn t appear that he and mr keaton had ever worked together before as i cannot find any evidence of this but judging by the outcome of the film they succeeded in doing so with flying colors anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it their short partnership must have been a harmonious one with give and take about how to do things it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton s resurrected from his own silent picture days for example the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo s stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe fatty arbuckle in one of the arbuckle 2 reelers the garage 1919 that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell buster knew that we film our world with a camera rendering it a two dimensional image this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags it is a cardinal rule for his film making the cast was small and once again just chock full of veteran talent stanley adams was rollo and served as mr keaton s straight man jesse white the old maytag repair man ran the fix it shop that fixed the time hjelmet gil lamb serene veteran of rko short comedy series was the 1890 s cop james flavin george e stone harry fleer warren parker and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast without spilling the beans let s just say that yes there is probably a lesson to be learned here if not the one already mentioned the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence then how about be careful in what you ask for because you just may get it 
__label__1 dragon hunters has to be the best looking animated film i ve ever seen it was jaw dropping the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash their weird furry blue dog that pees fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler an impossibly immense dragon but honestly it doesn t even matter what the film is about because it is jaw droppingly gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike and there are forests of floating lily pads the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted storybook look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats some of the plot isn t too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotion evoking dialog makes this film spectacular 
__label__0 two kinds of movies we like are 1 westerns and 2 movies from 30 or 40 years ago we ought to have liked a man called sledge but but this picture is disagreeable annoying and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story good or bad to warm up to there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it sledge has a pretty girl friend but there s no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no account pig the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault this was the rock bottom the only true dud in the bunch 
__label__1  wisecracker the biography of actor william haines offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he co starred with marion davies beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised and no doubt relieved at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice it s still funny and its satirical points still resonate needless to say the technology of movie making has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven t changed all that much show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a first rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst it s well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas by the late 20s for whatever reason marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies including the red mill and the patsy but show people directed by the great king vidor stands as her most enjoyable showcase william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and co star billy boone but this is the leading lady s show all the way marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star her dad colonel pepper is played by actor director dell henderson a veteran of griffith s biograph dramas who coincidentally resembled hearst one of marion s funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray sorrow joy and drops a handkerchief across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture she s hired only to discover that comet makes low brow comedies the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue of course comet is intended as a take off of mack sennett s keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress at some point it may occur to us as it surely did to viewers in 1928 that davies rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b demille and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously giving the high hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone davies performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoire s spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot on impersonation of swanson i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released in any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia peppoire s autograph and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a self mocking cameo appearance evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin in the rain among hollywood s most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused self examination 
__label__1 for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate which basically satanised the english it was interesting to see this film by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in and they were the only nationality present it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts often culminating in the suffering of the innocent this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all 
__label__1 carmen is one of the best films i ve ever seen it s hard to say whose performance is best antonio gades cristina hoyos and laura del sol are superb they dance their souls out it s a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth myth penetrates everyday life dance becomes life and entire life is danced out real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else act out the parts of lovers of old the magic is continuing 
__label__0 warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air 
__label__0 unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague awful why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap the plot premise started out strong enough i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over what a waste this film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else s evening hay what a christian act on my part ;)
__label__1 despite its rather salacious title this is a light teen dramedy unless you re an old coot you ll probably find it likeable it isn t so good on developing characters or situations smoothly though when you view it you get the feeling that you ve been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you ve been sitting down watching the whole time this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters and they are appealing enough jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many i know but i ve always liked the more obscure maddie corman the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown ups is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike 
__label__0 a cast of 1980 s tv movie and tv series guest stars misty rowe pamela hemsley clevon little seymour cassel among several others in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax i really can t see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up 
__label__1 great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced montand gives the concept of the lone wolf police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and most importantly credibility when a typical hollywood cop heroe loses family friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief but when the sixty seconds are over he pulls himself together packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one montand s marc ferrot however is really devastated by his girlfriends murder of course but also by finding out that she had another lover in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene thus all his actions become unescapably logical this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one 
__label__0 i d give this a negative rating if i could i went into this movie not expecting much but i had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson oh how original if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that i have no idea how this movie became so popular seriously the worst thing i ve ever seen i wasn t entertained it wasn t funny i wasn t even bored i wasn t anything it wasn t even so bad it was good it s just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie don t even rent this movie no clue how it s getting such a high rating 
__label__0 as an impressionable 10 year old i liked the love conquers all philosophy of the 70s sitcom bridget loves bernie i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver david birney and an irish catholic school teacher meredith baxter and both sets of parents harold j stone and bibi osterwald as bernie s parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget s parents who have issues with the young couple s interfaith marriage looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences i am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highly rated season created by veteran tv writer bernard slade who a few years after the show s cancellation would write the successful play same time next year bridget loves bernie was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight there was no denying the real life chemistry between birney and baxter but in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects birney in his short lived role in st elsewhere and baxter in family and family ties here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses all in the family and mary tyler moore both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters bridget loves bernie was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered 
__label__1 i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers mona s disappearance helmer s comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldn t be true to lars von trier s vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more self absorbed oblivious self righteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actors i just have to know how it ends 
__label__0 60 minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she s brought to at the beginning of the movie is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate a monster black gloved killer or supernatural evil no she s running from a bunch of bullies for the other 40 minutes that follow various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught which doesn t say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you re going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo we get no sense of sinister mysteries unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but doesn t quite know how to do it we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously f cking wrong here man when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students he does so with quick cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched this is shocking music blares in the background none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here it s all a bit clumsy and aimless with no real sense of urgency or direction a number of people are presented as suspects but there s little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie i like the first kill the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child 
__label__1 my goodness this movie really really shows the talents of actors billy connelly flexes his acting muscle truly an amazing man if you look at him in absolution as a rebel boondock saints as a madman killer and then finally in fido as a zombie his character in fido looks from cute to frightening absolutely fabulous cariie ann moss is no hack either jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character to a heart warming conservative 1950 s housewife rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type casted now onto the storyline no spoilers don t worry this movie would make max brooks author of zombie survival guide world war z happy with joy finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy if you like zombies if you don t like zombies if you are just bored or if you are too busy go see this movie 
__label__0 this movie is more deceiving than ever using a suspenseful looking actor like walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one and the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don t see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there i d rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes leave this one alone please 
__label__1 hidden frontier is a fan made show in the world of star trek the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta quadrant it has some characters from the official star trek shows but most of them are original to the show the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships which gives it opportunities the official shows don t have the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy which characters in shows with only one ship doesn t have the show has good computer animation of spaceships but the acting takes place in front of at green screen and it gives a green glow around the actors not all the actors are equally good but most do fine the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes that is a bit more like in babylon 5 than in most official star trek shows hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using all in all i enjoyed watching it 
__label__0 a yawn inducing snail paced disappointment inside man tells the story of a detective denzel washington who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money when a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief clive owen and his team the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position enter a powerful woman jodie foster with secrets and intents of her own sent to recover an item from the bank owner s safety deposit box that is stored within the bank and you have quite the three way dilemma unfortunately all you get it set up in the film and nothing pays off in the end denzel washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance the only saving grace for the film is its competent co stars jodie foster and clive owen who are much better than the film itself in fact jodie foster delivers the most surprising and high caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless cutthroat villain of sorts clive owen isn t given much to do besides brood and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role it s strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest you have to wonder what director spike lee was thinking while he was creating this film the most perplexing aspect of inside man however is how much unwarranted praise it has received for a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat 
__label__1 i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama which owing to its rather unimpressive 6 6 rating i nearly missed as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7 10 having said that i m so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved and so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form i must say that in many ways though not all viz its themes execution style production etc stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised the notebook i am so surprised that other commentators didn t pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so i can only assume that those who ve written comments have yet to see the notebook they may not share any alzheimer s theme yet i can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed the notebook you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with the stone angel but even if you ve not seen the notebook nor read the book on which this move is based which incidentally i haven t either you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly as long as your favourite genres don t include fast paced action thrillers this is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time s passing how life changes as the years pass and what might have happened in one s life as one gazes back through the years this bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8 10 i can only blame its current lowish rating of 6 6 10 on the 11 of idiots who gave it 1 10 after all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment nonetheless if those 11 who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn t they look for even a few seconds at the movie s premise and promotional lines oh dear whatever the world is coming to don t miss this most underrated gem of a movie but only if you have a brain i e your top ten doesn t include transformers fight club nor the terminator 
__label__1 father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation like the simpsons the show centers around a nuclear family of white lions in this case it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan vincent the italian american flamingo the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner making the most mundane activities entertaining the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues drugs prejudice etc is the source of the program s brilliance the blame for this show s failure lies with nbc they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote rather than the more logical production order several times the show was preempted for an extra half hour of such dreck as the biggest loser as if 60 minutes of that was not enough it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominate luckily the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following 10 10
__label__0 when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member you know you re in for a bad ride i went in with very very low expectations having read some of the other comments and was not let down unlike some other cheap and failed movies however this one doesn t really remain hilariously and unintentionally funny throughout spoilers follow first of all plot it very inconsistent looking past the small mistakes such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours the whole idea it s based on is messed up see the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs after explaining this they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out later the obligatory crazy scientist guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were or we just have a fine little plot hole here the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force half as strong as what was used for hiroshima then two guys later walk in to check everything out and it s almost unscathed there s even another dragon which grew out of who knows what all in all it s very predictable as soon as the guy mentioned cloning i guessed they d clone a dragon that means that our mr smarty pants security guy isn t so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe if you ignore that i knew this film would be about you know dragons putting that aside the second worst thing is the special effects others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning the cg helicopter and the dragon it looks a bit better than a blob but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time to their credit the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie these things are funny to watch however the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not nor are the introduction screens with the vital stats coming to the actors they weren t the greatest but i guess at least they tried they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent bloodrayne for example and you ve got to give them points for that one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in make up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her she looked like she had a bad run in with some white face the script is bad and cheesy you don t really notice the music but it s actually not too bad for the most part the bottom line is don t watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it s bad like i did although the only funny things are the bad cg effects other than that don t waste your time and money 
__label__1 that magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood this is what this movie is all about danni wonderfully played by reese witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she swoons over elvis playing his records and wishfully thinking about love maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn t she dates a local loser whos father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn t good enough she wants to be maureen but doesn t see that she is beautiful herself the moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping they yell and argue and danni leaves but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to danni s to visit old friends danni s parents danni becomes attracted to court and court to danni she is a tomboy and is spunky has attitude and says whats on her mind court is 17 and danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm by the time court kisses her one day danni is smitten danni s father tells her to invite court to the house and he does but things are uncomfortable for court on his sort of date the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court one look between the two and its all over the looks of pain and defeat on danni s face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and individually danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind its in the my top 100 movie list and deservedly so i only wish more movies like this were made because if so my faith in hollywood would be a lot better 
__label__0 oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society it s just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the viewer s throat also a point to would be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity if anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don t seriously please you have better things to do 
__label__1 just caught it at the toronto international film festival this is a good story told in a compelling way the handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes in a documentary style not a blair witch style joel schumacher shows he doesn t need a big budget to produce a gripping film the actors were strong particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film boz 
__label__1 this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties much more fun than than palazzo volpi though just as diseased this movie is a true gem of squalor one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized the characters penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer creating a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect which makes this movie a piece of art 
__label__1 in brave new girl holly comes from a small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at a local competition and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty i loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end it seems a sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production quite a gem in the film archives 
__label__0  the bat people is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100 every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars but it always reliably returns sooner or later and why because unlike the majority of crap in that list the bat people is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz this nearly isn t the worst film ever made since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity but it s still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing the script is incredibly boring with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film other than a sensible screenplay the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make up effects although courtesy of a young stan winston are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film the film s title is inaccurate as people refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person much more than bruce wayne the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine bat cave and a bat mobile a stolen ambulance the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon weekend exploring caves they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal s vicious attack worried that he might be infected with rabies he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital but still this doesn t prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment sure honey the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat guano so basically the bat people is a variation on the good old werewolf theme but obviously not a very interesting one the concept showed a lot of potential but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy there s a nice bit of gore during the climax finally and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at though not to listen to this truly bad and boring film s current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region the list simply wouldn t feel and traditional without the bat people 
__label__1 alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie the only difference is that their trip is somewhere between heaven and hell and ends up being both when they meet the grim reaper they get the chance of an after lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have besides playing roles they have er perfected they also play and revive a couple of extra sales in the process some classic games i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with what it might be like instead of what was without spoiling the movie i can t give you anymore information about this i guess you ll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself 8 out of 10 stars 
__label__0 i have nothing more to say but it was awful i cannot imagine why helen mirren and others were part of this degrading mess and if certain actors don t want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films there was at least one seen that left me curious just my opinion shudder to think what was going on that was cut from the film shudder to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind like i stated before its a degrading mess its not even funny as ebert said of the film caligula with malcolm mcdowell its not a good film not a good story and its not even good porn yeeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
__label__1 i m certainly glad that a film was made about carl brashear s amazing life story coming as it did during the civil rights era brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected brashear as played by cuba gooding jr leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen very similar to jackie robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct as brashear gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father carl lumbly has and lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he s gotten but while harry truman integrated the armed services after world war ii the navy still has its restrictions a black man can only be a cook or an officer s valet the real fighting parts are denied him that s not good enough for gooding who applies to become a navy deep sea diver once at the diving school at bayonne new jersey gooding gets it all thrown at him mostly by the master chief petty officer in charge robert deniro deniro may have some leftover prejudices but he s nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide the best thing about men of honor is the chemistry between deniro and gooding they certainly come from different places but as they get to know each other both turn out to be men of honor other good performances to note are charlize theron as deniro s wife and hal holbrook as the head of the diving school a guy the navy just wish would retire for reasons you ll see men of honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change

__label__0 can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did suck somehow hugh jackman is a rat a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london to an extent throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment i would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happily ever after rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d

__label__0 i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november 2003 and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess that s hollywood 
__label__0  creepshow 2 is little more than a pale imitation of the original designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor which was often predictable and heavy handed still the first time around there were enough thrills to make up for it s periodic lulls resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort the sequel has few worthwhile moments so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent once in a while it delivers but most of the time it just lingers there as in the original all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts a wooden indian comes to life wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves but they are utterly lacking in inspiration there are few surprises and no scares this a textbook example of unmotivated by the numbers filmmaking it doesn t help that this cheap looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style although to be honest there wasn t much to work with in the end the second story comes off best but not by much for the most part the performances are okay at best george kennedy as the ill fated general store owner does an adequate if not particularly inspired job dorothy lamour on the other hand is quite good as the guilt ridden motorist evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable redundant material however most of the characters are pretty thin overall one would think that creepshow 2 would have turned out better george romero who directed the original returned to pen the screenplay based on more of stephen king s stories makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good gory work so why is the film a letdown i guess romero didn t really want to make a second film but was forced to do so for financial reasons it was a decade of horror sequels clones rip offs and whatnot so this one was certainly inevitable i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry picking up his paycheck and running off i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed we can t blame him rating 1 2 out of released by new world pictures
__label__1 the significance of french title of this film la naissance des pieuvres which literally means the birth of the octopuses is rather obscure so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in english speaking countries as water lilies the lilies of the english title are three teenage girls marie anne and floriane who are members of a synchronised swimming team based in the paris suburbs and the film is a coming of age drama about the development of their first sexual feelings one feature of the film perhaps unusual for a film of this type is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves we see nothing of their parents or their teachers and very little of the adult world at all the three girls are very different in appearance and are portrayed as being very different in character the shy retiring marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three anne is something of a plain jane floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys the three together with a handsome male swimmer named francois are involved in what might be described as a love quadrilateral anne has fallen in love with francois but he is smitten with floriane who seems to return his affections although he is by no means her only male admirer indeed not all of floriane s admirers are male because marie has a crush on her attractive friend the film charts the way in which their friendship develops at first it seems that floriane is simply using marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys her parents presumably object to her dating boys but have no objection to her going out with female friends later however we realise that despite floriane s image as the sexy popular girl who is always the centre of male attention she actually reciprocates marie s feelings the film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality anne with her short hair and rather chunky figure looks typically butch yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unambiguously heterosexual whereas the more conventionally feminine marie and the glamorous floriane are lesbian or at least bisexual coming of age films are common enough although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage lesbianism water lilies however deals with its subject matter in a sensitive way with three very good performances from its three leading actresses pauline acquart adele haenel and louise blachere the relationships between the characters especially that between marie and floriane are complex and capable of a number of interpretations is floriane for example simply using marie for sex or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her could floriane s sluttish behaviour with francois and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world or even to hide them from herself this was the first film made by its young director celine sciamma only 27 at the time on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer 7 10
__label__0 zu warriors most definitely should ve been an animated series because as a movie it s like watching an old anime on acid the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god demon wizard thing the plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i m going to say they are blurry and acid trip like yes that s a word i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand who am i kidding i didn t understand it at all it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980 s anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inu yasha at episode 134 drunk yeah that s right you don t know what the hell is going on don t waste your brain trying to figure this out 
__label__1 i remember this movie quite intense for an 11 year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard i d watch it again if it were rebroadcast but the signal is passing pluto as i write this robert culp a highlight of his career i am just glad i didn t live in that neighborhood oh those 70 s what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for pre pubescent suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in lodi nj the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film and then they left the carcass on the stoop rotten kids 
__label__1 i saw this film at amsterdam s international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers the film s title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent equally important was the loving and gay relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave taking were very moving i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian 
__label__1 not on the same level as ring or ring 2 but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror template and put more spookiness and less cheap shocks in their flicks lots of good examples in this one scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling just for a second and more worth checking out if you like the genre 
__label__0 exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be massacred again there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film i was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a euro trash sexy horror flick i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out all the good stuff more than likely i got the pg 13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new planet of the apes movie watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff you ll need it 
__label__0 this is absolutely the worst movie i ve seen all year first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast this was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a self centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers this was worse than watching a car wreck 
__label__1 ernst marischka one of the most respected austrian directors of that time made films full of beautiful scenes delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life nowadays if people should hear about him they associate the name of marischka with sissi trilogy 1955 1956 1957 however he made other excellent films like das dreimaderlhaus 1958 embezzled heaven 1958 and definitely this one madchenjahre einer konigin showing the young years of queen victoria although it deals with a slightly different theme than sissi films i do not see many differences between this movie and sissi they are strikingly similar the movie is almost identical the style the music the photography in fact the crew are almost the same anton profes bruno mondi the cast romy schneider s one of the first main roles it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress it is also a film where romy plays with her mother magda schneider but ernst marischka was not the first director who cast romy to play with her mum romy s debut wenn der weisse flieder wieder bluhn 1953 was her performance with her mother too therefore there were some voices that romy began her austrian career on the bases of her mother s fame indeed there is some truth in it again like in sissi this film shows love very gently victoria meets prince albert in a little inn in dover their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles and now what would it be showed like only sex but is it the only thing love is based on i am grateful to ernst marischka for these movies they had a soul and a message some people may call them kitschy but i will never give up admiring these films they are impressive unfortunately highly underrated 
__label__0 if this is all the watchowski s have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning beautiful is story wise cliched ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans all too eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance doesn t that make the machines the good guys the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans who reject them in favor of all out war which the cleverer machines naturally win if this is the back story then we shouldn t be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate since i do not believe that the watchowski s intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt creating a back story 
__label__1 a great movie lansbury and tomlinson are perfect the songs are wonderful the dances with a particular mention for the portobello ballet are gorgeous as for the animated section the match between animals has become an instant classic the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating i recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video here in italy we have only the 98 minutes version although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes if possible watch also the german videocassette it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it s missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders 
__label__0 although the director tried the filming was made in tynisia and morocco this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen failed the script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies while the duration is very long but the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon who doesn t seem to understand the demands of his role 
__label__0 this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai ming liang for me it oozes laziness from its every frame so i m not going to analyse it thoroughly either but some observations 1 if the premise is drought why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy and watermelon the trivial substitute sex or it is only a matter of lousy film making not giving a damn about being coherent 2 we don t get to know what had happened to the porn actress why she is unconscious or presumably dead it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully bombastically delivered but in retrospect her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick a pretext just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in 3 nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadn t expressed better 40 years ago and without needlessly humiliating his actors 4 the musical numbers recycled from the hole felt like a secondary schooler s idea of artistic counterpointing executed on that very secondary school level of skill if that was the point the point sucked 
__label__1 why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime conan is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better the brutal violence cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen this is not similar to bakshi s usual frenetic style it s quite a departure for bakshi and in my opinion his best work i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves 
__label__0 oh my goodness this was a real big mess that just couldn t help itself jeffrey jon heder is a 29 year old man still living with his mum diane keaton and not planning on going anywhere until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert jeff daniels who she may be getting married to it would have been an ok movie if heder didn t play his jeffrey so annoying from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse in the end we are supposed to like him but there was no reason to as he hadn t changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie keaton doesn t look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007 s because i said so not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton and where supposed to believe that their mother and son the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don t look very interested either apart from a few little smiles this film really doesn t deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort 
__label__1 picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii s past and the people who lived there in that time the time money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live takes a whole new meaning to blood sweat and tears the concept of dating matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net just that is more of snail mail very slow snail mail the singing of the plantation s songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers songs of their demise and future goals the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility 
__label__0 i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism in their lab a run down warehouse in l a they create a t rex a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase of course the t rex a rubber puppet gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off one cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city she is of such superior mental ability that she can t even operate the radio she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost the t rex wreaks havoc throughout the city there are blazing gun battles and buildings cardboard mock ups blowing up but a single police car or the army nor anyone else ever shows up such activity must be commonplace in los angeles we can only hope that a sequel isn t planned 
__label__1 q e d was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for i suspect that in this era of tivo and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982 i am eagerly awaiting its availability on dvd while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild wild west the bearcats and the adventures of brisco county jr all of which i am a huge fan of q e d had a much more intellectual quality to it it did not suffer for that however the dialog was witty and the action was high the show ran in the uk as mastermind and it did have something of the bbc feel to it but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era i was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television i remember my dear mother however calling me to remind me that q e d was on and we would sit on the phone and watch it together wonderful memories truly q e d is a sad loss and if it could be done with the same quality and values today i would love to see it make a return 
__label__1 i saw this film at the toronto international film festival i loved this and not just for the obvious reasons blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of mount everest s sister peaks now this kind of thing is usually a can t miss inspirational moving pretty standard right and even if the film were just that i d still have liked it but it was so much more blind herself german sabriye tenberken established a school for blind children in tibet in a culture that sees blindness as a curse as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives and at best are a burden to their families as part of their education tenberken shares with them the story of american erik weihenmayer the first blind person to reach the summit of mount everest she sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students instead he comes up with a plan he ll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23 000 foot lhakpa ri and provide all the guides and equipment sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts erik s team are mostly american mostly male and mostly sighted as experienced mountaineers they re type a personalities very gung ho and goal oriented sabriye is european female and blind and the students for her are more than a project no matter how well intentioned additionally the students are tibetan and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves as the expedition unfolds they become pawns in between the two adult sides wanting to please both while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment as an additional obstacle other than being blind that is they are speaking english as a second or in most cases a third language and struggle to understand and make themselves understood when it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience and that some are much more coordinated than others it begins to unravel erik s original plan for them all to reach the summit together as both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults at the risk of oversimplifying on one side are those for whom the destination is all and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey i won t tell you how it all turns out except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought provoking stories i ve seen in a long time the film also weaves bits of each climber s story into the narrative and this was sorely needed since once on the climb the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut with all the drama going on around them that wasn t surprising the backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking and i found it very strange that i found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end this was contrary to my expectations and another pleasant surprise in addition to all the human drama to cover director walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen deprived conditions herself lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn t break down as with all great documentaries the filmmaker was just lucky enough or smart enough or prepared enough to be at the right place at the right time and she s captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do what s best for the kids as it does about the kids themselves 
__label__0 ever since i started visiting this site and voting for movies i have never given any movie a rating of 1 even the disturbing dance workout with barbie got a 2 there is a reason for this any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie i have to stop and ask myself the following question is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul sucking beast that is theodore rex and i ve never been able to answer yes i would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said hey let s remake blade runner with barney in the harrison ford role and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film furthermore i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn t gone strait to video this is that rare monster a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults i d ask what were they thinking but in this case it might actually be redundant anyhow all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you re one of the five or six rabid fans of howard the duck or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time or you want to really punish yourself 
__label__0 the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dull spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree there is no emotion in this film the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and boring with some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good 
__label__1 this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses from the time they walk in to the time hardy just falls off the roof this keeps me laughing hysterically i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short i also recommend all of the ghost series if you are looking for laughs see this movie and you will be happy 
__label__0 think of the ending of the grudge 2 with the following a man who repeatedly says the word sunshine a cowboy a love story sarah michelle gellar cutting herself and a creepy mirroroh and underwater sea animals yay not a good movie i seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever the poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to suck people into watching it i can t believe i went save your time and money go watch saw iii a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it im mike and im out
__label__0 this movie started out with some semblance of a plot then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward it was impossible to remain engaged with this film this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio clearly there are morale and motivation problems at disney not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation this movie joins my very short worst movies of all time list 
__label__1 this movie is why i found this website i couldn t find this movie anywhere else i am so glad we found it here we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it one other poster commented that it is was boring though i must say that it is not especially if you are a horse person you will love this movie the horses are awesome well trained and the movie is well done it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library we will be recommending it to our friends the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times 
__label__1 with this movie it s all about style atmosphere and acting true i didn t believe all of the plot developments but it didn t matter the terrific acting the unexpected plot twists and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and carried me along for the ride and i had a great time kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent he s surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles robert downey jr embeth davidtz from schindler s list and fallen tom berenger daryl hannah and robert duvall that i was simply blown away i recently bought a copy of this movie and i never tire of watching it simply one of the best thrillers of the year if you ve ignored this movie and chances are you have then i suggest you check it out 
__label__1 jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain he happens upon down on his luck trickster eric tsang who immediately sees cash potential in the youngster s skills basketball is the chosen avenue for riches and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before it s all a bit shaolin soccer i guess but not so quirky or ridiculous the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set up you ve seen it all before but it s the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it s done well luckily it really is done well here some might say surprisingly with chu yen ping in the director s chair i expect he had good assistants the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect eric tsang compensates with a larger than life character that he s played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional moments since the film revolves around basketball it s good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing the cast show some real skill including chou and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyper real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movie s plot existence there s only one significant fight scene in the movie but it s a doozy in the one against many style jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive he s clearly pretty strong and fast for real and ching siu tung s choreography makes him look like a real martial artist i wish there d been more but at least it s a lengthy fight very much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing 
__label__1 one of the best documentaries released in recent years some points 1 hugo chavez was elected venezuela s president in 1998 his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela 2 in 2002 a coup briefly deposed chavez at the time irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha o briain were in caracas shooting a documentary about chavez for british television their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath and electrifyingly records history unfolding on the spot outside and inside the presidential palace 3 chavez aimed to free venezuela from the free market policies imposed on it by the us though venezuela s oil was already state owned it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace 4 despite being the world s fourth largest oil supplier venezuela remains swamped by poverty its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations 5 the documentary begins by portraying chavez s first years as president before the coup it focuses on his popularity with the poor and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals educational plans distribution of the oil revenue grass root democracy etc 6 chavez was a huge proponent of education and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution encouraging children and adults to study and understand it 7 when chavez came to power he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits this understandably made the oil companies nervous 8 a media war broke out the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the state run tv station they questioned chavez s motives sanity and sexual orientation 9 without media support the coup would not have been successful the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated 10 under the guise of re establishing democracy the opposition silenced the state run tv station dissolved the national electoral board supreme court national assembly and took control of the military 11 moneyed interests backed by the military elite encouraged by the us and cia organised a citizens march on the presidential palace to effect the coup snipers shot at chávez supporters but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted 12 police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters further bloodying the streets 13 chavez held captive refused to resign of course the media government then lied saying he had resigned but chavez s cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv 14 the people rose up pressuring the return of the president they had elected whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace 8 9 10 at a little over an hour long this doc is far too short nevertheless its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of media warfare which rarely gets touched upon makes a great companion piece to the battle of algiers worth one viewing 
__label__0 i watched mask in the 80 s and it s currently showing on fox kids in the uk very late at night i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was it s just plain awful it is no where near in the same league as the transformers he man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it that s if mask doesn t put me to sleep first one of the lesser 80 s cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids 
__label__0 this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that i ve gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3 d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we re given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooper other than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can t ever get back 
__label__0 i feel like i m the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh s performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was deplorable it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank one of the previous reviewers questioned why u s actors were not cast in this film i second that notion it s wonderful when actors actresses wish to expand their horizons but it s another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but he s a such a great director well i really don t want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you d rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man

__label__1 i m one of those people who d crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film from trust and iris to henry fool and my hartley favorite no such thing hal s unique brand of movies are an acquired taste infusing equal parts mystery espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte the comedy isn t in your face necessarily and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition and that s the case with fay grim the sequel to henry fool parker posey stars as fay grim abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henry s only son ned fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen his name is fulbright jeff goldblum man of the year and he wants henry s notebooks there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings apparently there s much more to them secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists who knows but henry agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry and it works but not the way they think fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henry s notebooks and to seek him out she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon james urbaniak out of prison he d helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession spy rings shoot each other to death henry is discovered being held in safety by a jihadist fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her son s life and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in danger hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes and he does so to the extreme here even character names grim fool fulbright fogg have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny the over the top espionage films of ol are given plenty of screen time too as guns blaze in stop motion sequences never striking our heroine even though she s right in the line of fire now that i ve heaped praise on this creation i will say that parker posey s excessive portrayal of fay grim isn t the best part of the film which is a shame considering how much time she s on screen i realize this was probably what mr hartley wanted an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme but it was still painful to watch at times even so fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more though this wasn t my favorite hal hartley film i know i m ready 
__label__1 i liked antz but loved a bug s life the animation that was put into this paid off i will definitely be getting this on dvd by the way disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest i only saw one of the two sets but i can t wat to see the other one 
__label__0 in 2005 george w bush started with his second period as a president of the united states north korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons pope john paul ii died after a long illness and a movie called into the blue appeared the existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year but the film itself was pathetic and maybe the worst one from that year now in 2009 the united states have another president there is another pope new korean nuclear weapons and the film into the blue 2 the reef which is better than the original one but that s the same as saying getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut this sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested the cast of into the blue 2 the reef is composed by tv series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight but who are perfect for showing their bodies chris carmack the o c david anders heroes and alias laura vandervoort smallville marsha tomason lost and audrina patridge the hills bring hollow and boring performances i have liked some previous movies from director stephen herek critters and bill and ted s excellent adventure specially but on this movie he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension emotion or entertainment the characters from this movie are not only badly performed but they are also repulsive honestly i wanted all of them to die the cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for hawaiian hotels into the blue 2 the reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film but that s the same as nothing as i previously said avoid this crappy film at all costs 
__label__0 as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars 
__label__0 daraar got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla by the way don t you think he s a little old for her things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an over protective neat freak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason one of the reasons i really don t like this movie is because i can t stand to see juhi my favorite actress get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening anyway all i m trying to say is if you re thinking about renting daraar you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else 
__label__1 it s cheesy it s creepy it s gross but that s what makes it so much fun it s got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh the film centers around three women newscasters during a time way before cellphones they go to a small town to cover a festival but they can t get a room to stay the night and that s when they meet ernest keller he s creepy in a psycho kind of way and he offers to let them stay at his home but he doesn t tell them the truth about who lives there stephen furst s performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of ernest s family is kind of interesting just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look 
__label__0 i really don t have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack so here goes atrocious i m running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the 10th time it s really really painful but it was next on the list you can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is hobgoblins but it just couldn t get out everything about this movie is 4th rate the story the acting the effects the women the action scenes the ahhhh forget it i can watch a piece of crap like the bloodwaters of dr z aka zaat over and over and over with hardly any ill effects i like it in fact btw it will be on tcm later this month october 2009 but hobgoblins is a whole nother ballgame the worst part of it all may be that it s now about 12 hours after the movie ended i had a good night s sleep some coffee and some dry toast my medications and yet the ersatz new wave dance music that amy red shorts and laraine newman were frolicking to in the living room is still running through my head this torment will last for days good luck won t you 
__label__0 i do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of direction or script as you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone it is absolutely distracting and without substance which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie i do not write many reviews here but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment movies like this erode at movie making as an art form movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them people hone there craft there 5 senses and there business sense overlooking there own inner life however i do not put blame on them it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age qualified by films like this one but by proxy these manufacturers i would dare not call artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen diffusing it to everyone a story of bounty hunters guns guns and more guns heavy handed flaunting of sex for the oh so popular actress did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her over saturated over exaggerated one liners non linear plots all different and yet all the same annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat a story a development of character or just withheld missing information revealed at the end to create the effect of a story as if one took place it altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety it is a caricature of stereotypes and genre where are the films with awareness what about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there what about the depth of a look what about editing with a point about mind and consciousness yes even in action films this can happen sure they have honed a craft but what use is it without soul or wisdom of insight into the human condition can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art or compare this to picasso and others i say put this next to gandhi or the godfather even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings then look me in the face and say it again it is a good crew but they need some help with depth and story i hope they get it because i like the crews previous work better luck next time 
__label__0 sakura killers 1 outta 5 stars maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool if you had never ever seen a good ninja movie cheesy 80s music cheesy dialogue cheesy acting and way beyond cheesy martial arts sequences the coolest scene is at the beginning with an aged chuck connors playing golf on a beach several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and naw i won t spoil it for you if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you ll thank me the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something a bunch of dim bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because only a ninja can fight a ninja or something like that strange these guys don t seem to fight any better after their training than before oh well the movie does move along pretty briskly the fight scenes may not be great but they are plentiful and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles 
__label__0 i am a huge fan of warrior movies some of my favorites are braveheart troy the last samurai and gladiator and after watching mongol which is absolutely awesome and which i strongly recommend i had high expectations from a sergei bodrov movie but it was terrible awful even pathetic is not a strong word in this case the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen but it didn t then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end but even that was a huge disappointment just some random running around waving with the swords there are so many good warrior movies this one is not one of them 
__label__0 it s the early 80s there s a group of suspiciously old looking teens and there s a maniac stalking around yes this is slasherville this movie is called pranks why is it called pranks i haven t the faintest idea unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone s dinner with a baseball bat on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told but there you go the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose to combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark it ends in tears for most of them pranks is a badly made slasher movie the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence this makes the dvd even more pointless because let s face it a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time for slasher film and video nasty completists only 
__label__0 there was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film zoe mclellan but even her looks couldn t stop me from voting it the lowest possible one the plot is bad and irrational what more can i say the movie sucks 
__label__1 after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do 
__label__1 i was pleased to see that she had black hair i ve been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn t spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as well i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the books i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation 
__label__0 there are so many incorrect statements in this so called documentary that i found myself shouting at the television bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims he relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims what s more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sites further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions all of the claims made by mr sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven how do i get that 40 odd minutes of my life back

__label__1 this is a film which had eluded me thus far but now that i ve watched it emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style as usual with the divx format the viewing was far from ideal marred by the occasional video and mostly audio glitches but given that the film is still unavailable on r1 dvd this will have to do for the moment since the film s reputation is quite high within the genre itself i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well known actor in the lead anyway the belated entrance of the film s nominal star franchot tone packs quite a wallop especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first tone was a underrated actor he was rarely given meaty roles and this may well be his best making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous the female lead ella raines who would later feature in brute force 1947 as well as siodmak s own the suspect 1944 and the strange affair of uncle harry 1945 is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss alan baxter innocent of his wife s brutal murder other key supporting parts are essayed by thomas gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator and elisha cook jr the genre s quintessential fall guy as an ill fated ladies man of a percussionist like brute force s jules dassin siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction all tilted angles and terrific set pieces including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly attired raines who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail another great lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender another uncooperative witness around the streets of new york which results in his being mowed down by a car notable too is the trial sequence which is entirely depicted through the audience s reaction so that judge jury witnesses and d a are never actually seen although the judge s voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor samuel s hinds the centerpiece of the film is the scene in which gomez and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved with the inspector s put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone dizzy spells the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment where she discovers evidence of his guilt and he confesses to having had an affair with baxter s wife but killed her when she wouldn t desert her husband for him by the way i hit upon a little goof in the film while the story is clearly set in 1943 i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film in which alan curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater the establishing shot of new york comprising clearly of stock footage features a marquee promoting laurel and hardy s 1938 musical comedy swiss miss incidentally famed mystery writer cornell woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym 
__label__1 moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you re not a michael jackson fan i m a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasn t fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were if you re a fan i personally believe the first 50 minutes are re watchable many times over the dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos it also includes some live concert footage if you re a big fan of michael jackson this is a must if you re not a fan don t like michael jackson steer well clear 9 10
__label__1 this is the best of shelley duvall s high quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick s prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although i m not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve martin s comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the show s flow as is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much 
__label__0 this is without doubt rajnikanth s worst movies ever the first part is held in place with solid comedy from goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical our hero also takes a dig at saints with the same name baba through a corny and utterly lame one liner the first half has rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the himalayas where babaji not the famous saints he took a dig at earlier gives him special powers for no apparent reason other than karma this is really starting to get interesting now isn t it the rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic the usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a param vir er shakti chakra with him the bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd overworked and in the end completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn t go anywhere but despite all the flaws it was fun to kill time with and yell baba related one liners during public events its also fun to watch others curse about this movie ar rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone thats how important he considered it rajni is very popular in japan and he has included two characters one of them is called keiko why not samsung of japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it but the way they are portrayed dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic the japanese may stop watching rajni movies after seeing that this movie was probably promotional material for rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams fun if you turn your brain off though 
__label__0 otherwise it is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and i mean ever my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable women non lesbian don t bathe together nor do they accidentally kiss brothers and sisters don t live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park men don t find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife absolutely ridiculous heather graham is possibly the worst actress in films today she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights and that is because she wasn t acting i cannot stress enough how bad this movie was 
__label__0 scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesn t find much support at home since his mom is a slut after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field strangles the poor kid however something magical happens no the film doesn t suddenly become good lester s spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hell co written co produced directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr duforq although i don t remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it s terrible reputation i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it s terrible the script by itier bill cunningham jason white uses the often told story of one of life s losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick we ve seen it all before we ve seen killer scarecrows before we ve seen faceless teens being killed off one by one before we ve seen one of life s losers get his revenge before we ve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before we ve seen incompetent small town sheriff s make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it s any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a resounding no to be honest the film has terrible character s awful dialogue an inconsistent predictable story it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask s can you dig it the so called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn t that exciting the kills are forgettable you know i m still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corn director itier doesn t do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there s never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also i m not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back flips somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix 1999 or some japanese kung fu flick to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one liners twirl around a bit don t you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring i know he s a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day there s no nudity the gore isn t anything to write home about there s a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in people s heads someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth with a supposed budget of about 250 000 this was apparently shot in 8 days well at least they didn t waste any time on unimportant things like story character development technically this is pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played lester s mum s bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous don t get me started on his accent scarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows 1988 not to be confused with the gene hackman al pacino film scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels scarecrow slayer 2003 scarecrow gone wild 2004 
__label__0 i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldn t believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else i tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it right or wrong it s better than not knowing anything who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that we re going to be subjected to end game 2 
__label__0 well i have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid when i used to watch it on a home projector as a super 8 reel now there isn t much to recommend it other than the inherent camp value of actors being terrified by replicas of human skulls the special effects are pretty silly mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed ghost images but there s something to be said for the sets the large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy especially since it s mostly unfurnished probably due to budgetary reasons it definitely inspires more laughs than screams however just try not to get the giggles when the wife who does more than her share of screaming goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husband s ex 
__label__1 11 oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shoulda woulda coulda category for the judges its an amazing book but true to alice walker s style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out the cinematography was amazing the african scenes live much to be desired the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia somewhere in west africa but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa and most of all why get the people to speak swahili who in west africa speaks swahili i just had to get that out of the way but as a story amazing film making out of this world classic yes i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation 
__label__1 i can admit that the screenplay isn t very good and that it has some slow parts but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun first of all the performances are great michael douglas kim basinger kiefer sutherland and eva longoria michael douglas proves he has still got it and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife kiefer sutherland and eva longoria play the dynamic duo both adding their incredible talent to the pot and second of all this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore its plain and simple if you want to go to the movies and have a lot of fun see the sentinel 
__label__0 the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the 1930 s but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis 
__label__0 is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws orca isn t exactly a jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws s success first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at best the plot is basically a male killer whale orca after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge i couldn t stand to watch this movie again the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentless as for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters aren t the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good the violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer whales don t mate with only one mate as depicted in orca overall this movie was bad poor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i m not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it my rating 3 5 10 but for its concept possibly a 5 10 
__label__0  a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn t care who he has to kill to get it the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life if this sounds ridiculous it is the whole idea that this izod wearing dune buggy driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly his friend may be good with a gun but he s up against a group of trained killers the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob there s also a sub plot about how the friend s father was killed years ago by the mob boss but there s little made of it and it doesn t help the movie any at all the mob boss mister scarface is played by jack palance i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck i ve seen some pretty good italian crime cop flicks recently but mister scarface isn t one of them check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead 
__label__0 okay so i just got back before i start my review let me tell you one thing i wanted to like this movie i know i ve been negative in the past but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film i didn t it s not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this and it s not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor are you kidding me it just wasn t scary one thing i was surprised about there was more blood than i thought there was going to be which isn t saying much the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa s mom at her house she comes in goes upstairs camera pans to her father dead on the couch spooky she goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens finds her brother on his bed apparently dead how could she tell he didn t have a spot of blood on him killer comes in donna hides under bed mom dies she runs outside screaming for help killer behind her i did it for us cut to therapy session this confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back filler dialogue ensues they cut to the chase pretty quick few scenes at the salon they go to the hotel of course the killer is already there for some reason he escaped 3 days ago but the police family weren t informed until he s already there more filler ensues i m not going to go on about what happens in the film because i don t want to spoil it too much if you want to know who dies horror_fan made a post about it already but on the subjects of deaths they weren t that exciting people in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience i ve never had before in a horror movie not even in when a stranger calls during several of them one in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious scared face i ve ever seen the only death involving any blood was lisa s and that was pretty scarce her throat is slashed blood if you can even call it that it was practically black splatters on the curtain thing the only other blood was on claire when we see her body apparently fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death um okay the movie was one of the most clichéd i ve ever seen let s see here obligatory close mirror curtain boom scene check twice actually you could tell they were struggling mandatory backing up into killer check there s also the backing up into lamp scene but you ve all seen that oh you say you want a birds flying away scare well you got it yes they managed to incorporate one of those in here and of course the we have security on all exits but he still escaped scene shall i go on i could for anyone saying the characters weren t stupid are you kidding me oh even though the massive alarm is ringing literally saying please vacate the building and 3 of my friends are missing i m going to go upstairs to get my wrap these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever the only likable character lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie oh i just realized the psycho teacher is here i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her oh shoot the elevator is being to slow guess i ll take the stairs and run off into the construction site ugh by the end of the film they all deserved to die the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna s boyfriend i can t even remember his name is that bad and by that time the audience was completely drained out of this scareless clichéd film there were some positives the acting was decent for the most part and it was well shot but that s about it i d give it a 1 5 and that s being generous just for the laughs and believe me the audience had a few and brittany snow oh and the reaction was bad very bad people were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative expect bad legs for this one 
__label__0 the premise for circle of two is an intriguing one a forbidden love between a sixty year old painter ashleigh richard burton and a fifteen year old girl sarah norton tatum o neill and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society s standards the problem with circle of two however is that it fails to live up to its promise director jules dassin and hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay when i watched this film i expected to learn something new about love and sexuality instead i got boring dialogue a pointless lecture on art outings where sarah seemed to have more fun away from ashleigh and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost this script makes good actors look bad so one can imagine how the film s problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that jules dassin assembled tatum o neill was not in her element i did not believe for a second that her character sarah was in love with ashleigh her performance seemed superficial like a contestant at a beauty pageant it was as though she forced herself to be happy when the script required her to be happy and to be sad when the script asked her to be sad the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all that was probably the closest tatum s sarah norton ever came to being real but tatum was not the only one at fault richard burton s ashleigh lacked the charm the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age let alone a fifteen year old the rest of the cast was also dismal even their arguing was unconvincing because they waited to take turns who does that michael wincott as the jealous ex boyfriend paul was probably the best thing in this film but his role was small to be fair to the actors dassin s direction let everyone down but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script kubrick s lolita did that with james mason and sue lyon konchalovsky s runaway train went beyond the script with jon voight and eric roberts playing convicts the directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them in spite of its own score a combination of antonio vivaldi carl off and bernard hoffer circle of two never succeeds in doing that in conclusion the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one but its execution in circle of two is terrible in many ways it is a shame that a controversial lolita type story which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid did not have receive more intelligent treatment that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written that actors who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real could not be found and that the director jules dassin who did so much better with films like rififi and topkapi did not have to will to put his foot down and say before we do any filming we must rethink the love story and revamp the script the only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made if such a film ever appears this it will be surely spark controversy debate and questions for many years to come 
__label__1 despite its low key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries the r rating in the states can t have helped honestly just because hbc uses the c word this is actually a fine piece of work the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but it s overcome by the playing of the two leads it s easy to win plaudits just because you re playing a physical or mental cripple daniel day lewis geoffrey rush dustin hoffman etc and helena bonham carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely in fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes and what eyes this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film except possibly hamlet and there his playing was diluted by the large cast here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a self loathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn t always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth in short we believe him just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein as the priest in the proposition as the lawyer in the gingerbread man even as andrew in peter s friends this is surely his finest performance yet so why could he not produce the goods much earlier as a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldn t amount to very much but it s been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and i eagerly await more from them though not love s labour s lost 8 out of 10 but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10 
__label__0 this is very much a television version of the tale the film starts out like an episode of xena with little meaningful dialog or character description it does get a bit more substantive after a while but all characters are still cartoonish salma is the exotic beauty richard harris is an evil and sexually repressed frollo fiending to bust a nut up in salma the other characters including quasimodo are quite forgettable its also a sorta liberal version of the story frollo is a suppressor of enlightenment ideals like the abbot in name of the rose and quasimodo is a champion of liberty the shadowy side of the quas character is ignored though he does pour liquid led on people he is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person perhaps the film is intended for children but i doubt it considering frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey a mostly uninteresting and forgettable but not awful and sometimes entertaining rendition of the tale 
__label__0 in all of low budget history this movie has to be one of the worst true ther are some humorous sides to the movie but in general it was just plain awful i just can t understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man this was rather amusing 
__label__1 with a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief the plot is well written and the cast was knockout every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining being a huge john candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment 
__label__1 so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies it s been a while since i ve seen one that really made me jump or fidget nervously definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i don t get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible well if that s what you think then so be it i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared so i have to say that this one is worth watching now you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story i think that if it was shown in chronological order it would have ruined the whole thing i m actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don t have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid 
__label__0 i know john singleton s a smart guy coz he made boyz n the hood so how did he write and direct this it s like the pilot of a bad going away to college for the first time teen soap a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition i guess who would ve guessed the date rape victim would dump sausage for seafood the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo nazis and would be roomed up with a black and a jew just for laughs even laurence fishburne s creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy it s like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot except busta rhymes of course big ups 
__label__1 i agree with jerry it s a very underrated space movie of course how many good low budget ones aren t underrated if i remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip off of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer and like hal they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with hal it led to disaster there is at least one funny moment when the christopher cary character who can t find any food finds the abandoned pet bird there s a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesn t happen after all 
__label__0 some guy gets whacked right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him he s got some bodyguards and they whack the killer but a reporter gets interested she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked she walks in and corners one bodyguard but he doesn t feel like talking i can t figure out why it s not like anyone else is interested she s the only reporter there anyway her editor discourages her from working on this lame story but hey she does anyway she goes to see the killer s sister mom a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital she finds him hungover on his boat but a minute later they re both underwater sucking on a scuba tank cause three guys are trying to whack them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street there s a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse some car chases with wreckage death a fake suicide etc etc lotsa stiffs all kindsa carnage great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard can t figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked what s the motivation of course it might help us to figure out why the reporter s even interested through almost all of this she s the only reporter on the story nobody else in the media cares not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies true the original guy who got whacked wasn t exactly a celebrity his job was a little bit dull he was just the president yeah the one who lives in the white house oh and the bodyguard is a secret service agent is that the spoiler it should be after all there are no tv cameras no other print reporters no bloggers just another one of those police blotter crimes so what s the spoiler lemme think no wait the spoiler is that his wife did it yeah the first lady she was p ed because the president was fooling around and she gets away with it she s really sharp huh but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out why would anyone bother after all only one reporter is even interested i give this move a 1 it was so dumb i just had to keep watching and it only got dumber that s the real spoiler but even though i ve told you you ve got to see it to believe it 
__label__0 i saw the original chorus line on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater michael bennett knew he would have to re imagine chorus for the screen but could never figure out how to do it if the man who came up with the show is stumped that should answer your question there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live with an audience however richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of ghandi and dancing with animals in doctor doolittle ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show horrible songs were added surprise surprise great songs were dropped or given to other characters which didn t make sense michael douglas was mis cast people that couldn t dance tried to act and there was the sexy landers woman who couldn t sing act or dance i guess she had just finished being ghandi s wife the dances by jeffrey hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from flashdance rejects and nothing works i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 see it but don t think that the long running musical event that was a chorus line has any thing at all to do with this film 
__label__0 it s not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoeven s original pants down shocker it always struck me as a glossy well made airport novel of a movie thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist after a decade of anti sex aids induced hysteria a film about a wildly sexual hotbod who thrill kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy so the fact that it s desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort of be overlooked all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable that it resoundingly fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch let s state the obvious for starters sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell what was so photogenic thru verhoeven s lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun for hire michael caton jones who s flat drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot i like sharon stone a lot but if the first film launched her career bi2 could kill it she has no chemistry with stuffed shirt david morrissey their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch his dough faced mamma s boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering orange skin machismo of michael douglas supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché heavy posturing and what of the much touted sexual shenanigans poorly lit fleetingly glimpsed as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed don t watch this film for carnal thrills there are none and what there is is tragic the film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable the last 40 minutes in particular where you come to the realisation that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure as a failed sequel basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2 as a vanity project it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception as a multi million dollar piece of hollywood film making it s a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst 
__label__0 i found darkness to be just too dark it had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go ugh but it was underlit to the point of confusion you don t really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on super 8 film you already have all that nasty grain to deal with as with nathan schiff movies it s just too much director leif jonker seems to want to make an original film but he lacks the know how to do it the camera is never pointed in the right place lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well the actors are all pretty uneven and hammy but despite these negatives the music is good the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances is this a classic like it says is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise no but it is a good first try now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie from what i understand here the only one they have ever finished for a while and try again they may do better 
__label__1 i have to agree with everyone else that has posted i watched it quite a while ago but i ll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn t explain things properly but it didn t ruin any part of the viewing experience i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more i ve always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely i d recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action also even though this was based on a h game it doesn t have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way i have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it 
__label__1 clara bow s beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film hula is not quite up to par with clara s best films but it is still enjoyable she dances she rides her horse and pursues the man that she loves this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming gone with the wind the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time if you like clara i would reccomend hula 
__label__0 i watched this movie for a project on love please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character and then re read the lines he s saying my life cannot go on i accidentally cut off my own hand my brother was close by obviously his fault and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone no closure bad script and doesn t have enough extension of minor characters save yourself unless your up for a good laugh costumes were done appropriately and extras did a fabulous job i m sure it would have been a fun movie to make but keep it more genre specific i can t recommend this movie to anyone i know because it is not an intellectual movie it is not a chick flick it is not a strict romantic and i can t show kids because of the sex and questions to follow all in all just not a good flick 
__label__0 it s like this you put in the dvd and the most professional looking thing you see over the next ninety minutes is the logo of the distribution company and at this point you know you ve just been jerked around people are generally trusting enough to assume that if something has been put on dvd it s going to be of a certain level at least financially if not creatively but sadly this isn t the case distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together dvds of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the well designed dvd cover the weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie pioneer kevin j lindenmuth whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he s responsible for various other low budget werewolf movies rage of the werewolf werewolf tales and so on blood of the werewolf is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with hereditary shapeshifters the first segment blood reunion pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret this instalment is poorly directed poorly directed and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera the second story old blood is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by lindenmuth himself it tells the story of a lesbian couple one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power her wish is granted but she doesn t become the creature that she envisioned this short movie shows that lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie and finally we have manbeast in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas they wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous but all might not be as it seems this one has an interesting concept but it s stretched out to be far too long and if you don t guess what the twist is in the first ten minutes then you probably ain t too bright this pretty much sums up the problem with this whole dvd a few good ideas just aren t enough to justify spending money on something like this after all would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself 
__label__0 it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it but the ending is so abrupt there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends what happens after the concert what happens with her boyfriend does she hook up with grant does she come beck in the next semester and what about angela obviously holly s performance would knock angela down a few pegs but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts there is so much left up in the air and it s very unsatisfying i don t know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed 
__label__0 i hate this movie it was nothing like the book and just thinking about it makes me mad if you watch the movie before reading the book then yeah it s a good movie but king s book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it i mean the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different the ending for example so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze yeah there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr halloran what the heck he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn t important overall it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off 
__label__0 the title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town that s basically the whole plot for this film and while the scenes devoted to the munchies themselves are somewhat fun in a lowbrow kind of way all the rest is just filler and bad filler at that from the hero who is a painful woody allen wannabe to the ultra dumb town cop it s hard to pick the most irritating character in the film there were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and i was thinking ok at least the girlfriend is cute but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons the film is also filled with pop references from ozzy osbourne to linda blair which probably made it already dated by the early 90 s 1 2 
__label__0 this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological i stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them i mean how could the movie really be bad nobody ll admit it it s a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner but the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what i m writing right now i actually plagiarized their faces obviously lois is only aroused by power she won t even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesn t stop jet liners it can t be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that in the old supermans she had some level of connection with him he wasn t priority number 1 obviously but it strengthened her character that she was torn i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kent and now it s official kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg person superman one he loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way he s human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to highschool students he relates to people who feel different he relates the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems he s just doing a job when he s saving people there s something about clark that lois likes she s really internally in love with him but can t admit it and when he comes into the picture as superman it throws a kink in the on the rocks love without superman she would ve fallen in love with clark at least that s what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois literally superman two i just watched it again as a kid i thought i enjoyed the action but now i know it was the story that held me then too watching it over and over again if i saw superman returns as a child i would ve hated it then too i think there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie it s sick superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile meanwhile lex luther s got something fantastic up his sleeve superman three now there s a three way love story between superman and lana and clark only humanity wins and clark s inner nature beats superman s power because when his supermoral nature is gone and he s superhuman who does human things with his superpowers she sees it s not the power of superman that she s in love with it s not superpowerman but supermortalman that she loves and who s really super and when she tells clark she prefers him to superman he is elated he has made a human connection again he wants to be accepted for who he is not just for his ability to bend steel this is the kind of stuff that s missing from superman returns clark super sneezes to help the kid get a strike humanity again plus it s an ineresting use of superpowers he s not just using straight brute strength he crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving it seems there s nothing at stake in superman returns even in superman three we see the damages caused by the nemesis world domination plot we see suffering we see how it effects pryor and others and people in the middle of it there s no damage esp emotional from lex s plot to sink the us we see a glob of crystal thrown into space superman had to get very creative in the first three supermans in order to stop the plot against him he couldn t just access his superpowers in the first one he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save lois life this was thirty years ago in the second one he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more powerful than but combined with lex s genius and the villains immoral tactics superman s overpowering wasn t enough he had to work one against the other and outsmart them in superman iii again his superpowers weren t enough to win he had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw he couldn t use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression and he found that acid earlier when he couldn t simply use his superpowers to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his superbrains he couldn t carry water so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire now in superman returns he simply lunges the island into outerspace like a night temp for ups he doesn t need to figure anything out he just uses his super strength and lex luther s brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasn t grey poupon he was looking at 
__label__0 in the tower of babel installment of the mini series the narrator describes the builders of the tower as the descendants of moses that s like saying george washington lived many centuries before alexander the great or that the light bulb was invented before the wheel or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow need i say more the writers of the greatest heroes of the bible should have at least paid closer attention to the chronologies of biblical people and events

__label__0 this is a review of freddy mercury the untold story theatrical release chicago int film festival 2007 one of the phoniest uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries i have seen if the film i saw in a movie theater was originally released on tv i would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature even as a made for tv documentary the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous pseudo literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed infomercial the only redeeming aspects of this the untold story of freddy mercury or uhm was it the untold story of princess diana are the original concert video and tv footage unabridged freddy mercury and queen testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights such as he was a free spirit really i thought freddy mercury was a company man belittle those freddy testimonials by brian may or montserrat caballe that shed new and affectionate light into mercury s complex life and character and what up with the harry potter like boarding school segments how did the interview with the first girl crush who now works in a travel agency and members of freddy s first school band contribute to what i really want to know about mercury vital milestones of his personal life his sexuality his artistic style and growth queen the band remain unexplored these filmmakers don t ask a single provocative question nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend who doesn t deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a sunday night 
__label__0 this is the worst movie i have ever seen the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer the acting in jill the ripper is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes it doesn t know whether it wants to be an s m flick or a really bad thriller only watch under extreme intoxication or if you re bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction this script should be reworked into a porn it wouldn t take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life a porn even a bad porn wouldn t do the damage to dolf lundgren s career the way that this movie has 
__label__1 wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really it s a stretch to call this a kid s film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel esquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid hero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike s work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti war anti revenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi faceted adventure f n rad and one of miike s best 
__label__1 i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users some are saying it s his worst movie ever what haven t any of you seen cradle 2 the grave my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on duh what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action of course not black mask is awesome wall to wall action throughout nearly it s entire running time it s also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people too get slaughtered most of li s other martial arts films are nursery school when compared to black mask there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever and that made me a happy camper again if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons black mask is probably my favorite of his movies though beware of the horrendous dubbing

__label__0 i remember watching lost missile actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home i was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me i was from time to time the eric cartman of the 1960s sorry guys and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of million degree heat emerged as a plot device even as a second grader i knew that a mere missile just couldn t carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation my inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self punishing crime the film s production values were very good the acting isn t bad apart from the shatnerism of the actor who played governor s aide that someone else here mentioned but the idea of a missile easy baking the surface of the earth by means of the heat of its exhaust no how d the people at mystery science theater 3000 miss the lost missile anyway it s a great classic of unintentional comedy watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend

__label__1 this almost unknown gem was based on a french farce which shows and i mean that as a compliment caroline lee is being courted by a wealthy argentinian roland who asks her father for her hand in marriage but caroline is already married to anthony colman who has just arrived by plane and launches immediately into an audience directed reminiscence about the last time caroline decided she was in love with someone else a dilettante ish sculptor gardiner the film plays out the story of anthony s strategy in uncoupling caroline from her sculptor and how that experience aids him with her argentinian it is perfectly cast ronald colman is at his most sophisticated and charming reginald gardiner is at his most priggish gilbert roland is at his most exotic and anna lee is just deliciously whimsical the film is wonderfully directed by lewis milestone who also produced the whole production feels like a labor of love there are wonderful touches such as colman breaking frame and addressing the camera and exceptional use of a sliding bar cabinet door it is a sin that it hasn t been released on dvd this is the kind of film that can singlehandedly awaken interest in classic film

__label__0 john rivers life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car during the days she has been missing he confronts a man that s been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other side through e v p electronic voice phenomenon naturally he doesn t believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e v p soon enough john is hooked onto it but something supernatural doesn t like him interfering with the dead as now other then contacting his wife the white noise is foretelling events before they happen since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn t my copy but then again i don t think the owners were in a hurry to get it back as they haven t question me about it oh well so i decided to give it a play as i was in an undemanding mood after hearing and reading all the bad press on it i wasn t expecting anything remotely good but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes well more so the 60 minutes as the last half an hour was pretty much a blur of confusion the film is nowhere as good as it could have been but the time breezed by quick enough even though it s a rather tepid supernatural thriller i thought it wasn t all a waste the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there s a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film that s when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn t fit in with the context it becomes rather hectic loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera work that gets to close into the action i couldn t understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey it s a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big but hits rock bottom i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera work other then the distinctively stark lighting the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware which makes it come across as very sterile and empty you can easily see that the film s heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story there s just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material after a while it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood curdling stuff from beyond the grave it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while the e v p machine was the star on the show well it did have more impact than the limp performances michael keaton is more than capable actor but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers he really deserves much better though everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable not because of the performances but of the lack of depth in their characters this clunker wasn t bad to begin with but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically i wouldn t care to see it again and i wouldn t recommend to anyone unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror thrillers it s just a damn shame that this over produced flick couldn t put it together successfully as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand i didn t hate it but what a disappointment 
__label__0 i gave 1 to this film i can t understand how ettore scola one of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial boring and not interesting too long too boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film 
__label__1 this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full length feature films the concept was really cool and different the humor was unique i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the punch into this movie so many lines and gags were left hanging too long with no definite ending and really didn t leave me laughing wilson wilson farris thurman were great wanda sykes was under used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time 7 out of 10 for me more of a dvd rental also i was looking for some sort of a feel good music video during the end credits something that has become sort of a trade mark to these romantic comedy films a la something about mary meet the parents but again i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines it felt like it was rushed into theaters 
__label__0  true story of three girls who go into the wilds of connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty years ago to mixed acclaim not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results the film is watchable but isn t at all scary blame how some of the attack scenes for that its the sort of film that you ll probably forget about once you re done with it odds are that you re never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told here watch this which is what happened to me if you re handed a copy give it back the film isn t worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable 
__label__1 i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very last entry in the popular saga and it s a very good one as were several of these i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character and also mark hamill as an actor after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks they weren t so bad i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and i felt there was a lot of well realized emotion with this chapter the ending with some new additions i presume successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn t already know i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity oh and err carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit 
__label__0 nothing happens then characters with no personality don t develop then the end never comes because there s no beginning and no middle there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren t even allowed to be because this movie isn t even there there s no is in this movie because there s no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point there s nothing there is a good point it has a good soundtrack but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn t even worth your time so if you re really interested i d suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something you ll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue headache and impatience polarisdib
__label__1 on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind warm the heart and touch the very soul lou is such a film i got lou from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business she watched it for a second time with me we were both enthralled her as if for the first time again lou is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place it does this while being relentlessly entertaining bret carr s acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen he crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like stuttering innocence but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you re watching a movie when the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax i saw my wife in tears for the second time as a life coach i facilitate individual growth and transformation and this film is a must see for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation it is a brilliant creative masterpiece with the power to change lives 
__label__0 over the years i ve seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley the entertainment level is at a low sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege under siege 2 and executive decision at least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications on the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter i honestly believe that more of segal s movies would do better if he wasn t the only one that fans recognize in the movie supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results 
__label__0 this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile after seeing it my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining this is a good example of a concept only film they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make just based on the initial concept the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them she simply couldn t hurt a flea this doesn t last too long after her release and she s back to her old ways period the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him and that is tough considering i am a die hard python fan it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money there can t be any other reason cruella s low self esteem servant tim mcinnerny was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny and it must have cost a few bucks to get gérard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were i am trying to block them out of my mind overall you d be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel 
__label__1 while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco this movie was shot in foggy romania in 18 days on a very tight budget however broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful nikolaj coaster waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy the script and direction provide some gems whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role other reviewers have pointed out staden s inadequacies as modesty blaise they may have a point but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage staden appears to be doing the same here 
__label__0 jenny neumann from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes the american slasher hell night and others is helen selleck an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production she s a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her meanwhile a black gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass major spoiler the killer is obviously helen she speaks in her dead mother s voice washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl but this has gratuitous heavy breathing pov camera work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it s supposed to be some big surprise the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even blackmailing their way into getting laid there s quite a bit of nudity and blood but there s no sense of continuity the photography is murky and the editing by colin eggleston who also scripted and produced is terrible the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavi s film of the same name and argento s opera both of which are better than this one by five years though and neumann is pretty hot 
__label__1 time and time again i ve stated that if people don t want remakes or sequels made they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film having said that though the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago so here s a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube the cure right away you can tell that the film is going for an avant garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups scopophilia and fast editing it is proud of the way it looks and it has a right to be for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece save for one inexcusable disregard for the 180 degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self funded projects still despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at we re presented with a good use of props and locations good visual acting and some very atmospheric fluid editing which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won t see very often at all from a youtube submission the plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening but what we are seeing here is avant garde storytelling at work you can t really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound what you re going to hear throughout is a distorted voice over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music which goes through minimal change and doesn t add much to anything so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected and this becomes really apparent when you realize you ve just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention so give it a watch but do it with the sound turned off last thought was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug naylor s red dwarf novel last human early in the film if you have the book you know what i mean 
__label__0 i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu whose masterfully understated views of japanese life especially in the post wwii era illuminate universal truths having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949 s late spring and 1953 s tokyo story i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery it is taiwanese director hou hsiao hsien s keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film among with co screenwriter t ien wen chu hsiao hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable the story concerns yôko a young japanese writer researching the life of mid 20th century taiwanese composer jiang wen ye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese after 25 drawn out minutes of character set up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan at the same time yôko s coffeehouse friend hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her hsiao hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains while these techniques are consistent with ozu s style hsiao hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular yôko s plight seems rather non committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents reaction overly passive to hold much interest in fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable j pop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yôko while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime the rest of the characters barely register even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yôko s parents cinematographer lee ping bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots hitoto speak sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits hito shian the dvd includes an hour long french made documentary métro lumière which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiao hsien s approach to the film it includes excerpts from ozu s films in particular equinox flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either tokyo story or early summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set ups there are also edited interview clips of hitoto asano and hsiao hsien as well as the film s trailer 
__label__0 i purchased this movie on blu ray because it promised great visuals and music i was also a great fan of a similar movie baraka the movie is very much styled after baraka wide angles very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot even some of the scenes were identical the street with traffic whereas baraka told a great story juxtaposing nature man made environments spirituality and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story mediocre musical score and then poof it s finished i thought there must be some sort of mistake history of the world half the movie is egypt and landscape looks like arizona but i didn t bother to check seriously folks this is horrible rent it if you must but do not buy it the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out

__label__0  look i know this may suck right now but pain is temporary film is forever whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come robert de nirothis was initially a film for steven spielberg the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro like jurassic park poltergeist and war of the worlds the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast the beast being the creation of the father a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial in typical spielberg fashion the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins like oscar schindler robin williams sam niel tom cruise and virtually every daddy figure in spielberg land the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese s filmography and ironically his most illuminating an artist s failures or misfires are often very revealing exposing the inner workings of their art when the story doesn t work the characters don t connect or the images don t sear we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core this the remaining carcass is what the director s cinema is about now cape fear is an impersonal film so we won t find any thematic connections to the rest of scorsese s filmography you already sacrificed me de niro yells but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter what the film does though is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on watch how scorsese s camera desperately whips back and forth how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention but more importantly watch how the film makes no spatial sense a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family s house doesn t seem to exist anywhere in particular there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment the reason for this is that scorsese s camera always has to be bound or intimately tethered to his central character for the world around the character to make sense his camera has to be focused on the character resnais can take you around a french hotel welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building cameron can give you a tour of the titanic scott can recreate an entire future cityscape lucas can give you an alien desert planet and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook close up mid shot wide shot combinations but scorsese can t do this there s no poetry no sense of tangible space in his films he s all about the character you break that tether you leave that boxing ring that taxi cab you look away from de niro and everything collapses he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting which in a way is a prerequisite for action film making scorsese tried to rectify this problem with gangs of new york where the space and the sets become the central character but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis the actor drawing scorsese s camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb 5 10 even as a generic b movie this is an ugly vulgar looking film look at the matte paintings the inept attempts at tension the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown still we have robert de niro to pick up the slack de niro who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ gives the film its only great scene in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her a kind of symbolic rape the girl runs away both aroused and repelled by this man s interest but de niro s performance so deliciously over the top simply can t be imitated by scorsese you d need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work but scorsese nope worth one viewing 
__label__0 i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out since i was a huge snl fan when my boyfriend and i went to see it the people coming out of the early show were yelling don t waste your money but of course we had to find out for ourselves while there were a few funny bits laser bra 2000 root boy slim most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show it was pretty bad when the opera singer came on many people got up and walked out this made me laugh because i realized that o donoghue was just pressing people s buttons on purpose with this movie or else he was just insane whatever you don t need to waste your time watching it it s that bad 
__label__0 this is easily the worst presley vehicle ever which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made it is measurably worse than even the revolting happy ending song at the end of it happened at the world s fair and here i thought that moment when elvis buys all of the vendor s balloons for his girl and then the balloon vendor gets jiggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped i usually enjoy the random elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it this one however ought to be called live a little wish you were dead a little and makes stay away joe look like olivier playing othello here elvis plays greg who is essentially a hippie free lance photographer except for the establishment haircut after a fun morning of reckless driving he ends up at the beach where he is abducted by a woman who s name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her clearly michele carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic elizabeth taylor if i watched this without my glasses i would have thought it was late 1960 s liz playing the female lead she sics her dog on elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him the audience does not know about it either until elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house rather than having her arrested for kidnapping larceny and assault he goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent miss crazy pants had to spring for when stealing all of his belongings job one is working for don porter at a playboy type magazine job two is upstairs working for rudy vallee at a snobby fashion magazine i think the two job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy too bad it isn t the least bit funny unless you d laugh the 100th time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast motion to silly music the predominate obstacle that keeps greg from falling for his abductor is her other love interest the dreadfully miscast dick sargent let s face it either porter or vallee even given their advanced ages in 1968 would have made far more believable competitors for miss crazy s affections there are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns i kept waiting for something anything to happen that would make all of this make sense it never did entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of elvis rendition of a little less talk which i can listen to on cd without this painful movie inflicted upon me and a funny five second bit where elvis flops on the couch and crazy pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it that s it folks busted furniture the only laugh in this entire film no amount of mod sixties clothing music or décor can salvage this high heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self infliction of grave bodily harm 
__label__0 i have watched anime but i m not a die hard fan and i don t read manga i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background i have seen st john s wort and although it isn t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination it made me pick up shinobi especially since everyone seems to love it well i watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching yes it s very beautiful the slow motion water scenes the autumn leaves on the trees even the cgi eye flicker majestic i liked the hawk the costumes even some of the fight scenes but overall this was dull as dirt it seemed as if someone took romeo and juliet the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers and threw in some x men for good measure two of the characters split wolverine s powers the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey haired guy had his ability to heal himself then you have the girl who has a poison kiss that s poison ivy from batman why do they give these women such dumb powers poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death man that s some great power for you and the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands the other woman one of the star crossed lovers has the power of a hypnotic stare wow i sort of made it to the end of the film by fast forwarding it and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected some people are comparing this to house of flying daggers and hero don t make that mistake they may share similar endings but that s where the similarities end shinobi is made by an amateur the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker i would say avoid this film unless you re 12 to 18 years old 
__label__0  spoiler alert i love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an unbelievable role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but it s convoluted unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away rene z tries hard with an underwritten part and so does patricia arquette the detective whose name i can t remember the one that s not chris penn is a big sweaty over actor see it if you re not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can t follow it and so confusing you can t understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise rent the usual suspects 
__label__1 julia ross nina foch agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family s estate in cornwall when she awakens they keep telling her she s marion hughes has been mentally ill and keep her locked up but why you ll probably guess why but won t mind because this one is fun along with the narrow margin and face behind the mask this is one of the best b pictures ever made b pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars it s just as long as it needs to be only 65 minutes is well directed fast paced and exciting it only stumbles at the end which i found a bit too implausible to buy foch a good actress is just ok in the lead but dame may witty is great and george macready is excellent and frightening as the villains well worth catching a perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget 
__label__1 i saw this movie a few months ago on cable and it was fantastic william h macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing he makes you care for his character even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing and neve campbell gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance i have seen by an actress this year she is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years donald sutherland is just plain creepy as macy s father and john ritter is fine as a shrink stuck in the middle of everything that is happening i wish that this was in the theater because i feel that it s a movie that should be view by a wider audience that s a shame because it s a hell of allot better that most of the new movies coming into the theater now 
__label__1 this one is considered a key pre code film from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story 1946 but also the paranoid sci fi invasion u s a 1952 and features one of barbara stanwyck s best early roles she s supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day george brent douglass dumbrille edward van sloan nat pendleton and john wayne at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter robert barrat as stanwyck s father donald cook as her most tragic conquest alphonse ethier as her elderly mentor more on this later arthur hohl as a lecherous politician and henry kolker as cook s boss and father in law whom stanwyck also seduces curiously scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors abetted by crackling i e typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual ethier stanwyck complains to him early on that she s no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy directed by howard hawks and co starring gary cooper of that name under ethier s auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she s eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one relating to an ambitious statesman s lust for power in sergei eisenstein s october 1927 sociologically it s also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companion the first two thirds of the film are simply terrific at first i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced george brent character while he ignores her but just like the others he s soon under her spell on second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring as it s evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as it s possible released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection the film is presented in two strikingly different edits a recently unearthed pre release version and the tamer theatrical release print among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck s life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it s heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been shortened i e censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only brent appears in the version released to theaters etc tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the pre release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which basically has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche 
__label__0 alien love as this movie is known in britain is a very strange movie i don t mean that it s an esoteric art house movie in the style of peter greenaway or derek jarman i mean it s a tvm with swearing sex some really good t a a bad script and a very retro feel you can just imagine someone like john hughes directing this ten years earlier though of course he would have cut out the t a going back to the bad script one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially amanda why does she pick up connie at the bar just so she could meet an alien do you see what i mean about retro et short circuit and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here the storyline continues to follow an ill defined unconvincing and illogical path that said i did find alien love watchable and not only down to the t a on display as a a sci fi sex comedy it s much better than flesh gordon and earth girls are easy
__label__1 the best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny there is lots of sentimentality kurt russell playing reno hightower puts in one of his best performances and robin williams playing jack dundee is sure footed as ever the cast also includes many great supporters jack s wife is played by jack palance s daughter who is lovely as is reno s wife who is a great comedian i can t tell you how many times i ve watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it 
__label__1 the first time i saw this film i was in shock for days afterwards its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music the ending quite simply had me gasping first rate 
__label__0 the film attempts to be a mockumentary shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary also the film purports to be about finding real love in los angeles but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big movie 
__label__0 i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched and i would also say rushed it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn t fully make sense for example jane mr rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage the actors don t have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story the actors are good but aren t given enough time to do this story justice i m sorry to say it but i didn t really enjoy this version the 1970 version with susanna york george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke timothy dalton in the 2 main roles i love it so much i watch it regularly there is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins 
__label__0 before starting to watch the show i ve heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting what a deception the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers and what about the sfx and colors they are so extreme that it is painful to watch colors are not saturated they are over saturated like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best they are sufficient unfortunately for this show the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility 
__label__1 i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed it s very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise i d say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear factor it had elements of the shining the 6th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare 
__label__0 are you kidding me a show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal how talented do you have to be to do this she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half hour stomach churning painful production i know she has a martha stewart esquire empire so does warren buffett but i don t see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and alpo she has a nephew named brycer brycer stop talking about anyone a name that stupid more time is spent on table scapes than actual cooking who has that kind of time silicon should be on your spatula not on my tv this show should be on cartoon network not food network 
__label__0 cq is incredibly slow and i m a david mamet fan the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very barbarella esque film after that the movie started to lose me deep and profound not really the movie dragonfly being made in cq has the problem of having no ending this greatly parallels cq which also lacks an ending in my opinion i was lucky enough to catch this movie at the sxsw film festival i had fairly high expectations having just watched y tu mama tambien and several other great movies i was also looking forward to jason schwartzman s performance but it was not an easy film to get into if you re not into 60 s sci fi or slow movies that go no where skip it cq feels like a student film if you want a recent sci fi esque indie film rent donnie darko it won t put you to sleep 
__label__0 the title says it all tail gunner joe was a tag given to the senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about world war ii aircraft the rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail when the senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane he couldn t have done that if the gun had been properly aligned the gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible he had made the error not the senator the fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one sided it is this film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person a much better program was the pbs special done on him he was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights he made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them the popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one sided stories so that they don t have to think 
__label__1  erendira is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about the film only exists in a low quality vhs format it s a shame this film hasn t been given a dvd release erendira is stunning and gorgeous with its magic realist images erendira is based on a short story from the novel 100 years of solitude erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma s house her evil grandma played by irene papas forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages the whole town gets a piece of erendira so to speak although the subject matter sounds harsh the film doesn t exploit sexuality it s done in a mature artistic manner the film also has some amazing costumes some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the origami birds that morph into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center erendira is an amazing film that even manages to throw in humor this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release as they d say in espanol es muy muy bien excellente 
__label__1 despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced presented in digestible as digestible as war can be episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u s the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year 
__label__1 i was waiting to see this movie from a long time it s promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it i really find it was quite well made most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate the editing and direction were also good meghna gulzar really did a good job here to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer 
__label__0 opening scene explains why hurt is later immune to the contaminated man too bad it doesn t explain anything else how did he get whatever he caught what was it why does it work so fast then we go to present day budapest ok was the opener in the past or the future it turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning sorry i should have paid closer attention huh or maybe it s just badly done then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he s had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him aha so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects he must have been one of the top guys he s friends with the c e o of the chemical company for god sakes then there s the substance itself technically a poison but it mutates in immune carriers so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an allergic reaction all very different things in real life magically it s not contagious from one dying victim to another only from the carrier how convenient then there s the h a z m a t protocol they jump into a situation without having any idea what s in store or how prepare for it did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all 
__label__1 this movie is a half documentary and it is pretty interesting this is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany this movie isn t perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves if you re interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that s worth a look 
__label__1 don t believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives yes it is cheaply made yes the gore is laughable and yes the acting is sub par however this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing its mine then you will enjoy this one there are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks for one the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly the ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies and last but not least the setting is what made the film for me the makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college dorm however if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great four collegiates all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down it reaks of possibility when watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as i did 
__label__0 a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot if anything the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo with a strong dose of erotica only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful here we get the usual group of people an acting troupe stranded on an island to which they were invited by a count since he had become enamored of the leading lady a dead ringer for his missing spouse the characters are pretty much stereotypes middle aged but dashing hero played by giacomo rossi stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy demure heroine sluttish companion recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot a meek but devoted stage manager forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior a couple of lesbians a mysterious gardener the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who for once gets in on the action if you know what i mean an envious housekeeper nominal star femi benussi though for what it is worth this is really an ensemble piece a religious fanatic of a butler an impressionable chambermaid etc while the film is not by any means unwatchable the atrocious dubbing snail s pace shoddy production with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black and white film and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half hour do not help matters besides marcello giombini s score though pleasant in itself comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances that said the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here 
__label__0 this is the only film i ve seen that is made by uwe boll i knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that house of the dead is one of imdb bottom 100 but i still wanted to watch it because i m a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what doe s the film have that makes it so bad after watching it i do agree that it is crap the movie had no story in the first 15 20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain dead or the girls are then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes is it supposed to be a comedy or horror or both before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it which is a good thing the film is a true insult to the classic game uwe boll please do not make any more films thank you 
__label__0 the imdb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain spoilers well this whole film is something of a spoiler a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against a tale of lost youth that doesn t know where it itself is going i just saw this at the tribeca film festival this film wasn t just bad it was really bad the acting is inconsistent the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth and farnsworth s acting was very bad in particular from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place graphic elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios it sucked the big one i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy updated drugstore cowboy with a touch of natural born killers but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking outside of some frat level gore as the ladder more than anything someone needed to really a edit the screenplay there are some things in there to build on and clearly deals with a worthy subject if ham handed in it s attempt b edit the film if it was cut down to a core it might be passable i would go lower than 1 if i could like maybe zero kelvin 
__label__1 this isn t masterpiece theater you shouldn t go into it expecting that this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads like someone else here said this is the film baby mama was meant to be and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in it besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet the film is pure silliness on the surface but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape 
__label__1 sure this movie wasn t like 16 blocks inside man an american haunting etc but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scary i live exactly where they filmed this movie san pedro california and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie i dunno if you ve heard of the famous boat in long beach queen mary well that boat is haunted i believe in spirts illusions and parallel or however u spell that is real everybody s in there own universe and the mind is a powerful thing i recommend to watch this movie it s great and not bad directing at all for those who rate it a 1 they don t understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us ty victor
__label__0 well the big money machine has done it again disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video good or bad stamped with the disney moniker why is it that i continue to look forward to these sequels which make don bluth on a bad day look like leonardo davinci cinderella 2 consists of three storylines already a poor choice doesn t one of the most endearing disney creations at least deserve a linear story of these three only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that i would expect the music is atrocious and modern meaning in 2 years it will already be dated and adds nothing to the story why does everything have to be updated you know the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style gee i can t wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty instead of music based on the themes of tchaikovsky we ll get music inspired by britney spears so disney if you re listening remember we re not all indiscriminate children out here how about throwing a bone or two to the fans who ve been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap 
__label__1 shakespeare s plays have a way of transcending time the language somehow breaks the time barrier but perhaps it is the actors who really do that after the disappointment in romeo and juliet the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was great iago s character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even thoough iago is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that fishburne s performance here was really good as well i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students who refuse to read the book alike 
__label__1 after all these years of peter o tool s brilliant costly giving of his soul film after film at last hollywood tosses him an oscar recently country dance showed up one night late and of course blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged life how does he do it york again also is brilliant in this kind of play both psychological battleships loaded for bear bravo to author director cast and camera crew no wonder the nazi s lost to these irish scot english blends brutal honesty hurts back in the 70 s when i personally believed honesty was pure and absolutely vital to trust i have modified my edgy extremes and will settle for more human warm flaws within myself and others forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes 
__label__0 i caught sorrows lost at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film sadly this is just another visual fx calling card the story is pretty lame the bad lighting and camera work along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality is it really too much to ask that fx shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the fx you can t just get away with cool fx in shorts anymore it s been 5 years since 405 made a big splash at least that short quick cool and was even a little funny none of that can be said about sorrows lost 
__label__1 like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie on tv never on the big screen when i was a teenager my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then and i must say he was not only right but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time i have seen it two or three more times since then just a few days ago i gave it another watch and it has not lost anything of its impact with time it still a great and well worth to be seen movie manr regard peckinpah s ride the high country as one of the first and best later western which had a realistic look at life in the old west but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time or maybe it still is although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western i like this genre i can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one two men bound together partly by hate partly by not seeming to have other choices surrounded by beautiful ms padget a crippled old man and a young inian leading the life of buffalo killers until fate reaches out for one of them nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem when the camera moves on and away from mr taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight on a tree and echos from the past when all the hatred began are present again mr taylor has got his buffalo but in the end the buffalo got him aside from the top performances of everybody involved the intelligent script and the great dialogue it should also be mentioned that the last hunt is superbly photograped i have seldomely seen a western that well shot aside from the ones directed by anthony mann which are also all superbly photographed that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well and director brooks is really a superb storyteller master craftsmanship he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre but even in an as prolific career as this one the last hunt still shines as one of his best if not his best definitely would deserve a higher rating compared to the 7 something ride the high country enjoys 
__label__1 romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing emma based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role a self appointed matchmaker emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend harriet toni collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying meanwhile her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr knightley jeremy northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma s and lend some needed balance to the proceedings and emma so concerned with what is right for others neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own the world goes round and love abounds but emma is about to miss the boat luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings now if she can but stop long enough to realize it but as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma she must first recognize it and seize the moment mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world there may be an air of frivolity about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone love and with mcgrath s impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable it s a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place it s light fare but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow the winsome paltrow who won the oscar for best actress for shakespeare in love two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre she personifies all things british and does it with such naturalness and facility that it s the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether she s simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of audrey hepburn yet paltrow is unique as an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as hard eight hush and a perfect murder that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own but it s with characters like emma that she really shines she is so expressive and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing and for emma she is absolutely perfect jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley and like paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent the golden bowl in which he played an italian prince was less than satisfying here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real like colin firth s mr darcy in the miniseries pride and prejudice northam has created a memorable character with his own mr knightley also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette as emma s friend harriet smith and alan cumming as the reverend elton respectively collette and cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genre the supporting cast includes greta scacchi mrs weston denys hawthorne mr woodhouse sophie thompson miss bates kathleen byron mrs goddard phyllida law mrs bates polly walker jane fairfax and ewan mcgregor frank churchill an uplifting elegant film emma is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness and even if it s only through the magic of the silver screen it s nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit and that s the magic of the movies i rate this one 9 10 
__label__0 i thought intensive care was quite bad and very unintentionally funny but at least not as bad as i thought it might be sometimes it s somewhat suspenseful but never a good shocker spoiler aheadthe fun lies in ridiculous moments but the all time classic moment is this peter koen wauters is stabbed and beaten by the killer he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway amy nada van nie kneels beside him and asks poor peter shall i get you a band aid this movie was shot in dutch and english to spare costs all license plates are usa and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan very funny if you re dutch and watching the original version in dutch 
__label__0 oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie i have ever seen the acting is bad the story is weak the characters are weaker and the whole film just doesn t make sense couple this with mediocre directing really strange scenes such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in and thoroughly abysmal dialog look musta peed his pants and you get one complete failure not to mention the fact that the only thing mr atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars but this is part of the movie s charm sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh i love this movie because it s just so bad 
__label__0 this is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke i personally don t care one way or another about jessica simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her just as a movie this is something that wouldn t even get a passing grade in film school the script is a mess the acting is atrocious and the fact luke wilson co writer of bottle rocket did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking he did old school for crying out loud this doesn t even belong in the same state as my old school dvd please for whatever reason do not watch this i see there is a comment that this is so bad it s good but that frankly is too kind when will we stop seeing singers that obviously can t act keep trying to i hope ends soon the worst part is that there are actually some decent actors penelope ann miller rachel leigh cook luke wilson who are part of this dump as far as the plot well it is almost non existent and so poorly done and written yes i know it s another rehash i very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this please whatever you do don t waste your time but if you do feel sorry for the actual actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb jessica simpson you re pretty but stick to singing although i m not much a fan of that either and whoever did this film i wouldn t put this on your resume 1 10 because you can t give a zero 
__label__0 it s interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films while the heiress was a good if not entirely accurate adaptation washington square is a heavy handed and poorly acted except for the part of dr sloper film that could have been so much better the director s attempts at making beautiful scenes were so obvious that i actually cringed it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have such as onegin i agree with other comments about leigh s portrayal of catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy she made me despise her not feel for her catherine s transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism the whole point of the story was internalised just as it was in the novel but we don t have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film i think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool i appreciate the director s attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didn t work 
__label__1 this is a great british film a cleverly observed script with many quotable lines which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors geoff bell peter bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece although it seems to be billed as a biker movie i think it will find an audience outside of this purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t shirt also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of freebird this really could be a 21st century heir to the famous ealing comedies like the weed in the welsh fields it s a grower 
__label__0 i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 back when the tickets actually sold for 1 this is the only film i have ever walked out on with my friend while the idiocy that is the laser bra 2000 sketch was on screen evidently my and my friend s reaction to the film was a common one it is not that i found the film offensive either as an 18 year old or now but rather that it is mind numbingly stupid and patently unfunny devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it rather than a failure to comprehend mr mike s vision unless of course his vision was to drive the film s backers into bankruptcy i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published 10 worst films of all time list it certainly makes mine you have been warned 
__label__0 i am partly a fan of miyazaki s work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring sadly this film falls into the later category this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki s recent film howl s moving castle an intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it the first third of the film reveals the post apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold from then on things go down hill the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly veiled eco propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators what is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version i saw was an nth generation copy with poor colour which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused 
__label__1  ruby in paradise is a beautiful coming of age story about a young woman ruby lee gissing escaping her stifling roots to become herself although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether jesus mother or the lurid attention hungry singer it instead emphasizes following ones instincts and being somewhat introspective about them to grow into one s ideal adult self note this isn t an action movie it uses an occasional voice over narration by ms judd while writing in her journal and oh i see i ve just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that one s bliss can be discovered in oh i dunno carrying water and chopping wood actor director writer todd field who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut co stars as ruby lee s noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there s no external hero imposed upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writer director victor nunez who also wrote directed ulee s gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself confronting age old challenges of good v evil along the way the supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone burnett is right on most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes pavlovian and unbidden not sure if it s the music or the indelible connection to the movie s quiet charming message of empowerment this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his her way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on air on an indie channel usually you can t count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world so buy a copy for yourself this movie should have a major re release and it would if i were queen of hollywood figgy jones
__label__0 what a poor image of professional police officers is displayed on the television in the watching of this alleged reality show one can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a stop then the pat down of the outside of one s garment then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someone s pocket and retrieved contraband was cut out of the scenes because if it wasn t the arrest in most places are going to be tossed should they even get passed a supervisor a report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand if the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout it is good enough for an arrest but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect since i haven t seen a dis claimer from cbs i may have missed it cbs could be in trouble

__label__1 sandra bernhard s without you i m nothing the movie released in 1990 followed on the heels of her 1988 off broadway stage production what she and others refer to in the movie as her smash hit one woman show there were several changes in monologues and one liners and the movie version visually re vamps the story taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york during what she calls her superstar summer to an illusory almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back to her roots to upscale supper clubs like the parisian room there s a point to be made here sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn t completely see it in l a she s playing to a predominantly black audience trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is shashonna a madonna look alike stripper and even then with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from like a virgin there s not much to be said for the audience s enjoyment of the show the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants but if she s going down sandra s doing so with style and force conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability right to the point at which she s naked literally pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein jerry lewis bianca jagger ralph lauren and what we re lead to believe is warren beatty are fictional and hilarious sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone s song four women while dressed in a mufti and other african garb singing lines such as my skin is black my hair is wooly and they call me sweet thing she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product that they ve been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him saying mister if this is about ishtar i m getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that s too self indulgent even for me sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism dressed as a cosmo girl sandra retells her young girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss she eventually concludes in relief i ll never be a statistic not me i m under 35 and i m going to be married sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society when he touches you in the night does it feel all right or does it feel real i say it feels real mighty real finally she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming eventually everyone will funk all this comes in the form of glitzy schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul burt bacharach hank williams and laura nyro to name a few at the same time the idealized fictional incarnation of sandra her self generated mirror image floats around town a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music in without you i m nothing sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that up until then she d only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman her almost child like enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the 80s is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing this approach to comedy would change sandra s direction forever and mark the more mature more personable entertainer to come if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour celebrity sex loneliness despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship this movie will keep you in stitches it may not be meant to be funny across the board perhaps it s a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you and you ll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is but see without you i m nothing with a friend in the know because it s definitely funnier that way before you know it the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else 
__label__0 slackers is just another teen movie that s not really worth watching dave devon sawa sam jason segel and jeff michael c maronna are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying cheating and scheming the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now during final exams these big men on campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school the plot is very stupid and there s no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but there s no real true funny or original moment in the movie its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny though for every joke that works there s at least eight more that don t the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy even if they do they probably won t remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you can t blame him too much the funniest character was probably laura prepon though she s not in the movie very much the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however that may be too long for some people who don t really like this type of humor slackers isn t the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average when compared to other films in the genre there s a lot better out there such as not another teen movie american pie and its sequels scary movie 1 2 etc so unless you have seen most of them and you re looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else rating 4 3 10 a below average teen comedy that s worth skipping

__label__1 call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you haven t had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of voyager s caretaker which launched the series with cpt janeway archer s adventures are completely different yet strangely familiar the music is catchy too no true sci fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode and these installments make the wait worthwhile 
__label__1 four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixed up parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit she s never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can t slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard or an even longer sequence also with baio where foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i didn t much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and jodie s face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this it doesn t pander for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand from 
__label__0 everybody just seems to be raving about the subject and not really noticing how the movie was made the deaf mute guy is fine the underdog wins that s good the cricket aspect is great but the movie is average overall i think it could be made much much better than it is the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event i m sure the movie could have been made more interesting the songs are just stuffed in there and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles good acting though watchable 
__label__0 we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable just terrible
__label__0 recap according to legend the valkyrie brunhilda defied odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire only a warrior pure in heart can pass through the flames free brunhilda and release her from odin s claim and have her for himself now war is brewing in the norse lands and the king needs an alliance with the berserkers the berserkers are warriors claimed by odin s valkyries lusting for war blood and flesh and therefore outcasts but superior in battle the leader of the berserkers is a scorned son of the king boar and his price for the alliance is his brother the future king barek but after the king is victorious in battle he refuses to give up his only remaining son breaking his oath to boar and betray him and kill him boar is saved only by barek s call upon odin but this is only the start of the battle between the brothers and their final battle is about to start now a millennia later comments i had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some viking ground far too little quality movie about viking has been done it started out very good too with detailed longships and armors nice and fitting sceneries and an ok battle the foundation in the aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me odin is much more vengeful spiteful and absent than i remind him from school and the valkyries has been turned into some vampire demons i m no expert but that seems outright wrong but the fatal mistake made by this movie is to move the time setting from the original time period to today if the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time with some decent battles this movie would have been much better now the setting suddenly is changed to present day stockholm still odin is present and is sending boar and his berserkers for brunhilda and barek which gives silly scenes when armor clad and painted berserkers swordfights with barek among the industries beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement and when allowed to focus upon single fights instead of massive battles as in the beginning i quickly saw that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy the end result is thin story sometimes hard to follow and other times just silly and the only that could save it the action is drawn from slow dull and clumsy swordfights it draws very little from aesir myth or viking tradition thus both story and action fails and the movie is just plain bad finally as a swede this movie is a little confusing supposedly filmed entirely in south africa it still contains some familiar swedish signs plates and what seems to be an authentic police car however the effort is poor and only goes so far as to really set it in sweden no names are swedish perhaps with anya as the exception no familiar sceneries are swedish they supposedly speak a little ancient norwegian not swedish and uniforms both police and medical are clearly not swedish if they were not going to even try to do it correctly and really give the illusion that it is set in sweden why bother at all 4 10

__label__0 i caught this cuban film at at an arthouse film club it was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 silly symphony cartoon where the isle of symphony is reconciled with the isle of jazz what with the recently deceased ruben gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema ballroom and a cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of helms burton but then the film started and the cinema s peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on screen the storyline of nada mas promises much carla is a bored envelope stamper at a cuban post office her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them transforming basic interpersonal grunts into brontëan outbursts of breathless emotion cue numerous shots of photogenic cubans gushing with joy grief pity terror and the like the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film school artiness latino caricature marx brothers slapstick and even during a particularly underwhelming editing trick the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character s face unidimensional characters abound cunda the boss at the post office is a humourless dominatrix nosferatu her boss eyed accomplice concha variously points fingers eavesdrops and screeches cesar the metalhead dolt and romantic interest reveals hidden writing talent when carla departs for miami a chase scene in oh so hilarious fast forward is thrown in for good measure all this would be fine in a mortadello and filemon comic strip but in a black and white zero fx flick with highbrow pretensions ahem nada mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the quirky heroine matchmakes strangers of amelie and the poetry as great redeemer theme of il postino like amelie its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers and like il postino the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead unfortunately nada mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film there are two things that might merit watching this film in a late night tv stupor the first is the opening overhead shot of carla on a checker tiled floor which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on the second is to see nada mas as a cautionary example our post buena vista social club obsession with cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack this film should not have merited a global release films such as waiting list and guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully

__label__0 i have this film out of the library right now and i haven t finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although she d pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film it s really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadow who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffany s twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious you sure don t have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburn s chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like ann margret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid level situations hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50 s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesn t take it seriously at all couldn t be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many ways and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomson s oft used phrase losing his her talent never has made more sense ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn who could ask for anything less sandra dee s last pitiful film lost from 2 years later a low budget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 audrey hepburn s accent just sounded silly she d go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculous to think that breakfast at tiffany s was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuff corny witless and stifling i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn s singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffany s and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation a great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nun s story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50 s and 60 s who became a truly bad one that s not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly which all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburn s miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill 
__label__1 there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately a friend sends me movies now and again as a surprise it s awesome i turned it on and couldn t stop watching it is a drama but with a odd twist imagine if romeo as in shakepeare had a super power it is sad and poetic at the same time hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist granted it s not perfect but nothing ever is you know what the power is but it is never explained nor totally realized until the end it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story i don t want to see a remake it is too cool as is the hollywood system would as usual mess it up acting is top notch all around directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there kudos to all involved and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic a if you can find i watch it 
__label__1 kim patricia clarkson george jake weber and son miles erik per sullivan are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan s bustling metropolis on the way they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along rather than helping at least one of the hunters otis john speredakos is mad because the accident cracked the buck s antlers george kim and miles are disturbed by otis and even worse we quickly learn that otis has learned where they re staying meanwhile miles is given a wendigo a kind of indian shape shifting spirit monster token by an indian whom only he has seen is otis a psycho out to get our heroes are there wendigos in the woods i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers it is a fairly low budget film with technical limitations frequently showing through much of the film and maybe all of it is not really about the titular creature and perhaps the fatal blow for many people it has a very ambiguous ending with a number of questions left unanswered if you are discouraged by such endings and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo personally i like films like that i usually prefer some ambiguity the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick scary creature flick where they d expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 the monster returns but that s not what this film is wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people heck writer director larry fessenden even has a character george reciting robert frost the frost poem and george s comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things is the key to the film one of the best things about the film is its complexity in a way there are four different films occurring at the same time a thread from each character in george s thread he isn t exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world and he has some parenting problems for him the film is a realistic horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse in patricia s thread she s looking for rejuvenation of her life and family she s a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her hoping that they ll go away and get better in otis thread he s even more down on his luck than george and george s arrival into his life symbolizes the final crack in his psychological armor and in miles thread which is probably the most important of the film life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world but this is a horror story after all albeit one with a glimmer of hope and the events in the film give miles poetic interpretations a dark turn still when everything is said and done he seems to be the only one retaining his composure due to the poetic outlook even though the film is low budget there are a lot of well executed higher budget ambitions fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations and created some interesting slide show like montages such as the cards or the indian wendigo images from the book there are also interesting more traditional montages such as miles nightmare wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films other technical aspects are good for the budget the wendigo appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous the lighting was usually good there were a few times that dark scenes weren t as clear as they could have been but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock it could have been digital instead or transfer i thought the performances were good and far more realistic if you value that than the majority of films although i didn t really notice the score it must have been okay or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment overall wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions as long as you don t mind having to think about the movies you watch 
__label__1 for me this movie was powerful i don t want to be a spoiler but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers this movie brought back some vivid memories for some reason i couldn t place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 i kept getting a message like no votes have been placed and yet i saw in the stats that there were will try again tomorrow monday minor flaws i overlooked it was the relationships between the characters that got me beautifully acted and real situations i ve been in a couple of them a small gem of a movie just like spring forward is another overlooked gem i m very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people well written sensitively unfolded with first class acting and direction after all isn t that what it s all about 
__label__0 what s with indonesian musical movies never have i seen indonesian musical movies like the ones made in bollywood they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of what they called poetic lines this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks it s a simple story plot but it s quite focused though with meant to be musical story lines here and there confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected the main actress may try to live up the character but it s the best that she could do trying as for the casting i don t feel the necessity to put a balinese student in that story and of course that s not the only unnecessary characters the strange thing is why would i want to watch this movie maybe because of the mangoes 
__label__0 why why did they make this movie if timothy olyphant wasn t shirtless in it several times there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie ever um plot nope well defined characters nope the only time i laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she bang p s andy dick nope 
__label__0 this may be the worst show i ve ever seen aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler it just isn t funny or entertaining in any way it is very similar to a 1950 s sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in i love lucy it s just not funny here i think the show was based around the novelty look it s hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brits had us beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about lincoln s slave the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer chances are you ll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd 
__label__0 i saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard in these days of single mothers that may seem very far fetched but it was very true and i m not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny at that time i didn t know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had i did know who betty hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic i loved bringing up baby but i find this movie just embarrassing i m sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to get married and get pregnant just added to the misery an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part of course shoot me i don t like it s a wonderful life either 
__label__0 this film is just a shame orlando florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like vancouver s rise to prominance the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon i will try to be as honest as possible i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to give a new spin on the boy band craze after all both n sync and the backstreet boys come from this area but the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the amatuer actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written also a problem is the choice of jokes many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring some of the concert scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also don t seem to move the story along in any way i had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres quickly comedy isn t his strong suit but its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area its just a shame that right now he s infamous not famous 
__label__1 i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings well so i was and so i really love this movie especially i like all those flawless superheroes from lotr being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied most brilliantly is the counterpart of gandalf the brave and wise and completely humorless know it all wizard almghandi the cowardice and brain dead transvestite sauron s counterpart sauraus from east germany of course is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ulrike the legend with scotch tape and strunzdumm the counterpart of wormtong indeed has some strong resemblance with brad dourif and don t forget grmpfli and heidi huh huh
__label__1 vincent cassel plays the part of paul an ex con assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not played by emmanuelle devos together they help each other to develop as people what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that he s just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justified finally it is a film full of great moments both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort 
__label__1 is this the future that awaits us an overpopulated unforgiving wasteland with a hellish unwanted existence this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 let s hope that the world isn t going to end up like this soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much it had likable characters a semi apocalyptic setting a compelling and thought provoking storyline and the macho est macho man out there charleton heston richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant dirty feel you re almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants the characters are wonderful charleton heston who has become one of my favorite actors is thorn the man created this role of badass yet likable tough guy i could definitely put myself in thorn s shoes he sees that something isn t right but everyone around him either doesn t listen more like paid not to listen or wants him dead edward g robinson in his last film r i p plays the lovable old sol who has had enough of this nasty place everyone else is great especially leigh taylor young as shirl a piece of furniture that comes with the apartment in which she resides the special effects are fantastic even for 1973 the soylent green factory the futuristic apartments and especially the scoops bulldozers that get rid of people were excellent the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling one final note is the ending which even now still shocked me it is gruesome but if you think about it it s a pretty good idea the bottom line an excellent 70 s science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy 
__label__0 tim robbins is oddly benign here cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einstein s niece although he s on screen much of the time robbins cancels out the inner workings of his intense persona and fades into the background it s easy to forget he s even in the picture lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick that being walter matthau playing einstein who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character otherwise it s sugary and sunny directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi who shows heart but no wit or brains meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother from 
__label__1 rawhide was a wonderful tv western series focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor most episodes especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of favor and his men guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in rawhide was a true gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten thanks to eric fleming s performance the show became a massive hit of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors clint eastwood sheb wooley paul brinegar steve raines james murdoch rocky shahan robert cabal all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines for me some of the time this didn t work the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair the black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture rustlers indians commancheroes beautiful damsels in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through the reason eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body the gritty realism was gone gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting we shall not see his like again watch an episode whenever you can they seldom disappoint 
__label__1 the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional aimed at a long obsolete target hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all basil rathbone crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire after a while you don t notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda both versions gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol the other obvious candidate at the time the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it 
__label__0 i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them i rented this dvd from 2 movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the 3rd dvd player i tried anyone else have this issue it s really hard to give the film an un biased review after going through such a hassle to play it for one i ve never seen a finnish horror film before so i was sort of bummed that the movie was done in english also since it s never made clear what is wrong with sarah she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away 
__label__1 hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin i m not making this up they had several reasons as follows item jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter she stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says tarzan you ve been a bad boy so they ve not only been having sex they ve been having kinky sex a few years later under the hays code people especially women weren t supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex item jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage tarzan to a civilized respectable nine to five man holt when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london she wavers a bit when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe he s dead she wavers a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her and why not tarzan s and jane s relationship is egalitarian he lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that holt is jane s old flame when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow dancing with her to a portable phonograph tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope he s merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he s never seen one before once it s explained he s cool item civilized holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is innocently sexy as jane slips into holt s lamplit tent holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet the scene was filmed in three versions clothed topless and nude the scene was cut prior to the film s release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians nowhere that s where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful item the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for man s use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance and you re right he s shocked he exclaims elephants sleep which to him explains everything jane explains tarzan s feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous item jane the ex civilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the rifles item jane s costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scene lastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no comment of course tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came the end so there you have it an utterly subversive film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see e g possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30 s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane s soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions let s hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex 
__label__0 this film was probably inspired by godard s masculin féminin and i urge you to see that film instead the film has two strong elements and those are 1 the realistic acting 2 the impressive undeservedly good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film it s unattractive comparing to godard s film intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society a movie of its time and place 2 10 
__label__0 i must agree with the very first comment this movie sucks very very hard despite having a very big b list cast the cover of this film for those who aren t watching it on comedy central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get tries to put the blame on dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has been comedian from the 80s randy quaid check ed begley jr check the voice of lisa simpson she can now say that maximum overdrive wasn t her only horrible flick double check and so many many others the saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with already told jokes nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny you re better off watching paint dry this is definitely direct to video scraping the bottom of the barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage throw an old time star on the cover and you ll get some money back off of the rental considering the days of video rental are changing consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage the only use this movie has if you re having trouble falling asleep it ll get you there 
__label__1 this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990 s versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980 s period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90 s versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it 
__label__0 unless you are petrified of russian people or boars this movie is a snorefest actually i fell asleep about 40 minutes in had to fight the urge to just leave the theater i wish i had a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening even silent hill was scarier heck even pan s labyrinth was scarier i m still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick to begin with i m very leery of movies that use pidgin russian like this one did in the opening credits it s embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends we all cringed oh my god hmm well luckily for me probably you too this movie has already escaped my brain i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no specifics just murky visuals that go nowhere some languishing now dead hope that anything would happen perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can t believe it got such great reviews here which is why i saw it ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well i give it a 2 because yes i fell asleep wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up didn t leave 
__label__1 the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn t expect uma thurman performed as average in g girl s role surprisingly i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch g girl s and average matt s adventures especially to cheer up your partner 7 10 in my collection 
__label__1 this movie is utterly hilarious its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films the conflict of brother vs brother appears when johnny s brother becomes a do gooder d a however the best character is johnny s crimelord rival the overly accented moroni as johnny says that man should be arrested for butchering the english language check it out on video it s worth a look 
__label__0 i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off character s don t seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire i shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something i stopped caring a ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body question 0 out of stars 
__label__1 election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society a 100 year old trial society while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times big d is not only impatient but also thinks that he is on top of everything lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years to have the total control of the gang the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton which represents power and authority big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok while big d is getting the baton lok has other plans for him this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one however no single bullet is used hardly any gangfights are involved in election it s the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest apart from maggie shiu the only actress in election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie masculinity rules the whole movie louis koo and nick cheung who was seen in to s previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival 2005 election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie 
__label__0 i ve never really considered myself much of student when it comes to watching films i watch them form an opinion and that s it but unhinged changed all this this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i ve ever seen every kid who rocks up at university thinking they re gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled how not to make a film not only is there no story to be had the film makers weren t even competent enough to make a film worth watching it s been a while since i saw it but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes they are never ending it s almost like having your teeth pulled only not as much fun 
__label__1 even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent price s work gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the injustices against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he frightens you a little with his original fury as the film goes on his character becomes tragic he s committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up and again to cover that one up and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways a shame this one isn t available for home veiwing 
__label__0 josh hartnett s dead eyes the thick writing of it and harrison ford being in a buddy cop comedy here s 3 reasons to hate it avoid it and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better the buddy cop movies are fun however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than hollywood homicide what really did happen to this entertaining formula since a whole decade the things hadn t been the same you d have a buddy action stubborn flop after another i ll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well i spy 2002 national security 2003 taxi 2004 starsky hutch 2004 and the worst of them all yet miami vice 2006 i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already add to that particularly here the negligent dealing and the dull humor actually the matter this time is totally unbearable yes we ve got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs and the background of sinful city but what else was new it s not about cliché it s about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made the acting especially from hartnett s side is terrible this guy is anything but a comedian or actor so his character was wanting to revenge for his father s death revenge on yourself man he probably died out of watching your acting even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy or that s what they seemed here anyhow the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh some parts managed to be highly dull arresting the black guy through the lack it s a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action comedy they didn t utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm or even as a place which s full of shining or fallen stars cameos that could ve given it few interesting moments it s a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars glamour and as being a buddy cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non chemistry on the screen one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself guess who and a buddy cop destroyer more than movie god don t make me or my children live enough to witness hollywood homicide part 2 at last look at harrison ford s performance he wanted to have a good time but at least we didn t 
__label__0 ok the director remakes love actually the director nikhil advani after debuting with khnh does his second half and waithe makes a 3 30 hours film which loses on patience time etc the viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this filmok they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why 6 stories we have the anil juhi story convincing but boring don t tv serials show such stories we have govinda shannon story which is funny and works well we have akshaye ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedywe have salman priyanka story which is the worst not just acting terms it makes no sense at allwe have sohail isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other storieswe have john vidya story a good story in all respectsbut then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy the climax isn t appealing though especially the climax of salman priyanka story nikhil advani s handling is alright at places some stories are well handled but weak at places music sel is good but too many songs cinematography is nice every story is given a different look texture and it worksactors govinda rocks after a dismissal comeback with bb he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight anil kapoor acts his part well though he looks out of shape and tired john excels in his part akshaye khanna overacts for a changesohail khan is too over the top and isha has nothing to do anjana suknani is dismissalpriyanka and salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked salman khan doesn t act only just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her she does get better towards the end vidya balan is good juhi chawla is okay shannon is okay
__label__0 i saw this recently with my wife and discovered it s better than caine believes although it s not much cop britain s greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing rex harrison seems even less bothered perhaps unsurprisingly as his character is very poorly written william holden is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman as i have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film s serious tone the music is poor and omar sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos his career has been based on this for decades now richard fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies 
__label__0 although i use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what i think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films after watching this movie on film four last night i felt compelled to write something down even if it just helps cleanse me once again the film was possibly the shallowest experience i ve ever had the main characters played by danny dyer 23 you sure and gillian anderson who will always be scully as leonard nimoy will always be spock had no real substance about them i m not sure if the first half hour of the film didn t make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims here i couldn t care less in fact the only character i did seem to care about was the dog with the stag coming a close second and both animals out acted dire sic and scully who were quite frankly terrible i guess though you re only as good as the script you are given and i d like to warmly thank the writers the producers the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity 
__label__0 okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie first off the movie is so posed and not real they are all acting they can t sing they are way too full of themselves its awful yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid i mean they say their manager is a kid and there record label is fake its stupid don t see it as for the set up and directing not so bad it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing only see this if you don t really like good music also it s very corny it s not even tasteful i hate to be so mean but this really is a piece of junk 
__label__0 i saw it i agree with him 100 but i didn t care for his delivery he just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign edit cuts galore etc the camera would be focused on him and you d see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film no no this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags to make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or he could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon founder who had quite the colorful past delve into science v s religion one is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims it is so because well i said so done right i d say turn it into an hbo original series hit a different religion every week it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good ole g w bush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blind bill moyer well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at sutra in newport beach 
__label__1 one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killers zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self promoter the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold case style thriller it is an intelligent investigative procedural style horror film that will put off gore hounds in search of cheap thrills some people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very old style and provincial it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is a low budget film no doubt but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem 
__label__1 the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good but still not work if the audience doesn t believe that the actor is portraying the person that s the main issue with young mr lincoln henry fonda gives a terrific performance but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft spoken as fonda portrays him this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront whether or not this was a true story i don t know but if it isn t then why tell it using lincoln as the central character never mind though in the film lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder there s really not much to the film and as a result it seems rather empty i wanted more story and character development the film is 100 minutes long but it doesn t feel like it there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd but they seem superficial the acting is good all around but as i said fonda s performance works as a character but not abraham lincoln i just don t believe that the real lincoln was that soft spoken true he has a big voice when he needs to such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly the other performances are solid though especially alice brady as abigail clay the mother of the accused she s a nice lady who we can really feel for simple and uneducated yet very sweet we can see why lincoln wanted to help her john ford seems to think of this film as an epic and at the time of its release it probably was but even then there s just not enough material to present it as such it s a nice watch but not a classic 
__label__0 i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well o donnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands 
__label__1  flavia la monaca muslmana aka flavia the heretic of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that to a certain extent follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists set mostly in a convent and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan flavia the heretic may be referred to as a nunsploitation film however this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time as it doesn t so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism sadistic lesbian punishments etc personally i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time such as mark of the devil even though this one doesn t treat the topic of witch hunts which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period italy around 1600 after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later falvia s disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church and she joins a band of arabic scavengers one thing is for sure flavia the heretic is not for the faint hearted and neither is it for those who want happy endings director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible especially in its nasty scenes the many torture and execution scenes are extremely disturbing with skinnings spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film the violence here is never superfluous however after all this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in the film is very well made with realistic costumes fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult productions including lucio fulci s giallo masterpiece non si sevizia un paperino of 1972 she delivers another great charismatic performance here and i couldn t imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does the film has some minor inconsistencies e g why does the rigid church let bizarre cult followers into convents in the first place however it is overall amazing how realistic this film is flavia the heretic should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema this is a great exploitation flick overall though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema 7 5 10

__label__1 surprisingly well made little movie short in length at about 90 minutes for a low budget movie very well made plot is slow to unravel cast is excellent especially elizabeth van meter as the girlfriend with tourette s syndrome 
__label__0 the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing 
__label__1 the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all time favorite movies it is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless the casting couldn t have been better rex ingram made me believe in genies and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar he set the bar very high i watch this movie at least twice a year and never tire of it this film is an adventure for all ages no one too old to enjoy it the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u s was just about to enter wwii conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in casablanca and korda teamed up i believe with justin and dupree again in the four feathers great film making

__label__0 i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i re examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good then a line reading actor spoke oh dear this actor s reading sounded like some pimple faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn t read the jacket english dialog dubbed if they d casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn t going to get killed off but stay as the constant main fixture yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus 1 999 999 stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one 
__label__1 the movie was a big car commercial but who cares i went to the theater to view the shelby cobra angelina cage so i guess it was a good movie bg :)
__label__0 honestly who in god s name gave this movie an 8 1 rating i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted otherwise this movie sucks this movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film i m a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here the story and acting was the worst i ve ever seen the props including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else i m all for bad language in movies but the f bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f bomb in any movie ever the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film i d expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesn t belong on a dvd do not buy this movie do not rent this movie all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon this is valuable time that you will never get back unfortunately for me that time is lost but it s not too late for you if you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning 
__label__1 this is a very grim hard hitting even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry it s black and white photography keeps it from being dated mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted yet strangely sympathetic lead one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row it is also quite poignant 
__label__0 there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way sex in churches and other scenes that border on tasteless like the scene in the laundry room taint this movie judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done but it is a good film for trivia contests because so few people saw it 
__label__0 the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar but superior the legend of suriyothai set box office records the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in 1547 siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest pedestrian scripts and story development on film the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma gary stretch whose vengeance for this father s murderer drives him to shipwrecked captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria cindy burbridge with the consent of her father phillipe john rhys davies a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong dom hetrakul after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan yoe hassadeevichit reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat oliver pupart to take over the rule of siam yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families tong s wife and children and fernando s now firm love affair with maria with the expected consequences the acting with the exception of john rhys davies is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas but if it is visual splendor you re after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions it is just the basics that are missing grady harp
__label__1 the events of the 11th of september 2001 cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing entertainment was more or less curtailed to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson and that was it the rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and i have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we ve seen over the years and whoopi goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric david letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9 11 was haunting and dignified as for the awards new zealand was absolutely robbed fellowship of the ring went home with four minor awards while a beautiful mind undeservingly picked up most of the major prizes except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy new zealander but went to an an all american nice guy instead the only oscar awards i agreed with apart from the ones presented to fellowship were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor both correct calls 
__label__1 with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn t trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 9 10 
__label__0 without reiterating what was said above about this movie i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this film the cast location and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etc it had a vague shadow of don t look now about the storyline from the beginning a stay in different surroundings italy again to dim the heartbreak of loss or perhaps that s how i saw it so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country and i sat there and sat there and guess what nothing actually happens and i mean nothing you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous you are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it s head the eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys had great scope to take the movie in another direction the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect when the credits started to roll unexpectedly you can t help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish 
__label__0 this movie down shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd grinding gears all the way to the sappy b movie finish line the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie that is worth seeing the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you may miss it definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this bad to mediocre confusion there is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints especially the unbelievable character al i wonder if he s got a job for me in cincinnati 
__label__0 this is one strange hacked together film you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one i m not surprised there s no credits on it who would want to be associated with this film the acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over it all makes very little sense as i said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn t shot that needed to be and all the music was very ill fitting library music cheap i guess very very odd i might actually buy a dvd of it though if it could let me in on what the hell was going on and what happened to this movie 
__label__1 what can i say ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can t forget this movie you know i really don t remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don t care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika s beauty well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak s beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you 
__label__0 please help the economy spend your money elsewhere the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her that s it undetected by anyone except cuba and angie she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president cuba a deflects the assassin s bullet which then enters the back of the president s head cuba and angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great lengths to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film cuba speaks with a presidential staff member the psm comments that there was no conspiracy cuba claims there was more than one person involved the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi the cia and the nsa gosh i wonder is the psm is involved ms archer the first lady is a craptacular artist cuba can t make out a painting and she says you re too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective can anyone miss that clue 
__label__0 caught this on ifc yesterday and can t believe the positive reviews am i the only one who thought these ladies were anything but kate tells jed she could get fired because she s supposed to be a pillar of the community but puts out for him then they suddenly decide they re in love and she s so devastated over his death she doesn t go to his funeral much less tell his family the good news by the way how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power but nothing happens and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning and the less said about molly the better as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed please it s the punk s own damn fault he got turned into roadkill where s the guilt over poor gerald who gets puked on if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this movie 
__label__0 i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics and i m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for itit gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face bad guys enter the templechild sits with blank expressionbad guys chop up the monkschild sits with blank expressionbad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with go on guess you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson s wonderland ranch he d still give the same blank expression this movie would be better titled the wooden childthe title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening in fact that s the main problem and boy it s a serious one with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be it s part fantasy part martial arts part buddy movie part comedy and it s all crap
__label__0 a definite no a resounding no this movie is an absolute dud having been recommended to me by a friend very much into that sort of thing i watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed changed moved altered uplifted and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when i suddenly see the truth now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical the metaphysical physical boundaries of existence believe me i am not such a person i try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly in terms of content the only thing i found mildly interesting and informative was the bit about peptides emotions addiction and cellular receptors that was the only unifying element i could find in the documentary part of this film the rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere try to tie up and conclude to a point and what was all that stuff about native americans not being able to see the ships that columbus came in who told the authorities in this film that that was what happened in 1492 where they there too had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition the famous gorilla video for example visit the visual cognition lab at the university of illinois site there may have been a more convincing point made here however it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo jumbo as a film this wasn t one film it was two i found the documentary part mildly interesting just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about i was annoyed that their credentials weren t presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke at least initially but i found the story part of the movie with matlin in it annoying disjointed intrusive non related and downright stupid that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny it was laughable ludicrous sophomoric and stupid and i found the use of the word pollack offensive it just seemed so out of place and wrong is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group that may be okay to make a point but it didn t seem to be used that way here and in any case i don t care what the reason it offended me a pole i never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as pollack and i certainly don t like like it when others do can i watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used you betcha but again this didn t seem to be the case here it just seemed so out of place unprovocked unmitigated the acting was abysmal elaine hendrix s performance was totally unbelievable at times it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her marlee matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing perhaps she was baffled by the material i know i was if she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged up anxiety prone malcontent it just didn t seem to click but by far the world s worst was hendrix all in all i found this a disjointed poorly acted piece of clap trap 
__label__0 bonfires of the vanities is a film drenched in flop sweat i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous provocative and important yet failed so consistently across the board it is like a stand up comic who s not getting laughs but can t leave the stage the harder the film tries the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud the desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved the film achieves laugh out loud status only twice once is in the sight of geraldo rivera playing an obnoxious arrogant and amoral tv tabloid journalist which is funny only because he apparently doesn t realize he is playing himself the other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film s final big moment wherein the judge played by morgan freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is it s what your mama taught ya the pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd yet one must admit it is a noble effort it does have a good if poorly cast band of actors who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures the film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director brian depalma just loves are apparent if not particularly effective but the film which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics never arises above the level of cartoon satire requires style farce requires energy even sitcom requires timing but the best bonfires can muster is desperation in the end you don t want to laugh you just want to turn away 
__label__1 after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had 3 99 in my wallet thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie saw this and gave it ago i m glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identity brian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren t at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider man 2 the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew s name and that made me get it and no his part isn t big at all it s very short at the very end of the film it s not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but it s watchable 
__label__0 i ve now watched all four bo derek vehicles directed by her husband john all are quite terrible of course but this is certainly the pits featuring the usual flimsy plot bad scripting by the director naturally and acting not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star it deals with her losing much older husband anthony quinn she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired hemingway but who continues to appear and talk to her in fact he wants to come back in another younger body but actually does so only in the very last scene derek is lovely as always and still playing naïve especially during a muddled mid section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa quinn too is typically larger than life read hammy here but this easily constitutes his nadir besides for much of the duration he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo his replacement then is obviously a handsome looking stud who hasn t a lick of talent or even personality also featured in the cast are hollywood veterans don murray as quinn s best friend and bo s business consultant and julie newmar as quinn s guardian angel in the afterlife plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire donald trump who presumably needed this on his resume it also goes without saying that john derek was his own cinematographer on the film that the end credits are filled with useless and corny expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand and that ghosts can t do it swept the board at the 1990 razzie awards 
__label__0 i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas having reserved a special slot for it last night i sat down to watch it with my daughter aged 17 and a film studies student with chocolates of course in eager anticipation we love jane austin after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk the shaky camera shots and angles general poor cinematography direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied despondent we viewed on anne played by sally hawkins looked oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasions breaking our hard won fantasy of the moment and engaging us directly in an almost i ll find you stalking fashion poor rupert penry jones who played captain wentworth did his best with the script and direction bless him i hope they paid him well however as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall drenching him and his co actor they were nearly swept out to sea health and safety would have had a field day poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place other than mr penry jones alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head s unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott towards the long awaited end of the film captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being in contrast anne ran hyper ventilating from pillar to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told in the course of only three or four minutes without even having worked up a sweat we experienced none of anne s charms crossing the screen indeed we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain spineless opinion less anne and why someone anyone did not tell mean winging sir walter to just shut the heck up the crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment was painfully drawn out as they moved in closer anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met eww the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story filmed in some of england s finest scenery sorry jane 
__label__1 this film evil breed the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast slasher style death and plain disgusting acts of death the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn t offer much and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture 
__label__0 not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short this thing exists for one reason to have a lesbian three way there are worse reasons to exist one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character like lara croft that they make nude calenders of her you know that a soft core flick is set to explode unfortunately this is pretty pathetic especially the painfully fake sex scene between darian and misty where you can see her hand is fingering air watch this if you just can t get enough of misty or ruby who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever 
__label__1 for the first three seasons sabrina was a gem hidden away on tgif and later early school day afternoon reruns each episode had a maniac zany energy and rapid fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke melissa joan hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy particularly in her facial expressions her two aunts playing the straight men or as straight as two witches could be had great comic timing and general chemistry with hart salem as a talking cat was free to dabble in whatever mad scheme he was interested in and one could laugh and take it all in stride because he was after all a talking cat sabrina s friends rounded out the social experience at school in which also housed the typical evil cheerleader and totalitarian principal perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture e g bands of the era jerry springer archetypal human condition morality e g the importance of friendship the spirit of christmas and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the magical realm unfortunately like so many other shows throughout the age of television the show hit its peak during the first three years which coincided with sabrina attending high school starting in season four the move to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the general quality of the show particularly when the writers chose to introduce josh as harvey s rival and concocting thin excuses for aunts hilda and zelda to remain on screen as key players the final season where sabrina works at a pop culture magazine was unequivocally disappointing still in the end sabrina particularly the high school years remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it above the tiresome fare that is produced in this genre every year 
__label__0 heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas it s desperate to teach us a civics lesson and it won t stop until we ve passed the final exam fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington where they see the senate in action or inaction if you prefer have a spat with their senator eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace henry wallace a year later he was considered a near communist dupe but in 1944 he was a ok add in some truly awful musical moments a whole lot of flagwaving hooey and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters and you ve got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2 d c boogaloo drastically unfun heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes 
__label__1 this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i can t not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni i love them both their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there the husband in his brief role is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who commands his wife and children but in his own way a loving father the beginning scenes with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it isn t more renowned 
__label__0 you know you re in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives it all goes downhill from there unnecessary matrix influenced bullet time camera work pointless cuts to video game footage crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye even the zombies are boring i was hoping for at least a so bad it s good zombie movie but this one is so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again 
__label__0 this film is regarded by some as a classic i ve no idea why it is terrible to the point of being laughable the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film but so what there is no plot it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery and michael douglas is as depressing as ever my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldn t believe how bad a film can get he was right normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn t watch it but in this case i think people should as it will put every other bad film you ve seen in perspective 
__label__0 it has its merit s morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments she s so enigmatic so original is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that s making her so distant and un relatable or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary personally i d call her dysfunctional morvern is completely detaching herself disposing of her boyfriend not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain she s seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity she may as well have killed herself despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director s shots were superb the lighting and color made the film visually stunning it s really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest it s little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don t care about the characters or the film 
__label__1 i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good it s an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the u s can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie 
__label__1 i acquired this one of my all time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me away i am a massive fan of hazel o connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the will you track it s a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth this rates second best to quadrophenia which also starred phil daniels a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80 s in which i grew up the ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering baby i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing i can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack alone hazel sorry to hear about your dad darling god bless you all xx
__label__1 if you like film don t miss this one if you prefer action or horror or romance then you ll wonder what s happening everyone here is stuck in a gangster film and what happens is transcendental murder there are few similar films no doubt it will see limited release and be hard to find but the search will be worth it if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol then this is indeed a film to study you can t watch it once if you do you ll never see what s happening dark city is better joe vrs the volcano is more fun but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism or at least to think twice before shooting again 
__label__0 the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its best worst i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clichés on every level story line situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses 
__label__1 i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night i do like juliette lewis although i m indifferent to brad pitt after this viewing i have to admit he s a perfectly fine actor his character was entirely believable and i didn t think brad pitt at all unfortunately i can t say the same for david duchovny i m an x files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as i d thought it was made a few years later i like duchovny but found his character a little two dimensional here except where he s doing voice overs that part was strong seemed in character good intonation etc otherwise i kept thinking agent mulder which is a pity michelle forbes was a treat why haven t i noticed her before i ll be looking up to see what other roles she s done and seeing those asap i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis this film and natural born killers a firm favourite interesting though to see a contrast of characters in nbk she s a willing accomplice whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge early s dark side until it s thrust in her face i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly apart from duchovny s character not seeming fully formed and perhaps being washed out somewhat by pitt s it was perfect i was also pleased with the ending glad that the innocent heroes did not die yet they had to suffer first it was realistic tense disturbing if you like nbk you may well like this movie and vice versa 
__label__1 my brother and i have pokemon 4ever on dvd we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best too bad it a new pokemon didn t talk this time i ll get used to it the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control there was only one song in the ending credits called cele b r a t e performed by russell velazquez pokemon 4ever became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film 
__label__1 this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sica s most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neo realism he always dallied between that and pure good old film making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias 
__label__1 this is the second baby burlesk short to be released and probably the most popular one is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie porn that is being claimed it is just a cute little film i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the 80 s and 90 s that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a mature manner it was more provocative because they weren t dressed in diapers there s nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes just a joke i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this that is sick to me if you watch this and are bothered by it then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film all of the b b films were parodies nothing more the parodies spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language shouldn t those be more appalling i can watch those without issue but they sometimes take children s stories and turn them into filth on those parodies that is what should get under your skin not that they babified not a word i know an adult movie from 1926 because we know how pornographic those silent films were huh not to mention those forbidden hollywood pre code era films so vile and filthy they would never make such filth today note the sarcasm 
__label__1 i m a big fan of fan of film noir and this film by otto preminger easily stands as one of the best that i ve seen preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit laura gene tierney and dana andrews for an entirely different sort of crime film laura was based around love and this film is based around hate as we watch police detective mark dixon a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal a man by the name of tommy scalisi the plot is brilliantly worked and preminger excellently balances several plot points but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character the fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from and director otto preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling beating one another and their women shooting and more and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier laura which was very much set in upper class society the role of mark dixon gives dana andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career here we have a character that is difficult to like as he s so cold but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he s easy to sympathise with and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight the character development is well timed and as we ve follows this character and his motivations throughout the film everything makes sense by the end his co star is the beautiful gene tierney who isn t given as much to do in this film as she was in laura a film that made tierney its linchpin she does well with what she s got however and the lead duo s chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene she s in i can t say that this is a better film than the earlier laura that s a hard act to follow but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than preminger s earlier film the film also makes a good comparison piece for laura as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie yet it s all strangely familiar highly recommended to all 
__label__0 i don t know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site i m a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief but even if i wasn t the poor acting very poor casting sean astin as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the guy s completely generic and sub standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance sadly it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe you ll like this movie but if you re a vonnegut fan or not completely insane don t see it please 
__label__1 bertrand blier is indeed l enfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public filmed with his fave duo depardieu and dewaere and the usual dose of sex miou miou plays her typical role at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever in first les valseuses is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals those who only are satisfied with family life or simply know nothing more the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that it just let you think of all the usual things in life working for the car being bounded at work etc it s a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we re living in great job and it just makes you wish two things dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu he d better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some 
__label__0 i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie instead i based my judgments on a friend s opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy but this movie just falls flat on its face during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one and it that endeavor it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward luckily but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern not much of that in the movie the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole some parts were discontinuous altogether if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didn t do a good job the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes which were dry and dull rock s first incarnation s couple of underlings were also bland if there s one thing they did do right though they made rock seem funnier by comparison 
__label__0  spoilers below cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the year that i ve seen that is this movie is straight garbage there is so much wrong with the film you can t help but be amazed at how bad it really is this movie had so much potential to be good but ultimately made nothing of it the characters were as dumb as one can be for the entire movie you re just asking yourself why would you do that or what s your point in doing this this is how illogical and stupid the characters are we get no background into them so naturally you really don t give a rats as about their fate you could only laugh at their stupidity the slut marcy for instance was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul rider strong there was no point in that its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila ugh would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin without looking at it first why didn t bert just shoot the sick guy from the start movie would ve been over that way besides they ended up killing him anyway why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin even if they had to walk no i ll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected one a blink away from death to finally opt to walk outta there what was exactly the reasoning behind paul s attempt to fish out the body of the hermit only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus pure stupidity i swear common sense was not a friend much less an aquaintance to these idiots i don t think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie in the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for and he replied that its for the niggers in the end of the film 3 young blacks dressed in baggy clothes one of them in a du rag no less go into the store come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting then he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they re his homeboys okay what the hell was the point of that how tasteless can one be what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie i as a black man was of course offended by the initial nigger comment it was a tasteless pointless remark my question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the black kids was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier to smooth things over with black viewers by making a joke out of it well i for one did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit the whole movie was a joke a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that shouldn t be given the time of day peter jackson really thought this film was that good what film was he looking at zero out of stars if i could give it a lower rating i would please fellow imdb ers don t waste 1 1 2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a movie this is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen 
__label__1 in one of her first movies romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18 learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony kitschy and campy though surprisingly faithful to the real events this romantic piece is irresistible seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm on that front one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen but then one remembers that in 1954 austria was still under occupation by allied troops including british ones maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film 
__label__0 i thought that zombie flesh eaters 2 was quite a good horror film when a terrorist s body infected with a stolen chemical is recovered by the us military the corpse is then cremated releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island soon the infected locals turn into flesh hungry zombies and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead i did not find this film to be as good as the original film zombie flesh eaters but it was still an ok horror film with some good action i did not think that it was one of the best in the series 4 10
__label__0 this film may have been the biggest let down i ve experienced in renting movies based on imdb reviews overall i simply found this to be a second rate movie leslie cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and ma wu handles his character with cheerful competence on the other hand ma wu s makeup facial hair is so obviously phony that i simply could not take him seriously he looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for halloween complete with the 4 95 stick on beard the special effects were so so though the undead in the cellar were pretty good the tree tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick though the pov shots from the tongue s view more closely resembled sam raimi s trademark shots in the more recent evil dead trilogy the pyrotechnics were ho hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get in fact it most closely reminded me of the lost in space episode where the robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and the plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of european fairy tales there was no suspense and no plot twists in fact you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good who is bad and who is going to survive i just returned this film to netflix and then i sat down to write this review the very first thing i did was check the production date yep it says 1987 not the 1967 that i thought it might be and that pretty much sums it up the production values and fx are typical of the 1960s the plot and action seem much older as hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s out of 
__label__0 even for a tired movie model as the nature vs man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective though entertaining for reasons it was not intending it is sooooo preposterous apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites hundreds of these bites being fatal watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not so good but very bad way so many scenes just look ludicrous a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper bernie casey faking a gam leg and the list goes on and on the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls the cast for the film is not bad on paper but none of these actors seem to believe in the material poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror i hope she found a good use for the money for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense although it is quite a bad film it is watchable once for me and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities start studded actors embarrassing themselves that made for tv feel and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected really quite dreadful 
__label__1 i saw brother s shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn he shows up there because his brother has died and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother s wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives also the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait 
__label__1 hey guys i m actually in this movie i didn t even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised i played pete the main characters son it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it while filming they needed me to be in two places at once so they used my twin sister as a body double the finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine i still act and do some tv but not as much oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll review i thought the movie was okay but if i wasn t in it it wouldn t be one of my favorites i thought the acting was really good but the story line was only so so 
__label__1 i found this film to funny from the start john waters use of characters reminded of some of the down to earth characters from fellini films christina ricci has once again expanded her abilities in this film if you are looking for a fun movie without preaching i recommend this film 
__label__0 my husband and i were intrigued by the spectacle a strong willed southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the lapd the first season was must see tv for us unfortunately the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching my husband and i were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up but the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss why would a strong middle aged woman do those things the answer is she wouldn t additionally my husband and i pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy it is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family can t the script writers do something original from time to time as i mentioned we are no longer viewers we prefer shows that don t betray the characters and insult our intelligence 
__label__1 here s yet another film from the 80 s that most people just don t know exists this slow picturesque the loving shots of the montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of costner s recent open range which also starred robert duval and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can t sleep or on a listless sunday afternoon those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting the performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced glenn close robert duval and wilford brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors i especially liked how director cain who unfortunately hasn t directed anything of note since this except the first young guns gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone s personal grief we don t just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenager s girlfriend what we essentially get here is the rural mid western answer to ordinary people there s also shades of david lynch s the straight story in some of the stoic downhome mid west morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit this is one of the better and more realistic tear jerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there 
__label__1  slight spoilers way back before evangelion was made before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite gunbuster was made with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time and the famous otakon shorts or course gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up it didn t make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space opera luckily gainax decided to put it out as a six part oav direct to video series this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam and many other popular space operas for one the shows starts out pretty light with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid this makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and noriko and kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet out the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action a couple more characters are introduced and parts of noriko s past are dragged up again besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the gunbuster mankind s final hope is presented smart as writer okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit in short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her the science might not be perfect but it s presented in a pretty believable way with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes where noriko kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series the animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good the designs are retro 80s style of course but it has it s charm animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast the last episode was entirely done in black and white while it s generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter part the music is very typical space opera fair too bombastic in places very generic and definitely not worth buying it does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series he s worked on is dragon half if you think 80s anime music you will know what to expect as the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row neither aspect is ever left completely out though with the last episode in sight noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee self preservation while they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought the last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course again it fits the series gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien invasions huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is but it is done exceptionally well for a change instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed out characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon the show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided overall the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flaws 
__label__1 i was around 7 when i saw this movie first it wasn t so special then but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun a lot i think the best parts of the film are yeti s body language and the special effects also if you wanna watch this movie don t wait for a hollywood made blockbuster even this film was made from approx 1000 dollars i ve a copy of it movie and video version as well but i don t think it had been ever shown in cinemas watch it enjoy it yeti for ever :) :)
__label__0 the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes other than that this movie is a big dud we have kim basinger the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min of the movie which added nothing then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her from there this movie gets worse way worse i know its only a movie and you ve gotta go with the flow but she s got about a 5 min headstart and she can t hide or find someone to help her instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her but now she turns into one tough mofu you get the point do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type it s so illogical you ll be questioning every scene it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as the consumers 
__label__0  the domino principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you ll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream i give up how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks i hope they spent their money well 
__label__0 prom night is about a girl named donna brittany snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg 13 horror movies that haven t been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog oh my god and talking about girlish things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but i m still not done with the review the only reason to see prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills if not don t see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24 7 so not only aren t they scary but it s obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of oh my gosh it s our prom i understand it s fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i d be the first one too i m not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously don t spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a night to die for when watching the film 1 star out of 10 p s if i could give the film zero stars i would 
__label__0 the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way i m going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning i m sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor man s blade runner the movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities it makes the movie leave a pointless and non lasting impression also the weird look of the movie doesn t help much the movie is halve cgi halve real life but it s not done halve as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and 300 they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless and odd choice also considering that the character animation isn t too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn t cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn t a positive thing to say some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as i m going to do this but it s none of your concern why i want to do it than just don t say anything at all mr horus it s irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you don t care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script the actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i can t say anything negative about them the story and movie is far from original it rip offs from a lot of classic and semi classic mostly modern science fiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me a failed and uninteresting movie experiment 3 10
__label__1 it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant it captures more than the nostalgia of the time it has a real heart to it it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful a simple story is always effective when done well this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one am looking out for his next project the follow up is always the most difficut thing it s like the second album blues for most people i just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film cheers to all enjoy your cinema 
__label__0 this is possibly the most boring movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie it is slow dull and has no real plot you wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started i understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around thank god disco and three s company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers oh well just my thoughts 
__label__0 this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double dq otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in overtime kerry von erich the i c champ was wasted here and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed remember before that he never lost a match the second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights pinning the honky tonk man koko b ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna this was a foreshadowing of bret hart s singles career as he came back from two on one and almost survived the match he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was dibiase s boring feud with dusty rhodes even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since 87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way around one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov tanaka and even the warlord in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers but that just wasn t a surprise tito was i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the end this show was boring and the matches were too short the undertaker s debut was cool but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one 
__label__1 i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell but she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live lol whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie definitely a gem and totally original scott
__label__0 this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies but this movie was a disappointment the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them he doesn t really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and unless i missed something the didn t say how he managed to escape either not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the cross incident 
__label__1 usually musicals in the 1940 s were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what i m talking about a certain running lenghth very showy performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc this one is different and light years better and well worth it s nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner lost weekend gene kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes i know about american in paris and singing in the rain this one is different he really gets into his character of a sea wolf thinking at first that picking up any girl while on leave is nothing more than a lark and if you had to make up a story to get her so be it until sort of like the music man when he gets his foot caught in the door the eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal sinatra s attempt to make the story good in order to get the girl that he really and unexpectedly falls in love with you are going to have to see the movie to see what i mean besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one it s a classic buddy story nostalgia to a time when wwii was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that i can t think of right now why not a 10 near the end at nearly 2 1 2 hours starts to feel a bit long there is a small ballet number that gene kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now but overall this ones a definite winner on every level 
__label__0 other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacon s acting was pretty good but he couldn t salvage the movies lack of plot 
__label__0 whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i ve never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me 
__label__1 i think that that creator s of this film s concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received it isn t an oscar caliber film of course but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 in the theatre i don t think this is and hope it isn t a spoiler but imagine acting on your impulses doing the first thought that pops into your head saying the first words on your lips no restraint no conscious nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that as intelligent adults we know we shouldn t actually say or do if anything this film only scratches the surface it doesn t go as far as it could go in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older classics to try and cash in on today wouldn t it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level a bit further or even to explore what the original crew didn t wouldn t or couldn t deal with 20 years ago that s just my opinion anyway o 
__label__1 peter sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york or loisaida as it s known by the locals mr sollett s heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family that is typical of the different inner cities of the country mr sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents these are basically good kids the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing instead of presenting his characters as losers mr sollett shows a positive side they all have these kids are not into drugs or are stealing because they are poor had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of children that are struggling but deep down inside they are not defeated victor rasuk as victor vargas was a revelation he is a natural so is july marte her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn t want to do altagracia guzman as the grandmother is excellent she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her all in all this was an excellent picture thanks to peter sollett 
__label__1 i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasn t even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfeld s acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don t take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if you re looking for a random movie and you like woody allen i d definitely recommend it 
__label__1 most of the feedback i ve heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed a couple even saying that they think it sucked well to those people i say get some f ckin imagination and go f ck yourself this was a very entertaining flick the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwar costume looking deathbots called necroborgs eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you which then is able to control your actions due to hot wiring your nervous system unfortunately for two love seeking lonely young adults they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered is there a way to stop the transformation maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat why do the necroborgs fight one another do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty only one way to find out going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions but it turned out being a great surprise a few unanswered questions some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of from the anime feel to it to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses with a ever developing story that s interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make up effects and blood splatter this is one flick fans of bizarro horror tetsuo splatter fans should check out 8 outta 10
__label__0 w somerset maugham s of human bondage is supposed to be a english language classic if so much must have been missing from the film version here phillip s leslie howard attraction to mildred bette davis is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post breakup retelling of a relationship from the man s point of view being a family lawyer i ve heard many such accounts the man depicts himself as noble and always correct and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man indeed unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker this is an uncomfortable movie to watch phillip even indulges mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity but the real high point comes when phillip allows mildred enraged and now of dubious sanity the free run of his flat with predictable results bette davis was attractive for about five years of her life but that period didn t occur here in fact by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the baby jane character she would play thirty years later i note how howard s character is always impeccably dressed and groomed it tells me that phillip craves middle class respectability someone like that could not run from a woman with a course cockney accent fast enough phillip is for most of the movie a student such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status an english raskolnikov as it will and balanced that by allowing mildred a modicum of charm 
__label__0 this is not the video nastie but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain it is 75 a rehash of the boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason whatever that was i was initially confused as i thought that annie kelly galindo may have been a different lacey but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film fans will immediately note that they are not the same person after seeing a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address as well annie her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials head to the house and sure enough it s the same bathroom 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described of course we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered then the movie shift to a rerunning of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original notably the boogeyman is shown unlike the original sadly some of the good scenes were cut but 90 of it is there why rerun this film did they find the footage in the trash what was the purpose we ll never know and despite the psychologist telling annie she is cured we all know the bogeyman will never die 
__label__1 despite of the success in comedy or drama the turkish directors are failure in horror thriller okul d bbe are good examples for the awful horror turkish films but if you watch gen you will understand that it is a strike the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark also the special features are colorful and not cheap the soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary as a result gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey 7 10 
__label__0 i m going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the imdb to look up movies been motivated by nacho s film the abandoned to create an account and post a comment this was hands down the worst movie i ve ever seen in my entire life the plot was on the verge of non existence and none of the puzzle pieces added up in any way whatsoever the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hille s cunning and repetitive use of the f word and brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision i m disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars 
__label__0 what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres i thought i have to get the other movies this guy larroz has made i was sorry i tracked this down it is a weak attempt at an occult satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere avoid this one too much hype surrounds it not worth the effort of finding it this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres oh and the goat scene was very boring i understand that this is what carries the hype 
__label__1 remember ralph bakshi the guy that was an animator on terrytoons then on paramount cartoon studios after that he was a director on fritz the cat 1 2 and heavy traffic well this is coonskin and it s actually pretty good racist but good the movie takes place in harlem nights no duh it was a working title but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie song of the south it s about sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy a story about three guys i used to know just like you and your friends pappy s story is told in animation set against live action background photos and footage brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear voice of white and preacher fox voice of gordone decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel arriving in harlem rabbit bear and fox find that it isn t all that it s made out to be they encounter a con man named simple savior a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the cousin of black jesus and that he gives his followers the strength to kill whites in a flashy stage performance in his church savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression represented by images of john wayne elvis presley and richard nixon before asking his parishioners for donations rabbit first goes up against madigan a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them he believes they re not worth it when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs he and his cohorts ruby and bobby are led to a nightclub called the cottontail a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink madigan while under the influence of his spiked drink is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype adorned in something racist and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead then while recovering from his delirium of being drugged shoots his gun around randomly and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them rabbit bear fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up the live action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops but managing to make it out alive this movie was controversial at that time of release and was re edited by the director several times under the title street fight which is obvious since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets in fact this movie has the same subject as the documentary that caused bryanston pictures the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic texas chainsaw massacre to go out of business because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film but due to racism bryanston took over bakshi s production despite the controversy it was worth the entertainment the animation was awesome at that time the plot makes sense and it s actually funny too final verdict 9 10
__label__1 deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesn t make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you can t catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching 
__label__0 i think i ve seen worse films so i m giving this a 3 but it s a struggle to remember what they could have been possibly xtro nasty dull or possibly creep just plain dull but it is a struggle to think of something worse it s difficult to know where to start let s just say it s a poor man s under siege starring an even poorer man s jean claude van damme the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van dien i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers yes he was johnny rico if you really want to know judging from this site he s been stuck in tv movie hell casper be more selective please arghhhhh i ve just turned over and there s a half decent film on called criminal law now i m beginning to get really resentful about the last 1 5hrs 
__label__1 eddie izzard is a one in a million comic genius he goes from squirrels to wwii to stonehenge to religion to englebert humperdink and it s absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense get a copy of this now you won t regret it i give this an 11 out of 10 
__label__0 this movie was absolute torture first of all it s a whopping 4 hours long true the kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown so maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised sure didn t seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws the battle sequences were so poorly executed i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border each battle was the exact same as the previous it was so predictable this might be a spoiler the whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same cussword every time one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says no don t get a stretcher that will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies that exact same thing happens over and over and over again oh and the songs are so bad and so long the cast of the movie is too big for its own good despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed the actresses had the most miniscule roles they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same two of them were weeping synchronized it was so comical they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together the list just goes on and on i know i m still forgetting something anyways i think i have bashed the film enough that you get the picture 
__label__1 the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former but consider this short again there is nothing objective about it the film is full of action a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes to map out the world edit it restrict it limit it worse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen all seeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie 
__label__0 the only reason the norliss tapes deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast other than getting to see angie baby in a pre police woman performance there s nothing else worth seeing here the synopsis minor spoilers david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the norliss tapes a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural in the pilot episode a wealthy sculptor dies but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death we soon discover the ring itself doesn t grant immortality instead it only reanimates the sculptor s corpse allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood blue faced yellow eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven t heard since you last watched scooby doo cartoons the sculptor attacks his wife dickinson one dark night she escapes and via a mutual acquaintance contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband s uncanny reappearance on her estate so is this guy a vampire no there s no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard the sculptor doesn t drink his victims blood he collects it how don t know we only see him attacking never collecting why to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood once it s finished sargoth plans to inhabit the statue using it as his gateway into our world the final analysis the norliss tapes wasn t picked up as a series for a very good reason it was garbage as you can see from my synopsis the story is a paltry ill conceived mess the acting and dialogue offer no better this isn t even a contender for a so bad it s good award sometimes bad is just bad after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of the norliss tapes i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10 15 03 i wish i hadn t set myself up for the fall having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago i can only assume any applause you ve heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis either way they ve offered you misleading reviews of the norliss tapes pauly orchid october 17 2003
__label__1 soon americans would swarm over a darkened damaged england preparing to invade europe but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing idyllic diversion american dancing star heartthrob jerry halliday astaire on a european tour weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager burns is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton fontaine the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by and rigged for head butler keggs gardiner who s betting on lady alice s cousin reggie noble the favorite of alice s stuffy domineering aunt collier the story would have been much better as a half hour tv episode the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full length film both alice jerry appear impossibly and annoyingly clueless by the second half of the film the amusement park interlude the climax in the castle are too long begin to drag fontaine is too beautiful too dignified too quiet to be a ditzy blonde no matter how aristocratic while young footman albert watson is painfully awful but while damsel is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent the talent doesn t let us down astaire s romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes both solo with burns allen are up to par though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame gracie nearly steals the whole show as george s bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded conniving coolly self confident her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one of a kind classic this astaire s priceless scene with the madrigal singers give damsel a delightful color of naive but noble spirited americans mixing with noble but dull spirited englishmen gershwin is at the top of his game with nice work if you can get it stiff upper lip which carry the film through its weak points and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment damsel is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star it s a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again 
__label__0 this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys basketball team similar to goldie hawn s wildcats it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role and she does as about as well as the script allows i think racquel welch would have been a better choice but considering the film s apparent tv movie budget they probably couldn t afford her cathy lee does look great in every shot but we never get to see her completely nude the story is pretty predictable to say the least offering no surprises a young and lucky michael biehn has the male lead role he is the star on the team and also the love interest for cathy lee keenan wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn t think a woman should coach sports this point is brought up throughout the film and needless to say is dated ironically cathy lee doesn t put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions she doesn t do anything a male coach wouldn t do there is a funny subplot involving a tall and not so bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player sydney wicks it looks like everyone had a good time making this film but the only real reason to see it is for cathy lee crosby she s not that great an actress but she has a dazzling smile beautiful hair and a very tan body 
__label__1 i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals don t sing cute songs or even talk a major plus sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we d have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn t offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though 
__label__1 this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film it s worth a look as it s far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all it s not a reality show i m wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that which lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bent while some decry the premise i think it s really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost whisperer and medium i think it s the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earl oh and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path i d recommend it it s not as strange as twin peaks was but it s got a serious kink to it 
__label__0 claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing that the screen is cut off because there seems to be important actions going on but you cannot see them there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals i like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work i can handle deep and slow movies but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully nothing to get attached to to any of the characters because they are not worked out well enough to work out characters more is needed than just minute long face shots at least with this set of script director actors i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history and for someone who spent time in shanghai 
__label__0 although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies i find this movie to be particularly grating maybe because i m from a different era and a different country but i found crosby s continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first trite after a while and then finally annoying don t get me wrong i m not anti american whatsoever but it seemed that the english could do no right and or needed this brave oh so smart american visitor to show them the way it s a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time it s the fish who has the upper hand to be fair to both myself and the movie i have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time i watched another crosby movie last night the emperor s waltz and that too produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife who for what s it s worth is american found the in your face attitude of american crosby to be irritating one too many references to teddy roosevelt as she put it as for the premise of the movie it s unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good the scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid picture moe of the three stooges all in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it s pretty hard to sit through this movie 
__label__0 a half hearted attempt to bring elvis presley into the modern day but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo playboy magazine subplot presley is surrounded by the same old coy winking clichés a woman picks e p up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life and he doesn t seem to care dick sargent is grueling in another sidebar but don porter and rudy vallee try hard as elvis two bosses he s moonlighting you see some of the songs are quite good especially almost in love but if you want to see a looser hipper updated elvis sex comedy look elsewhere when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together there s actually a wooden board in between them get real from 
__label__1 those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money unfortunately the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently tearing his life apart there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and of course the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time the middle part is a bit dull but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie also they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it i was not disappointed 
__label__1 there is nothing not to like about moonstruck i m from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number 3 it s a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming that s amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food i ll kick you till you re dead chrissy bring me the big knife who s dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when there s nothing good to watch because it makes me happy 
__label__0 this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard but all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer as other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still haunts him for some reason not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like wonder woman and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i can t recommend it at all if it didn t take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy outside of bright future this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet 
__label__1 this movie is a classic in every sense of the word it is very entertaining and also very disturbing the acting in this movie is well done the story itself is believable suspenseful and well thought out character development is also done well the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film the villains in this movie are very threatening from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something this movie shows how a human being when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it not everyone is going to like this film there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable it is definitely worth watching this movie is a masterpiece 
__label__0 this movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors or presumed actors a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent giallio torso directed by sergio martino in 1973 two years before one of the most celebrated psycho thrillers of italian cinema and a cult movie around the world in la sanguinusa conduce la danza the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an peeping tom watching from a window of the bedroom naturally the scene in rizzo s movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino s film to put another black girl another white girl and another peeping tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo s movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all i think that such things are an offense to spectator 
__label__0 i went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about and i was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6 oscars and 7 9 rating on imdb as of today kathryn bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and i wonder why did the totally unrealistic cowboy bomb disposal man storyline mean anything to somebody that i failed see why did i keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movie about a cowboy doing brave deeds in the wild wild west infected with evil red indians but just that it was set in a different background this time was it given the oscars because the director being ex of james cameron and made it a nice underdog gossipy story for day time tv shows to munch on or was it some sort of emperor s clothes syndrome where most people realized it was junk but just couldn t say so because others didn t seem to be saying it out aloud and finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high resolution super slow mo as if to convey a deep message or something something in the lines of eod guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason and you can get the oscars for editing and directing for that if you haven t seen this yet don t waste your money on tickets wait till they run it on tv in a few years you are not going to miss much 
__label__0 this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot if there really is one and tries too damned hard to be modern ridiculous out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate and cute yawn there are too many manufactured belaboured jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close and she is normally very good sweeps through this film parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard it s a film that isn t even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct 2 had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn t it is bad 
__label__0 there s hardly anything at all to recommend this movie chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this clunker is a waste unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown a clichéd monster on the loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell so bad it s good the rest of the show is just so bad it s bad a little humor might have made this more palatable but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is a twist or two at the end but by then you won t care anymore 
__label__1 well i d heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the giallo but actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy the two have pretty much no relation in the sixties and seventies italian film makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released they ve not done that here but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film the postman always rings twice without giving the book s author james m cain so much as a credit anyway the plot focuses on gino costa a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a café where a woman named giovanna bragana works he soon learns that she s married to giuseppe a big fat annoying man whom giovanna can t stand to have even touching her he wants the pair of them to run away together but she s not so keen on the idea however fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it s based on it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics the story is as you would expect extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film but it s not a great film the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters heads there s not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what s going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason although it s not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m cain classic 
__label__1 i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive it has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward he and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts it s a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working judd is fantastic as usual as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach anyway i found the film refreshing and entertaining 
__label__0 this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black man s vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies aren t a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs i m surprised it s gotten such a high rating on imdb 
__label__0 i ve said this in other reviews without a story you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want still no one will give a damn the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco which i love and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making however it s obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned plotted film spoiler for crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing ok they have one but he s been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place conran misses the point of having a villain as far as action goes well let s see sky captain law shoots down one robot two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before dex ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and law s lack of chemistry is so right and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she only has two shots left both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one uncomically one quite funny although i saw it coming from 70 years away no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen and that s the movie s real flaw an audience doesn t identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate without that plus a good engaging story all the cg in the world won t help 
__label__1 i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business who are now still trying to become adults no more fans groupies money etc and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight it is almost like they have to begin anew this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70 s and 80 s are going through now and that s where i find the film sad and depressing but it portrays the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost in a believable way the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren outrageous and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their 50 s who have seen the rise and fall of bands people who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps in and popularity fades this is an almost perfect movie sad but in a way positive because of the whales a must see 
__label__1 although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i don t know why i think i like it because the moral of the story is television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life for those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all to ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building killing himself everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9 11 
__label__0  but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time and that takes some doing what with the likes of various lifetime efforts don t get me wrong i have nothing against cicely tyson i ve enjoyed her tremendously in other roles look at sipsey in fried green tomatoes for example but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery and chew it she does with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim tying into a christmas goose give me the classics anytime alastair sim 1951 with the exception maybe of scrooged all the others are just over the top efforts to grasp the past present or future spirit of christmas 
__label__0 it has very bad acting bad story lines bad characters you should never see this show if you see it on turn it off or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes it should have never been aired it s not great you should never see it never ever ever so now if you ever wanna watch this show please don t turn to the the cw for smallville or disney channel for hannah montana wizards of waverly place or nick for drake josh those are much better family shows so believe me on this i ve watched it before and it is honestly and i say honestly the worst show i ve ever seen and i ve seen a lot of tv so do me a favor and never watch this show 
__label__0 as the number of video nasties i ve yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when i saw it was available the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut he s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ping pong balls for eyes and that s pretty much it his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i found myself muting much of those scenes oh did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but it s not a redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got it i can t recommend this trash to anyone it s not even the good bad movie it s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true 
__label__1 if you didn t enjoy this movie either your dead or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle an excellent cast all of who gave good performances this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor despite what critics say adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor it all started with his performance in big daddy then he did a couple bad movies then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 first dates the longest yard then click and now reign over me back to the movie adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything the closest thing to family he has are a mother in law and father in law after his old college roommate cheadle ran into him he seems to turn his life around i will say no more because i do not want to ruin the movie but i strongly recommend this movie one of the best movies of 2007 
__label__1 with rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum and montage superimposition of images and vague interwoven narratives this is a very hard movie to follow apparently a man masue inoue takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife and maybe to rescue her but she s clearly mad huddled on the floor with a vacant expression much of the time and fear misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time the film maker switches to her point of view sometimes and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby or clutching at a drowned child she s tormented by something when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things showing us what mad people see and then how they react and the place is swarming with mad folks laughing hiding and in one case dancing frenetically night and day at one point the man tries to take his wife outside but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he s interrupted in another attempt to steal her away and he kills the doctor and many attendants and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud when he wakes he is relieved and mops the floor some fascinating shots of japanes life streets buildings in the 1920s 
__label__1 just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival and enjoyed it thoroughly great writing and direction excellent and believable interaction among the cast and great comic timing as well this movie touches on themes that are universal family and separation as a result i can see european asian and american audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives if all that wasn t enough this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year somebody distribute this in the usa please finally thank you maria flom it really is a great film 
__label__1 i tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted i m a professional actor and i was flabbergasted by the performances they felt totally improvisatory absolutely without affectation i could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the imdb to find this film do not miss it i see that the writer director also did a very fine film called everyday people which i enjoyed a lot the shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar this film deserves to be flown high and proudly i urge people to look it up and watch it 
__label__0 this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny what is it with the talking car with buttons that say wendy s mcdonalds m m s and skittles there was no talking car in the cartoon dr claw is supposed to be evil not handsome and charming why is rupert everet claw anyway were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes it looks like they were badly lampooning robo cop with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie you don t get a refund i m sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap after i was told the no refund policy i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget 
__label__0 ok admittedly as an orthodox woman who lives in boro park i m going to be a little biased against this film however it seemed that boaz yakin s sole purpose in making this film was orthodox bashing with our wigs modest attire and separate seating we re a pretty easy target already yakin never made it past the surface the result is a film with more holes than swiss cheese 1 yosi tells sonia off for loving him more than g d or their parents then he deliberately defies his father s order that he not go swimming because of his poor health 2 sonia flips out at her son s bris why would a hasidic woman from monsey have such a strong reaction it s hard to believe that she never attended one before let s face it even reform jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays 3 was mendel sleeping during his chosson classes he s supposed to satisfy his wife s passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street especially in the middle of the busiest street in boro park 4 sonia and mendel had to have been married for over a year and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other a little clue arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn t work out 5 if sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly she did not have to go through her lecherous brother in law there are orthodox female doctors lawyers teachers etc sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic instead of taking control of her life she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she didn t like the outcome that s not standing up to one s environment that s pandering to stereotype frankly i think she got what she deserved 
__label__0 drew barrymore plays young holly gooding who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter patrick highsmith george newbern and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her doppelganger or evil twin is out to kill her and her family this silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously even if the film makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious doppelganger is muddled with some unpleasantly dumb dialog some viewers will note that drew s character s name is drawn from audrey hepburn s role in breakfast at tiffany s and that newbern s character s name is a play on the name of famed author patricia highsmith he is actually trying to re write breakfast as a horror film believe it or not i suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film i mean writer director avi nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare after a silly villain explains everything to the audience confrontation the film goes on to submit a hideous out there climax that has to be seen to be believed this film certainly does not skimp on the gore but hey drew kills her mother in this one no i m not joking jaid barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered drew is always very watchable and very sexy in this one newbern comes off as a likable enough nice sort of guy but the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with sally kellerman an attractive veteran who s very professional in her one scene as a former nun who s started a phone sex business the film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy sordid little level 4 10
__label__0 this movie is so bad it s good in an unintentionally funny way i couldn t stop watching it i was laughing so much it s like a parody of a romantic thriller except it s not a parody alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preacher s wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you he s no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea they re in a really awful film they re playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then luke s final words to emily i was howling with laughter evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso that s probably the highlight of the film 
__label__1 being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i don t live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context this movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons a girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super cruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super annoying after having seen it you feel almost nothing you re not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe that s why i gave it 7 points it made me react in a way i never reacted before if that s good or bad is up to you 
__label__0 i read the comment of chris_m_grant from united states he wrote a fantastic documentary of 1924 this early 20th century geography of today s iraq was powerful i would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass a nation s battle for life these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures i am from this region of iran myself i am a bakhtiari chris i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment iran and irak are two different and distinct countries taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican thanks ziba
__label__1 i actually quite enjoyed this show even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up the horse broke down with tragic consequences 
__label__1 one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote do you believe in love at first site a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture further catapulting the films flawless integrity gabby aka joey played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn t even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography lol the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young handicapped kid with the speech impediment which i may add was acted to perfection james cahiil s use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm cut throat mafia this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future thats if i can find it anywhere lol 
__label__1 this movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in canada yves p pelletier i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy but knowing he was a heavy cinephile was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque i had a positive feeling about this movie hell i was right right off the bat the scenario written by pelletier himself is a bit twisted and hard to follow but in pelletier s fashion it s a one of a kind 90 minutes jack in the box loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to dangerous liaisons by laclos les aimants consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge throughout the movie you ll get the occasion to find out who s who and who s writing to who on that goddam fridge which pops up in an interesting love affair great storyline great photography great quotations of other movies should we ask more for a first movie 
__label__0 i was previously unaware that in the early 1990 s devry university or was it itt tech added film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian my friend and i rented the original 1980 boogeyman on my netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the dvd do not waste your time with this movie awful awful awful the filmmaker adds 2 main character s a woman and her therapist the woman has been having dreams about the boogeyman and his victim s from the first film over 50 of this film is stock from the original movie the rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator these scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow they would make angela lansbury look 25 years old so to recap awful don t watch this movie 
__label__1 i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode collections or when sci fi would re run the episodes however when sci fi would host the re runs they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn t repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase 
__label__1  possible spoilers i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron ely is just right as doc cool calm almost always in control and with an occasional twinkle in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i don t know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring do many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark which i don t think is fair the difference in budget is astounding raiders must have at least 10 times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the sousa music is catchy love that theme song every time i watch the film i end up humming the theme for days the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it 7 out of 10 doc savage doc savage thank the lord he s here 
__label__1 i have to agree with cal 37 it s a great movie specially for the family kelly linch is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course jim belushi has earned his strips but want i really liked was the piano song if you re a musician or not watch this movie just for that you ll know which it is you re nobody till somebody loves you written by russ morgan larry stock and james cavanaughso have fun watchingsee ya nelson
__label__1 a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool it s all thrills and spills as the ex spy has to restart his career just as he s getting some serious r r cataloguing butterflies how british is that trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle upon tyne to liverpool via ullswater he s just been thrown out of mi5 or something and she you guessed it is on the run wrongly accused of murder there s seedy docks rolling lake district hills sheep country pubs coppers getting lost waterfalls a bunch of amateur cyclists rooftop chases and lots of chinamen don t ask and it s all very hitchcocky and hannayesque and a smashing example of british noir 
__label__0 i m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i m thinking matrix i m thinking bladerunner i m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we ll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact :(
__label__0 jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy and we love him for it he has the ability to make mediocre comedies ala ace ventura and turn them into decent comedic outings or in the case of liar liar make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas he was excellent in both man on the moon and the truman show the guy is remarkable then comes bruce almighty an ideal vehicle for carrey and a premise that should have worked carrey after complaining about god and how his life stinks is enabled with god s powers however the script is pure recycled garbage now no matter how bad a script is carrey s improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects only some of which are amusing carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless he seems more like a 5 year yearning for our attention wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny when it s really just annoying i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on friends and she was superb in last year s the good girl she too has a gift for comedy but with the script as linear as it is she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend she comes across as nagging grumpy and there is no chemistry between the two stars bruce almighty should have been a comedy that works but it doesn t even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it s making fun of religion a few minor giggles his internet is yehweh but instead it s just turned into a comedic superpower comedy not to mention that it s tone shifts from silly to heavy handed and even black comedy at times the movie fails on nearly every level that s not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs but it s close any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it s laughs has problems but hey if you find pee jokes funny go for it 
__label__1 in this swimming pool this pond there are water lilies and there are frogs frogs sit on water lilies the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship marie pauline acquart is a water lily a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine adele haenel a frog the captain of her team floraine s teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer s mindset of conformity and discipline but floraine has a secret the bombshell has a bombshell which naissance des pieuvres reveals to the audience visually before she confides in marie floraine has never gone as they say all the way with a boy at a party we see a double image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make up in a bathroom mirror lolita is a fata morgana marie gets to know floraine s double while her imitation breaks the water lily s heart while the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance s sake she gets chummy with the water lily when no one s looking in the film s most startling scene the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation floraine wants boys to like her but she doesn t like boys seemingly but it s more important to the frog that she s popular when the water lily finally kisses the frog the frog remains a frog the frog can t transform into a water lily or a princess because the water lily lost the frog s respect after their lips unlock floraine tells marie see it s easy which is the frog s way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite of passage without any strings attached floraine s beauty is a burden she carries the weight of meeting boy s expectations florence uses marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet the other water lily the other frog marie s best friend anne louise blachere and floraine s frustrated boy toy francois warren jacobs just like any water lily and frog have a parasitic relationship too while floraine uses marie for love francois uses anne for sex but that s life that s the treachery of growing up in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself at a mcdonalds the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog s afterglow physical beauty is a currency marie gets to call the shots because anne although far from being ugly is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comments on marie s flat chest but the tadpole marie thinks she s better than anne better than a water lily points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat teenaged girls can be brutal to each other later in the final shot naissance des pieuvres suggests that marie has a double too and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near future if it not already has teenaged girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no boy could match 
__label__0 if he wanted to be accurate he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free not sucker free i ve lived in sf my entire life and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did everything was over dramatized and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ie his warriors jersey not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or 9ers gear instead he fitted them in some cheesy made up sf or oakland jerseys that aren t even sold around here hp has no bowling alleys black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china s olympic team nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops further while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission all that was shown was some white dude and a self proclaimed 100 west coast boriqua this is not new york puerto ricans here are few and far between and the latinos in the mission are very very different from the one that was shown here who was without a doubt from ny also hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs fillmore sunnydale lakeview etc this film could ve been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with 
__label__0 this is available on a drive in double feature from dark sky films and since i just had finished up barracuda i watched this too this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor and try on chinese style clothes at a shop but then we see some aztec dancers and all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn t have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch them it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot and where did she get it so in flashback we go back to find out and how did they know she had this coin hard to say really now back in the day when these two women were 10 years old they were out with their sisters and their sister s boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they tow this young boy back to his home dock only to have his grandpa come out invite the young uns up for herbal tea with granny but not everyone has the tea todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when they re away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it herbal tea but the girls and todd did leave the island but now they re returning escorted by their captors and they re there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before there also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since there s only three it doesn t take long and there s even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability they re borderline hilarious the hillbilly type family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden who appeared in many films and tv shows the action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like southern california so what the hell is this i m not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh 4 out of 10 very bizarre 
__label__1 this movie started slowly then gained momentum towards the middle however the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak the second part really got interesting but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending playing football in the yard really could it get any more sappy and maudlin now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s i won t make any great efforts to tune into that one if it s anything like the 60s 
__label__0 awful awful awful a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make once again i m amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don t have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good i wonder if she has seen this watch this at your peril the boredom may kill you 
__label__1 five years on from the tenko survivors returning home and from marion s double edged well that s that it s now 1950 reunion time the gang s all here marion bea ulrica kate dorothy christina dominica and latecomers maggie and alice the story that unfolds is a beaut as perfectly written and acted and as thought provoking and moving as the original series all the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here from marion s family to joss s health centre everything has changed in five years and not everything has changed for the best a trip to dominica s plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge of the seat tension there s a real sense of tragedy and disaster as once again fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives dominica finally shows her true colours and there are some shout at the telly moments of drama lush location filming in singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends it s such a shame that this really is the end i could watch it all over again perfection 
__label__1 the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performances across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever the true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america s most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined 
__label__1 i don t have much to add to what has been said before but it s very much a film of it s time and the first and likely only time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids the warner s gave the boys plenty of help from director ray enright and an a budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors at every turn we get one of those gem performances from real pros they are too many to list but it seems like just about everybody on the warner s lot sans the very biggest stars walk through this picture see if you can spot john ridgely the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in gunga din he s something to watch and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since dead end my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like city for conquest hooray for warners 
__label__0 no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie it s just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction students fist fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue the watts riots with a cast of ugh 10 dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look alike with the most annoying smile since mr sardonicus noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service silly giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of shindig sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business and who wrote this compelling dialog i m going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair i think i found someone to buy stick s woody these people are animals these people are my family as the shirelles sing mama said oh brother what a mess this is like a reefer madness of the 60 s except it s not even funny 
__label__1 i ve bought the feast of all saints and it s not truly a horrible movie but a lot of things could have been better it had a lot of historical value played out by very talented actress actors and it s not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable there were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing but i wouldn t say that the entire movie was horrible once you think about that capturing 1800 s new orleans and making something out of it it pretty hard and much harder to get actors who can strongly signify those parts but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color were mostly light skinned africans not very universal in casting others who weren t light skinned one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue despite many creoles are color conscious rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense could have been more thought out the actors did a great job the script could have better written and overall i found the performances were very believable 
__label__1 i m from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for that this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7 10 that s pretty decent i must admit that it s a very well put together movie and that s why i m puzzled this is the only film made by this director how come he didn t make lots of films after this rather good one someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha anyway i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please ;)
__label__0 i feel like i ve just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldn t stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and i m neither puritanical nor humorless i don t try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a sheltered life but i am ashamed of myself and i m sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject matter sewers the way my own tribe does it doesn t have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism 
__label__1 i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time i got into the series very late season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents dvr digital video recorder box while i was house sitting for the weekend it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer and boy was i hooked i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i ve ever spent i watched the first three seasons in three weeks that s 72 forty minute episodes i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i m going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america the dvr is set and you can bet i ll be chomping at the bit 
__label__1 i don t understand the low 5 7 rating on this film it s a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil down to the locale savannah the acting is strong and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branagh s southern accent famke jansen is great robert duval is effective in a small part and embeth davitz is the bomb great full nude scene of her too the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed 
__label__0 bathebo you big dope this is the worst piece of crap i ve seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible oooooo the toilet is flushing by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet 1992 doesn t seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like 1952 i mean its horrible please don t waste your time on the drivel scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made 
__label__1 this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like most movies show jesus as being effeminate lobotomized or tortured this jesus laughed played and was serious when it was necessary this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to not the usually hollywood version the movie took some liberties attempting to fill in the blanks but the fillers didn t seem impossible or even improbable one thing i might argue was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus death not that the jewish authorities were against the idea it seemed that the movie was researched well one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called mark it is believed that mark or john mark was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked mark 14 51 i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate even in spirit was much as possible 
__label__0  it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and let s not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen s bergman pretensions allen s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i don t get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspense horror films in robin wood s view it s a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that 
__label__1 it ran from 1959 1973 its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50 s psychedelic 60 s and remained popular in the 70 s i remember repeats of this series it was a successful combination of all its elements from stories cast and productions that made it exceptional lorne green had his defining iconic character from this series its appeal was across generations all members of the family could enjoy this it balanced morality with violence humour with seriousness a cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact the shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance 
__label__1 there s something compelling and strangely believable about this episode from the very beginning an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours kirk spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown except for an elderly librarian the librarian s polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet s past kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate frozen waste the intercutting between the two stories and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled with return to the present an unknown chance while the minutes are counting down to the planet s explosion imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series which concluded one episode later this has to be one of the best of the whole series especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall 
__label__0 no comment stupid movie acting average or worse screenplay no sense at all skip it 
__label__0 to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story it s set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta young s she s on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husband s plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and they re not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hot water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds there s now a law against selling an example of her repartee be careful farrell it s too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but don t expect her to be given a dramatic moment the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is 
__label__0 a stale misfits in the army saga which half heartedly attempts to be both surreal the foreign subtitles and vulgar the flatulence gags but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor none of them followed very successfully barbara bach the bond girl from the spy who loved me has only two or three brief scenes what a waste 1 2 
__label__0 first of all i ain t american or middle eastern second of all i don t have a religion the closest thing to a religion i have are sports and movies henceforth i believe i would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias most of these short films are an utter disgrace this dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by some barbaric and uncivilized morons instead most of what i saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points examples 1 ken loach s segment sure we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001 two wrongs don t make a right whatever this film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent chilean english accent 2 most disturbing is youssef chahine s segment it is obvious that he has trouble with logic he justified the murders due to america being a democracy and because some americans voted the politicians in power then all americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the middle east helloooo is this guy for real some americans don t even vote some americans don t even know where the middle east is some don t even know what religion is practiced there and majority don t know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes mr chahine the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic the innocent victims in the twin towers came from around the world the murdered firefighters rescuers office workers by standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics and yet we are not allowed to go about our lives because some people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics 3 the israeli segment showed their own bombed victims another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda sometimes it is not about you some people always think about the me me me sometimes it is about other people 4 idrissa ouedraogo s segment is a joke and another political point scorer they obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty blah blah blah this movie denigrates the memory of sept 11th 2001 victims the best thing for it is the trash can 
__label__0 after a series of power outages on a remote island zoo genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island man the sci fi channel has made some bad original movies but i think this might possibly be their worst so far this badly written and directed jurassic park rip off offers all the usual clichés mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are expendable losses characters walking down long dark hallways alone brain dead teen characters who s only function in the film is to die a horrible death etc and unsurprisingly no suspense whatsoever the special effects are atrocious the puppet heads in close ups of the title beasties are bad enough looking like stiff plush dolls but the cgi which makes the computer generated dinosaurs in walking with dinosaurs look life like by comparison are just downright awful there s some gore but most of it looks pretty unconvincing oh and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things i ve seen in years i couldn t even laugh it was so bad don t waste your time this one is just downright bad 2 10 oh and here s some interesting trivia for you this film borrowed music cues from the 2003 sci fi film alien hunter which was far superior to this piece of crap 
__label__1 this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered clothes and music might have changed over time but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up to dateness and especially this movie does the job pretty well of course it is cheesy at times but very touching as well jodie foster s performance is striking and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies don t miss this one 
__label__1  or type on a computer keyboard they d probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms no matter how menacing without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you ll detect the elephant people are faring less well today 
__label__1 despite having 6 different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably well it was filmed in england nowhere near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit can t you understand it it remains a favourite of many people 
__label__0 let me first say i watched this movie around midnight and usually there only is trash around this hour but this movie broke the recordfirst of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy yet he gets to f ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop talks to a girl and then you see them f cksecondly there are loads of sex scenes and in many of them there is no nudity at all i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say fast put your clothes on so we can f ck thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash
__label__0 this movie is absolutely pointless one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange this one may be one of the worst though no story crappy special effects shot in 4 3 or even worse cropped on dvd just avoid it 
__label__1 this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre mixture with ingredients of the action horror romantic comedygenre some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the world s best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended 
__label__0 while santa claus conquers the martians is usually cited as one of the worse films ever made this mexican made film from 1959 is so bad it makes sccm look like it s a wonderful life you have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking perhaps they meant it as a third world allegory about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption nah they just weren t very good the same production company made an even more disturbing version of little red riding hood in which the wolf s obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia perhaps this was the inspiration for freeway back to santa claus instead of the north pole jolly old saint nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit shades of mst3k instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice the result is like an orwellian outer space sweat shop it s enough to turn you off christmas forever this and other low rent mexican children s films were dubbed in english and widely distributed in the u s in the early 1960s no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in american history the baby boomers who were forced to endure these family films as children would be all too eager to turn revolutionary 
__label__0 literally every aspect of this science fiction low budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors contemporaries and those to follow bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect attack of the sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering smilodon cats for an attraction the cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats special effects wise the film is about an average achievement given its budget the sabretooths are portrayed through poor cgi amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an up close detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the cgi is better concealed their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful just as you d expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind this is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock the plot and characters are just as horrendous we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt and take it very very seriously even so much as to trespass on private property tamper with security systems and steal why are they taking a simple game so seriously did i miss something was there money involved or were they sent to do it i don t know i could barely follow the film but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it even so they went too far for normal attack of the sabretooth is a very poor film even for a low budget sci fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example it will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through and keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so it s not suppose to be comical 
__label__0 deep shock plays out like a tv movie a whole cast of commercial quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with i checked out the movie because of the creature i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos and right off the bat i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie the actors i expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point the music was typical not thought out action symphonic music i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini sub design the movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set you re watching the story unfold in but there isn t much of a story here anyways this movie gets a 3 10 stars imo the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it kinda lame even lamer is the tagged on love relationship between two of the characters that you don t see coming chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors careers off the bench and into a video don t bother 
__label__1 i d waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it there are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work this and the constantly gripping and interesting script with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it give the film a real solid backbone add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner it has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and splattery also the characters of marcus the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times and give a far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole i d really recommend this to serious horror buffs 
__label__1 this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partner s grandson was given it he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it and me luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the cruelties spoken and unspoken but it was accurate i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms ambulances lcc in the right colour white and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades i couldn t fault any of this from my memories and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war torn london was also sharply presented i re lived 1939 40 and my own evacuation from london with this production i know jack gold s work of course and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half uttered value judgements of those years it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaw s acting career and of gold s direction and deserves to be better known it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends 
__label__0 i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies but my god this was the worst movie i have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything the plot follows a group of teen cliche s on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island however when the group arrives all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers the clan set s off on a mission through a zombie infested forest during this crusade they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clips from the hotd video game and sloppy matrix esque camera rotations one of the character s even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others why not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled i m supposed to feel sorry for this guy to sum it all up there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and i m sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh t could easily cover the costs it took to make it grade f
__label__0 my friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end it was just so boring and unoriginal not even the hot girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching everything was just predicable and annoying the acting was at times good but more times bad the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend the more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen you know what fat ugly kid i m talking about the plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies ok it is a good idea but thats all this movie had overall this movie can only be watched if by your self to save any abuse from your friends or if you have absolutely nothing better to do 
__label__0 the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet when it s retrieved one of the crew members is ill one is alive and the other two are missing what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member while on mars the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug eyed monsters oddly while the sets were pretty good the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film plus in an odd attempt at realism the production used a process called cinemagic unfortunately this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed it was that bad despite all the cheese the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel for lovers of the genre it s well worth seeing for others you may just find the whole thing rather silly see for yourself and decide while by today s standards this isn t an especially good sci fi film compared with the films being made at the time it stacks up pretty well ps when you watch the film pay careful attention to dr tremayne he looks like the spitting image of dr quest from the jonny quest cartoon plus he sounds and acts a lot like him too 
__label__1 outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between dads authority and their hopes and dreams the period is captured the bakelite light swithes the georgian floorpan the picture rails the wall paper the short skirts the cheeky lads the mini van shiny modern mangles the location is captured a wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape walls of local stone community freedom but there is much much more childhood happiness sensuality pride values freedom authority rebellion violence in the deepest sense love struggle puberty naivety morality trust faith deceit machismo manners maturity loss poverty sacrifice horror acceptence revelation comedy and parenthood are all there and in no particular order this film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever the fact that some of these aren t tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill the story and the direction if there s anything bad about this film it s that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end maybe i missunderstand the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it maybe the film is trying to send even that message too well worth doing what is the film trying to say kids parents were young too parents struggle too everyone makes mistakes everyone learns things change struggle can end happily parents don t try too hard try to remember that your support is the key to their well being it sounds simplistic doesn t it sometimes the film feels like that too but it s then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered the film is a classic not the problems themsleves

__label__1 this movie took me by complete surprise i watched it 2 or 3 times i really liked this film there were many truths this movie brought up i love all the characters in this film as well this movie makes a lot of sense because as society becomes more advance what does the culture loose not to sound preachy i can really relate to this movie from my child hood and loosing apart of my life that will never come back or ever been the same this film is on my top 5 movies i have ever watched there is just such a raw truth that i feel when i watch the movie and its not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face the creators of this film did a great job and i enjoyed this movie very much this movie may not be for every one but if you have an open mind i think you will love it

__label__1 doghi is a wonderful movie and renuka daftardar is excellent so is uttara baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles along with kairee its an example of marathi cinema at its best there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in these scenes probably emerge from the film maker s political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it but apart from such minor quibbles its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend sumitra bhave s concern and humanism shines through 
__label__0 martin weisz who directed the solid rohtenburg will be taking the heat with wes craven for another shabby the hills have eyes 2 the memory of the legendary original which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake in name only a bunch of national guardsmen and women are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants one by one the weekend soldiers are picked off that s it there is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene but there is precious little else to get excited about the film s heroes are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants a far cry from craven s original family mostly resemble brian thompson from cobra coupled with some creatures stan winston had left over from the wrong turn shoot much of the action takes place in caves ala the descent and is well shot by sam mccurdy a laughable aspect is wes and jonathan craven s addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like leatherface in hooper s original chainsaw weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle but he s not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations not a fan unfortunately 
__label__0 the movie was ok not bad not good just ok if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far sadly fast and furious 2 also stunk but i d rather see this than ff2 if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you personally i d wait for hbo or blockbuster :)
__label__0 users who have rated this movie so highly simply can t have seen enough good films to compare it with have they all been brainwashed i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie from the first bu is just a chase film we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another and another and another and another do you see a pattern emerging there is virtually no time wasted on plot character development or boring old reality if you haven t see the other two bourne films you re pretty lost if you have you only wish you were lost somewhere a long way from a cinema paul greengrass s dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character he runs he jumps he punches he gets blown up he clears tall buildings yada yada yada above all he survives he survives like a plastic action man survives which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension so he drives off a building so what he ll survive yawn there s a girl thrown into the mix because bourne s love interest died in a previous incarnation but she s just decor i ve seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet bourne s own journey of literal self discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn t know from the first movie he was turned into a killing machine big deal he finds out his true identity so what it doesn t have any emotional resonance when it comes the twist ending is telegraphed and weak oh dear the more i think about this film the more i hate it i ve already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment i d better end now before the slide continues i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller the bourne ultimatum is neither it s a loud tedious series of flashy edits ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence the idea that it shows the way to the bond franchise is utter crap casino royale blows it out of the water 
__label__0 i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie its kinda of a mini porno it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there s spots in the movie for and there s even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 i want be watching it again at all the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie 
__label__1 i am amazed that movies like this can still be made i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on washington charismatic and intense as ever plays creasy a washed up ex counter terrorist agent who s taken to the bottle once he s assigned to protect young pita dakota fanning in mexico city his emotional and redemptive arc is jump started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide inevitably pita is kidnapped by thugs and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his character s teddy bear clutching catalyst yes he has become a man on fire you must see this movie 
__label__0 what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie unfortunately with disjointed storytelling frustrating plot holes and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever let s start with the good stuff comedy acting and special effects from the get go this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky the opening scene the monster s origin is campy and quick paying homage the the classic environmental disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters the pacing is fast which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action with in the course of 10 minutes you get the why where and how of the beast and are ready for action in this the movie delivers after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his precocious little girl kind grandfather and talented sister aunt and of course the monster the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work the monster it s self looks great alien yet familiar kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you see it s strings even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd slipping on surfaces crushing and eating those in it s path when the monster s path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie s appeal begins to unravel following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity plot lines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random as for the comedy let me say this i m willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation however as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years still here i d like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white guy that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren t spoiler for example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning a new character is introduced a brother and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder this competition is at it s core funny two brothers who dislike each other so much they even compete at a funeral it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy this subtle slap stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl end spoiler then come the plot holes there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end finding out an obstacle isn t an obstacle can be a good thing for a character but you d expect some comment to that nature instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti climax when problems just aren t there anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start so i ask you why even bring it up in the first place this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other of course introducing new and greater problems is a time tested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation not in this movie instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained 20 of the way and in the end the parts never converge to complete the whole again i m willing to accept that a lot of this might be cultural maybe its in korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy maybe it s normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every page but never finishes one maybe it s ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves 
__label__0 the only film i ve ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and i m really cheap but my brain couldn t stand any more of the dreck being piled on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged from the beginning to the end this film offends worse it ain t funny it wasn t funny then and it sure ain t funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy it s juvenile really sophomoric script and ideas began an era which continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film sexual olympics what high school kid hasn t thought of that the beginning of the end 
__label__0 ram gopal verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director he had done a remake reworking of godfather with sarkar and succeeded tremendously ditto for lolita which he made as nishaabd sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most unfortunately he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake the acting ranged from decent to very good with amitabh bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain babban the songs were awful and forgettable the mehbooba mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video the worst part was the pacing and the dialogues which were forgettable watching the movie in a theatre i found myself waiting for the intermission and then for the ending some viewers were wise not to wait and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film ultimately one of the worst movies made by ram gopal verma 
__label__0 this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can t believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can t tell me this wasn t the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don t watch this junk 
__label__0 i have never seen a movie as bad as this it is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is not funny if you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 if it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100 
__label__0 this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he s noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but he s hardly in the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they re is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they re turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there s the bloody standoff no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton s lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel 
__label__0 just as its a mad mad mad mad world is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made this one is at the very bottom of course i could be wrong not having seen saving silverman in other words it s a lame lame lame lame comedy rating 1 2 out of 
__label__1 i liked this movie a lot i rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an evening it turned out a particularly satisfying experience some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values it manages on both counts the leads are all good but especially the guy who stars also wrote and produced the movie i ve never seen any of these actors before but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lot the script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it i think you wont be disappointed to watch this 
__label__1 i loved this movie the characters were people that you could feel for the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together the most touching scene however was the young couple at his great grandfather s house i laughed in parts cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie in fact i ve re watched it about 5 times a definite must see for total romantics 
__label__0 it s a bad movie it seems like there is only 5 police in hk they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chan s movie all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other what a funny movie in the movie it s like all the good guys died without a reason they story line of the movie also sucks the story jump here and there and bored people but if you wanted to see a bloody movie i think this is only a ok type of movie i think u s made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
__label__0 dahmer a young confused man dahmer a confusing movie granted i had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesn t explain why i got so bored by this flick its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there s no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie the inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time we never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer s dreaming the entire thing but you know he isn t since it sbased on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it but what happened it s not easy to tell i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie ididn t like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended 
__label__0 i grew up b 1965 watching and loving the thunderbirds all my mates at school watched we played thunderbirds before school during lunch and after school we all wanted to be virgil or scott no one wanted to be alan counting down from 5 became an art form i took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child how bitterly disappointing the only high point was the snappy theme tune not that it could compare with the original score of the thunderbirds thankfully early saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series gerry anderson and his wife created jonatha frakes should hand in his directors chair his version was completely hopeless a waste of film utter rubbish a cgi remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with homo sapiens subsp sapiens was a huge error of judgment 
__label__1 simple story why say more it nails it s premise world war 3 kills all or most of the human race and we re viewing 2 of the survivors the message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place distilled down to representatives from each side we see they have everything to come together for security finding resources food shelter etc survival love at the end they ve decided to pool their resources she finally does so they will survive simple story expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape we see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable in the early 60s no one had seen such stuff i give it a 10 
__label__1 reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown but when i watched it i could not stop laughing it has officially become my new favourite movie i don t know what all the hate here is about maybe it s because a movie of this kind has never really been around before i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead but there will be a lot of supporting male characters this one was almost all women with the exception of seth meyers justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett and it worked all of the actresses delivered very funny performances especially missi pyle from a quirky and lovable script the charm of this film to me seems to be in its subtle feminist message accepting who you are female success in the public sphere the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles light hearted though it is each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more fun conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all female cast and lack of a big name actor to get the studios behind it and i have to agree everyone i ve recommended this film to has loved it and i think it s a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn t been widely accepted and successful i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female centred comedy 
__label__1 i think the weighted average for this film is too low i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places my wife says it passes the danielle steele test superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell 
__label__1 world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time the historical research is virtually flawless even after a quarter century it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2 an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war i highly recommend it as a learning experience 
__label__1 there should be a sub genre in the western called the robert mitchum western mitchum s brilliant idiosyncratic usually undervalued westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches and bring an elegiac world weariness more familiar from the films of sam peckinpah man with the gun is one of his best directed by orson welles protege richard wilson it is a stark monochrome beauty full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence as mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army mitchum s regression from soft spoken stranger to deranged murderer with a host of dark emotions in between is a marvel of expressive physical acting 
__label__0 just finished watching can t say i was impressed it starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears not only do you recognize them from the band lordi but they are seriously malplaced in the movie doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80 s as for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole but there is no clear story on why and what is happening the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess with all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they aren t so the movie gets cred for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on stage monster aliases scarier 
__label__1 and that s why historic biographic movies are so important to all of us moreover when they are so well done like this one before i saw the young victoria i knew a few things about queen victoria but in the end i got much more knowledge about it emily blunt is simply great as victoria who would guess that and she probably will get a nomination at this years oscar s personally i m cheering for her for technical issues i am pleased to say that is a very successful production with wonderful art direction set decoration and of course like it was expected to be a terrific periodic costume design the one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen but foremost incredible woman and mother bravo 9 out of 10 
__label__1 paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made dave it s the same story not as funny though paul related to me this morning about the scene were sammy davis sings the new national anthem of parador he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas three planes car ride to the set etc he was beat he could hardly stand had to use a cane he was staying in a trailer about the size of my bathroom he didn t know he could do it then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras paid 7 bucks he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours he was magnificent then nearly collapsed paul is a great guy though very liberal a real talent 
__label__1  it wasn t me it was er my twin brother rupert bobby says to dugan when confronted about being over at sally s place i have used this line dozens of times over the years no one has yet to believe it though this movie is one of the all time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability steven oliver was perfect for the part of dugan so much so that he was in 1978 s malibu beach as the same character not nearly as much screen time though nobody calls dugan a turd is another line for the ages this classic film was definitely worth the price of admission 
__label__0 i ll be blunt and to the point this film is not good at all the film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing amanda peet has proven that she can act as she was a high point of the whole nine yards so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole however the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny if you can forget about how underpar the production quality is and if you find smut jokes funny then you should be all right and for those of you who can t get off your pedestal thats your choice my inner child hasen t died and i laughed a fair bit even then only a 3 out of ten because as a movie it really does stink 
__label__0 being a slasher film aficionado i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise s own design now i m assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp it s good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that s about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth campy requires bad acting but come on pamela springsteen as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i chuckled but it was few and far between ultimately sac ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if you re looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on 
__label__0 hooper is not funny not fasted paced not romantic and non informative there is no real drama you would think that a movie about the world s greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn t seem real no character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time
__label__0 i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares i don t remember much of the plot and i think that s because there wasn t much of one to remember they didn t even use the hotel to it s fullest potential the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and i m using that term loosly scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings 
__label__1 this movie makes me want to fall in love all over again i am naming my next daughter adelaide just so that someone who sings like ol blue eyes can swoon her one day and feel the butterflies i felt hearing it sung and it wasn t even to me i give it a 9 10
__label__0 worst film ever this is a statement that people here on imdb often throw around whether it s an uwe boll movie bad classics like manos the hands of fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from michael bay people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they re posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world i envy these people because they re blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes there are films out there so bad so hideous so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad ladies and gentlemen i present to you ben and arthur an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it s a lot like a violent car crash you know it s awful but you can t stop looking at it the brainchild of self proclaimed hollywood actor director and may i add beached whale sam mraovich this film is legendarily terrible let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was mr mraovich not only directed this film he wrote it produced it executive produced it scored it edited it and then finally starred in it this is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is everything in this film fails on an epic level the acting is the worst you will ever witness the plot is the most ridiculous the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard i m aware i ve gone on a bit of a tangent here but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel but the truth is it wasn t even shot on film it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust don t get me wrong i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting for example as much as i disliked it the blair witch project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film ben and arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with hollywoods finest actors it would still suck the plot is that atrocious and the characters are even worse one of the main characters arthur who is portrayed by non other than sam mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film you ll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing apparently mr mraovich forgot that we re supposed to root for the hero i don t want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you ll experience watching this film which i urge you not to pay for so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie in one cut we hear one of the main characters say how they know a good lawyer and will give him a call the shot fades out then fades back in and this him they spoke of earlier is actually a woman quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think the second is simple seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to vermont we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area i ve never been to vermont personally but i m certain you won t find any palm trees there imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still won t fully prepare you for ben and arthur imagine the absolute worst film you ve seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won t be on the same level as ben and arthur this film is really that bad however we should be glad in a way films like this are a true rarity they give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters simply because we ll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we ll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this the real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered and it is called ben and arthur 
__label__0 drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter ego all over town and it s really starting to become a pain in the butt after dee rents a flat from a hack writer her encounters with the other drew become more frequent writer dude feels that it s his responsibility to snap the real drew out of her stupor so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time not very interesting and even less scary but drew is sexy as usual especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger yeah drew that s hot best scene just might be where drew stabs her real life mom jaid with a big kitchen knife hmmm and how was your day 
__label__0  sky captain and the world of tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say gilligan s island or the scooby doo cartoons it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all 
__label__0 this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these i e they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja vu and too few surprises 
__label__1 this is a lovely spirit restoring movie from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right the quiet joy of this film doesn t stale after repeated viewings josie lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format 
__label__0 this has to be the worst piece of garbage i ve seen in a while heath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish i d known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deer in the headlights look about him i can t say i agree rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn t wait to get off the set i m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite cliche ridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didn t the last 10 15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that s not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say i ll bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was i may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly wasn t free it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back 
__label__1 bear in mind any film let alone documentary which asserts any kind of truth will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless those of you who are already masters of psychology film and captains of the soul will no doubt find this movie redundant after all you already know everything there is to know congrats for those of us in the minority like myself i found the perverts guide to cinmea mostly brilliant and worth watching for those interested in movies psychology and modern philosophy a little like scott mclouds understanding comics director sophie fiennes inter grates slovene philosopher psychologist and social critic slavoj zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses the cover is an image from the birds zizek takes a boat out to re create the shot lacanian psycho analysis does not necessarily scream an evening of great fun but it is if you like movies that is having some knowledge of lacanian psycho analysis helps symbolic real and imaginary are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first but the scenes which zizek selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me a very abstract subject in fact it s probably better to have a familiarity with the films he s discussing than with the terminology he uses which becomes clearer as the film goes on why i love this film isn t because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about lacan but shows in a very practical and clever manner where film and psychology and by default philosophy meet why is the sound of music kinda fascistic why is short cuts about more than just class and alienation why do the birds attack in the birds what is there to learn about the mind from alien resurrection what does the planet of solaris want what does psycho and the marx brothers have to do with each other and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after movie well zizek has some ideas the role of the voice in both the excorcist and star wars revenge of the sith is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity i begin to wonder at one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children jokingly it seems but anyway it s a fascinating documentary which anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant something more than was literally stated should make an attempt to see and anyone interested in slavoj zizek this is a must as well much less dry than reality of the virtual and more direct than zizek two other pseudo docs about the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism as he is being dubbed in the english speaking world the perverts guide to cinema is not about the role of sex in cinema zizek claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art because it teaches how to desire and not what to desire and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema it s about finding the cinema in reality and how important and exciting that can be hard to find and a bit long but well worth the trouble one of the most stimulating movie watching experiences i ve ever had 
__label__0 to die for 1989 was just another d t v feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that there s no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l a looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they re so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting not recommended by me because i didn t like it nuff said 
__label__1 the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie johnson s acting i really like the ending however i was disappointed that this movie didn t delve deeper into achilles s and athena s relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other 
__label__0 seriously the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind this show isn t funny it isn t clever it isn t original it s just a steaming pile of bull crap let me start with the characters the characters are all one dimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard the voice acting could ve been better then there s the animation my god it hurts my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too pointy too bright and too candy coated then there s the humor or lack thereof it s completely idiotic they just take these b grade jokes that aren t even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me and finally last and least the music it s just plain annoying it sounds like it was composed on a child s computer and generates no emotion whatsoever i wish there was a score lower than 1 i really do this show seriously needs to be canceled it s a show i try to avoid like the plague whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off if you ve never watched this show then don t watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama 
__label__0 melissa s sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she s just discovering her sexuality with boys but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic 80 s slasher film it s up to the local town sheriff dan burke bo hopkins the wild bunch and his annoying mystery loving goody two shoes daughter marci dana kimmell friday the 13th part 3 to get to the bottom of these killings this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it s 80 s slasher brethren it doesn t hurt that alesia has a great body i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i m not overly perverted on the downside the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary a grating theme some that is used a bit too often and an ending that is a tad anti climatic but the good outweigh the bad barely give this a rent but i wouldn t buy it eye candy aleisa shirley shows her tits bush and ass my grade c code red dvd extras an intro by star aleisa shirley and director of intruder scott spiegel both director s cut theatrical version of the film audio conversation with star shirley and director jim sotos interview with shirley sotos bo hopkins still gallery theatrical trailer for this film and trailers for nightmare stunt rock rituals balalaika conspiracy
__label__1 it s rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that isn t incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie eg big fat greek wedding me myself irene there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie nothing unpalatably profane all around it was a cute movie with likable characters i thought the ending was a little abrupt it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish the acting left a little to be desired but was made up for by the pace of the story if i d known it was a farrelly brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie good for them i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films 
__label__1 i liked this movie cute and funny i found this film to be a good family film the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty word sorry to say that to the yankee s fans i recommend this picture for the entire family of course with your typical love comedy movie there s a long moment in the movie with i m in love and what do i do but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments the movie show s some moments of how the red sox nation in fenway park how the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand 
__label__1 as romantic comedies go this was a cute and winning one i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better but that is not a huge tripping point but amanda detmer and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever these are two of my favorite actors and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads i hope to see them cast in more projects soon overall this movie won t change your life but is is sweet warm and winning not a bad thing to be at all 
__label__0 i saw this movie twice i can t believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie i m also a movie theatre director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty images what most of romanians don t know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers pintilie should stop making movies i don t really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we ve got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn t anymore a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu :)
__label__0  spoilers some people claim that natural born killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence but this contention ignores the actual content of the film oliver stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination instead he lends them justification the movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt engaging in vicious stereotyping stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures dumb rednecks broken english speaking immigrants lazy fat people the one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype of course they befriend the old hallucinogen using american indian because they re trendy dude let s make him an admirable character fat chinese clerks and hicks are uncool so let s make it seem like the deserve to die instead of twisted hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds their rampage makes them happier and more in love mickey and mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people justice is mocked the police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal ugly and scowling compared to the gq murderers again this is not in the media reports within the film but in the reality in the film there is no nuance or subtlety in the film just overblown performances and visuals the film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence the proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed the film s message is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real life results the clever message is nowhere to be seen 
__label__0 joe don baker he was great in walking tall and had a good bit part in goldeneye but here in final justice all hope is gone the dark side has won as with most of humanity my main experience with this one was on mst3k and what an experience it was mike and the robots dig their claws deep into baker s ample flesh and skewer this flick completely it s obvious they were just beginning with mitchell on their anti joe don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme it makes for a funny experience though there are plenty of choice riffs my favorites john rhys davies for sale it s meatloaf texas ranger none of them are sponge worthy why was she wearing her prom dress to bed and my favorite son of a what what was he the son of son of a preacher man by itself final justice is as joe don puts it in the movie a big fat nada but here it actually has some entertainment value you get a chance catch this version of final justice two stars for final justice ten for the mst3k version only oh and try not to visit malta when joe don s in town 
__label__0 film version of sandra bernhard s one woman off broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say she s scathingly honest and that may be true but she s also shrill with an unapologetic in your face bravado that isn t well suited to a film in this genre she doesn t want to make nice and she s certainly not out to make friends and that s always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co wrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of sandra s in house audiences looking completely bored a feeling many real viewers will most likely share 1 2 from 
__label__1 in the immortal shaun of the dead we are introduced to a london where the slackers and the high and mighty alike are forced to battle flesh eating reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family at the end of the film it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour fido presents us with an epilogue to shaun set in 1950 s america in a hilariously witty and original what if movie the film is set post zombie apocalypse for a change after the terrors of the zombie wars ended by the creation of the zomcon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs every town in the world is fenced off from the wild zone the once fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left overs from the apocalyptic wars the idyllic town of willard is your typical pristine 50 s suburbia with one small difference social status is measured by a family s amount of domesticated zombies unfortunately the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever due to their patriarch bill s fear of the reanimated dead timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life until the day that helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours the zombie earns timmy s love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies and the two form a bond to rival the classic boy and his dog cliché a boy and his zombie timmy names his pet fido and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prison like routine bill has put them in but when fido s domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly mrs henderson the robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved fido a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all star cast including the matrix s carrie anne moss as helen robinson and billy connelly as fido fido is a zom com for the ages with some rather twisted subplots for example the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other and a poignant commentary on 50 s suburbia and the zombie genre the film manages to bring out the worst and the best in its characters while still enabling you to care for them fido is by far one of the best dark comedies i ve ever seen one of the best films that i ve seen in a long time and the best zom com since the incredible shaun of the dead 
__label__0 based on tom wolfe s satirical novel that was praised by all i have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs either melanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film this will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten 3
__label__0 dreary schlocky just plain dreadful and awful let s be honest when you sit down to watch something called the double d avenger you aren t expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts you don t get really either of these in the video the story as it consistent with most of these types is inane kitten natividad runs a local pub finds out she has breast cancer flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super human abilities giver returns and fights dressed as the double d avenger a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition as stories go i have seen a lot worse but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous the action sequences lack zip drive motivation and are tissue thin the acting isn t even properly campy and the dialog is the pits nothing and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy handed boob references all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it but they all fall way short kitten haji and raven de la croix are all quite older still lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older campy caricatures of their former selves instead they look so lame and desperate more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities there are some other lovely ladies but you really do not see much of anything pg 13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this the material the actresses and director are all tired tiresome and dated and again not funny it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me not that he was good at all mind you but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr sci fi himself forrest j ackerman play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie other than that this is a complete bust now how is that for another tired dreadful trite pun 
__label__1 this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it s kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute not just to see 
__label__1 when people think of downtown chicago they think of walter payton ditka and da bears ryne sandberg the white sox breaking the curse in 2005 or the immortal michael jordan and his six championships and finals mvp s with the chicago bulls rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of chicago the ghettos the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the 1970 s one of television s most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was good times which i remember vaguely as a small child on cbs and i enjoy regularly now on tv land good times was another norman lear classic the producer that gave us the jeffersons the best african american sitcom of all time and all in the family the greatest show of all time good times brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects and did so with charm well written and thoughtful plots and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by esther rolle and john amos the children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular janet jackson in her early years and ralph carter as florida and james evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet the eldest of the children j j played by jimmy walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief his emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties j j gets annoying and it is a credit to the often nasty james evans amos that he never tells j j to get his own life get a job and get out of the house j j is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status two classic episodes of good times was the one where the janet jackson character is running a fever of 104 and florida evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can t afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn t want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to the other episode is the one where james evans can t afford the rent a paltry low 104 a month the evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks being thrown out of the projects with no where to go florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family but the government doesn t consider her family poor because they have over 4 200 in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line james and the kids want to hustle for the money but florida is a person of great moral character and doesn t want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is in the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water good times a classic show from the 1970 s is about keeping you re head above water in a cruel world james and florida evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare i was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the 70s in its first airing on cbs but i really enjoy the reruns on tv land in 2006 good times is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day 
__label__1 in the citadel film series book the films of gene kelly anchors aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical i sure can t do better than that it s such an important film in both the careers of gene kelly and frank sinatra kathryn grayson didn t do too badly with this either louis b mayer had lent gene kelly out to columbia where harry cohn had an inspiration to let kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it cover girl became a classic so if mayer didn t learn a lesson producer joe pasternak did and allowed kelly artistic control when anchors aweigh was finished fred astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance the main number everyone talks about with gene kelly here is the dance with jerry mouse originally kelly wanted to do the number with walt disney s mickey mouse but disney wasn t lending mickey out to nobody mickey would have to wait until who framed roger rabbit to do an outside film not to worry because mgm had it s own animated rodent one half the team of tom and jerry kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did fred astaire for the next dozen years these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren t up to snuff it was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity kelly for mgm astaire for mgm and any number of other studios in anchors aweigh kelly got sinatra to dance a bit in fact frank sinatra always gave credit to gene kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both burt lancaster and montgomery clift for their help in earning him is oscar for from here to eternity when frank sinatra had half of his contract bought from rko by mgm he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own he d become friends with the songwriting team of jule styne and sammy cahn in his autobiography sammy cahn tells about how sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film louis b mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing one of my favorite sinatra numbers comes from anchors aweigh i fall in love too easily frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty hollywood bowl it s sinatra at his best with jule styne and later with jimmy van heusen sammy cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in frank sinatra s mouth than any other person they were lifetime friends and cahn always credited sinatra with this milestone boost in his career on a bet styne and cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale they proved it in anchors aweigh when kathryn grayson put her soprano to work on all of a sudden my heart sings she also did some classical numbers here singing in fact is the basis of the plot two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with kathryn grayson and her orphaned nephew dean stockwell trying to fix her up with sinatra kelly says he can get her an audition with jose iturbi they spend the film trying to accomplish just that my only disappointment in anchors aweigh was that pamela britton who plays the waitress brooklyn never got a number herself she had gotten rave reviews from her performance as meg brockie in brigadoon on broadway and that s what brought her to hollywood i have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in mgm s vaults it might still be anchors aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren t made any more all that creative talent was under contract to metro goldwyn mayer if you had to pay market value for it the cost might retire some third world country s debt but the film results would be extraordinary 
__label__0 deathstalker is directed by john watson and it stars rick hill who is some kind of body builder and famous of that if i have understood right the plot follows as deathstalker hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lord s cave he meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to tolkien and of course conan the barbarian this is a rip off of huge success of conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies there are no many cinematic merits in this film couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of hill females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists the fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special and all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this this tries to be as great as conan but fails pretty miserably as i said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else this belongs to the category it s so bad it s great deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film i appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course if bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you don t understand enjoyably bad films then stay away and if somebody can t stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well there is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an r rating otherwise this could be some safe pg family film 4 10
__label__1 as a sequel this is not a bad movie i actually liked it better than the 1st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me as i thought it just looked too low budget but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic this movie has more dry one liners than the original which is a good thing in my opinion i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense which the 1st one did not have in my view it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don t seem to flow like the rest of the movie overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel my rating for return to cabin by the lake is 7 10 
__label__0 as a kid my friends and i all believed that gymkata was the most violent bloody movie ever made i m not sure who started that rumor it was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren t allowed to see it for one reason or other years after gymkata was released it became a perennial late night cable movie and as a result i ve been able to make up for lost time i must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times and i can always spot it from 1 2 seconds of screen time however aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts the bad dubbing the stiff dialog and the outrageously difficult story line the film has some things going for it with all that s bad about the movie visually the sound is actually pretty entertaining never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume the canned kung fu sounds are cheeky but the slowed and pitched down music and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird the chase through the city of demented blood thirsty villagers isn t really tense as much as it is irritating and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train wreck a little fun could it be headed for cult classic status where is mst3k when we need it 
__label__1 the best thing about this movie is that it is fun it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the blithe innocent pecker played appealingly by edward furlong who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life other great characters include pecker s friend matt he s a thief but he s really a nice guy pecker s sister chrissy who is addicted to sugar and pecker s catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the virgin mary in her room the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy handed about it there is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of common people of sliding into a kind of reverse holier than thou but pecker avoids these traps allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun 
__label__0 i m not a huge freddy krueger fan but that doesn t mean that i don t like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies i think that robert is a very good actor nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does but no offense robert this movie sucked the acting is terrible the plot is really weak and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that s even worth watching sometimes sequels can be better than the first such as the friday the 13th franchise i thought the remake was the best in the series but this isn t one of those movies the original was good the 2nd in my opinion was better the 3rd was okay but i haven t seen the others whatever you do don t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap 
__label__1 a bit slow somehow like a sofia coppola movie but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life the music is perfect and the acting is amazing the camera works beautifully also i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities 
__label__1 on 24 october 1955 the hard work geologist of the hadley oil company mitch wayne rock hudson meets the executive secretary lucy moore lauren bacall in the office of her boss bill ryan in new york and invites her to go to a conference with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon kyle hadley robert stack on the way of the meeting he confesses that they had traveled from houston to new york to satisfy the wish of the reckless kyle who is his best friend since their childhood of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to kyle s father jasper hadley robert keith mitch and kyle immediately fall in love for lucy and kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress lucy then he opens his heart and proposes lucy they get married and travel to acapulco and the insecure kyle stops drinking meanwhile kyle s sister marylee dorothy malone is an easy woman and has a non corresponded crush on mitch that sees her as a sister one year later kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again the jealous marylee poisons kyle telling that his wife and mitch are having a love affair when lucy finds that she is pregnant kyle believes that the baby belongs to mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy written on the wind is an overrated melodramatic soap opera with artificial characters and situations there are at least two great movies with characters with drinking problem the lost weekend 1945 with stunning performance of ray milland and days of wine and roses 1962 with awesome performance of jack lemmon robert stack has a reasonable performance and his character s motives for drinking are shallow and clichés in the end the forgettable written on the wind is entertaining only and never a feature to be nominated to the oscar my vote is seven title brazil palavras ao vento words in the wind 
__label__0 i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie jeez this movie was predictable and pretty boring the acting was below average most of the time especially by mckenna i haven t seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone badass in a movie oh man this movie was a letdown i also read somewhere this might be a cult classic i know there are followers of the director but this movie was just a average piece of film the script was lame for the most part the acting was lame this movie was lame oh and pray for the guy that used to be in cheers he looks really bad the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes 4 10
__label__1 the story centers around barry mckenzie who must go to england if he wishes to claim his inheritance being about the grossest aussie shearer ever to set foot outside this great nation of ours there is something of a culture clash and much fun and games ensue the songs of barry mckenzie barry crocker are highlights 
__label__1 a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock imitation many called it a ripoff with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera work and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted for tv tapes the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a pre nypd dennis franz who has hair here the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it s apparent who the killer is it s still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women 
__label__1 i rented the film i don t think it got a theatrical release here out expecting the worse the previews made the film look awful i was in fact very surprised it was well worth watching it was loosely scripted almost like an ensemble piece of film it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing it is flawed mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning comedy effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer he is also an easy target springer could have made citizen kane and it would be proclaimed the worst film ever made i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film 
__label__1 ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different entities however that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of stream of consciousness i think this is the best film they could have made with the material and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts i recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining 
__label__0 with the runaway success of god s army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasn t at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the singles ward however is not telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the singles ward is in many ways very similar to the 80s comedy ferris bueller s day off however the similarities end there while ferris bueller was funny original and well acted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the singles ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you ve probably heard a million times before the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is amaturish at best in addition if you re not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you won t get hardly anything at all whereas god s army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it it s just not that funny 
__label__1 this was the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it doesnt glorify their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light i give this movie a 10 it has great actors realistic scenes and excellent writers 
__label__1 if you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales the pretty woman variety love story here is a beautiful film in which a japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic dispassionate life when he falls in love with dancing wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving 
__label__0 everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that s not the only reason why this movie is really bad it s actually so bad that i m not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark if the first episode of les visiteurs was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it clavier is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like lemercier because she s replacing her but that s grotesque lemercier is lemercier robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she s not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played lemercier playing her role as for the story it s just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and déjà vu no really there s no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment 2 10
__label__0 this film was a disaster from start to finish interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st leonard or as some old testament prophet many of the performances are forgettable over interpretations especially rufus martha wainright s or bland under achievements only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonard s own versions by using a little restraint annoying little pseudo avant garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of leonard cohen s comments making it harder to hear what s being said and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments an attempt at added gravitas for the real thing see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988 
__label__1 ya that is what i think sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better without i love having c j and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together when john was still around i really didn t laugh as much as i do now it is too bad that no more are being made i don t think because i would love to see some new material my favorite character must be rory poor rory is almost always left out it is always about bridget or carrie what about rory honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it i almost guarantee you will laugh well even chuckle 
__label__1 after a big tip of the hat to spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if you didn t rent it anyway the my peanuts and a gangster s life videos are worth the three bucks alone 
__label__0 i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writer director i could not have been more disappointed by this move the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr hopkins falls into this category of all the movies i have ever seen in my 50 years this is absolutely the worst movie ever please do us all a favor mr hopkins and stick to acting which you are excellent at and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would

__label__0 0 s christian slater tara reid stephen dorff frank c turner mathew walker will sanderson directed by uwe boll based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action packed nail biter sadly he doesn t succeed instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line and some basic relativity of what s going on in the dark and the light the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters even though they did look cool and the feedings were well a little lame honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made my final rating 0 10 
__label__1 this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance the show of shows is pretty gigantic vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces an oriental number and on and on it lumbers grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound it is far too long but among it s delirious delights are the awesome singin in the bathtub number created on a scale of which the qe2 architects would be proud beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty nick lucas and the never ending grand finale in two color color which is all set to the song lady luck so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en ter tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort row after row of doll characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor i kid you not there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes unable to move for days i imagine during production whilst this katzenjammer of toy box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions and so should you and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill it is all so demented 
__label__1 an absolutely brilliant film jiri trnka the master of puppet animation confronts totalitarianism in this his final film it would be banned by the communist czechoslovakian government at the time despite taking the country s highest animation award in this dark and entertaining short film an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant he happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose all of a sudden he here s a knock at the door and in comes this giant omnipotent hand that tries to force the artist to make statues in it s likeness the artist resists as best he can but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts by the hand to force him to conform he becomes brainwashed an intellectual zombie at this point the hand attaches strings to the artist puts him in a cage and uses him to make hand statues all the while glorifying the artist s work and awarding him with medals and honours the artist s inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination and enables him escape his prison whether it be literal or in his mind and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand he shuts himself in thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high hoping it is out of the reach of the hand and it ends up falling on his head killing him the artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation all because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand s strings once dead the hand paints the artist as a great person a national hero unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered trnka s condemnation of totalitarian society and their lack of right for free expression is dark damning and an amazingly animated it is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire and would perhaps even listen to that was obviously not acceptable an amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have and still quite relevant today for many parts of the world from the us to the middle east a must see and definite 10 out of 10 talk about going out with a bang 
__label__0 another british cinema flag waver real garbage on offer here once again i cannot understand and i am british why this over the top patriotic nonsense was ever made eight years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended other commenter s here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage this is extremely poorly observed the archive footage is in abundance model aircraft swing from wires in the action scenes like so many children s kites in the wind the usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole malta event guinness must have his worst acting performance ever the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area ealing made many great movies this clearly is not one of them they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot 
__label__1 this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny entertaining and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right i recommend this movie to anyone of any age 
__label__0 unspeakably discombobulated turkey a mix of anti nazi musical pre war americana and agatha christie whodunit spoof with one big big problem it s deadly unfunny besides the single digit i q plot and dialog the most amazing aspect of lady is the berserk casting gene wilder star and co writer tries hard at it all he plays a romantic lead with his looks and his age he and woody allen should start a club for clueless mirrorless ageing comedians and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart and tries to sing and dance and succeeds in none a looong shot from his good old days with mel brooks for a while i thought i was having a myopia fit because everybody in the movie keeps saying cherry jones is this pretty hot chick and that michael cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion the guy who plays claire bloom s male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies mike starr s over the top acting as the most incompetent phoniest cop you ever saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted at least i hope both stars payed their bills back home and subsequently fired their agents with this flop no wonder acting prodigy sukowa returned to germany after she saw what hollywood had in store for her if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director study this one otherwise stay away 1 10
__label__1 this movie is a lot of fun the actors really make the movie go the distance though without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie worth the price of admission just for that all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed comedy people of all ages will enjoy it my parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones good date movie great for some escapism deserves an a hope it does well at the box office 
__label__0 chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so annoying unless you believe in psychics re incarnation and the other hocus pocus which this promotes big time the re cycling of souls they call it here puh leeze this story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait it s also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr cybill shepherd ryan o neal and mary stuart masterson at least it s a pretty tame film language wise that s about the only redeeming quality of this movie 
__label__0 this film makes american pie a sophisticated movie no further comment needed humor is cheap dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward every cliché is used several times without any original twist and far the worst the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope it s so sad 
__label__1 like i said at the top four stars just aren t enough it s one of the best films i ve ever seen in my almost 17 years of life for the people that don t really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span even if i haven t seen all his films yet i d have to say that this is spielberg at his peak it s pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple don t come along too often cause i think all of us are in desperate need of first class motion picture entertainment in these hard times movies like this are more than just movies they re pieces of art that need to be appreciated more the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars even best picture of the year and didn t get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasn t even nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that year the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people if only movies were still this good 
__label__1 first off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a james bond effect what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006 it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 dr no 1962 being the second while in golden eye the first film with pierce brosnan judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male m so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double 0 aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older this is more or less a poetic license to thrill we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained no the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago in the 1960 s communicators were fantasy now we call them cell phones and there were sliding levers instead of buttons omg do you think 400 years from now they would have perfected rogaine for jean luc picard so please let s give the producers some leeway but to try and make things a bit consistent let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica if that is the case where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space well what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship loaded with human looking cylons wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one they colonized it found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a ragtag fleet to search for the legendary caprica only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet which they colonized to become the humans who eventually invented the cylons time paradox of course which came first the chicken or the road who cares it s fraking entertaining 
__label__1 with the death of george nader on 4 february 2002 i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over 40 years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many differing images one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp riding his famed rocket sled at the point where he was often referred to as the fastest man alive 
__label__0 during the early 1980 s kurt thomas was something of a hero in the united states inevitably men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that i have no idea what thomas was paid to make this film but i would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture the film is obviously derived from enter the dragon as are most martial arts pictures only instead of a real martial art they concoct an absurd new martial art accurately described by one critic as a cross between kung fu and break dancing a gymnast thomas of course is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress yet every room has a prop that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies of course he fights his way to the lead villain and of course they have a fancy dancy fight with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film there are touches which nostalgic types will like particularly the mullet haircuts of thomas and many of the male co stars have but the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against kurt thomas who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set 
__label__0 man i really find it hard to believe that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess having seen the first two episodes thus far i think i can safely say this show isn t going to be on my must see list it s just got so many things working against it none of the actors cast are particularly good anna paquin as the lead character sookie is just awful i remember her being better in a lot of other things i ve seen her in so maybe it s just the writing she s not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly the actor who plays bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof the other actors do their best but with the cliché characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it s a tough job tara is an absolute misery to watch rutina wesley absolutely murders the accent it s like nails on a chalkboard bad almost as awful is nelsan ellis it s difficult to understand what he s even saying sometimes both his character as well as tara s also seem a bit racist to me i don t know having a character say whycome on an hbo show that isn t the wire just seems a bit odd rounding out the cast so far are sookie s doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting i ve seen in william sanderson as the sheriff the story seems to be meandering towards it s destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested the romance stuff is very dark shadow sy although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old dark shadows episodes times about ten at times it seemed so campy to me that i just have to assume it was intended to be but unlike a show such as buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show i m not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other hbo shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving jason stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless about the only nice thing i can really think to say about this mess is that i liked the opening title sequence hbo has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately i hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air 
__label__1 it s amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow stargate sg1 is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with star trek as the kings of sci fi following on from the 1994 feature film stargate this series sees stargate command a military science organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore sg1 is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack o neill and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal c who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa uld a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods the top notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o neill who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye michael shanks as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed amanda tapping as carter has perfected the balance between depicting her character s femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal c who is able to depict the character s emotions with subtlety and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between o neill and jackson guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn t bore viewers sg1 also excels in humour from o neill s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death it isn t just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show overall 
__label__1  no spoilers being a david lynch film one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do but it is a very straight story as the title might hint don t except to be caught in the usual lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i e lost highway it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect it s innovative because it so not lynch but maybe that is lynch he likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from lynch himself being a very avantgarde director he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn t give it to them that would be crafty the pace of the film is slow i would almost say lawn mower speed don t expect an action orgy but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film look carefully for those small details that lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life and listen to badalamenti s score and the main theme that really animates the iowa and wisconsin landscapes shown frequently farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film making him one of the most likeable ol men ever depicted on film he doesn t have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts his cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an oscar nomination need i say that his weak health in this film wasn t acted he was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete that knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to farnsworth all of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done one could ask for homilies that aren t that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn t ruin the overall picture being that it is a memorable motion picture 9 10 
__label__0 i had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying ss new movie on dvd attack force now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this a pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me i bought this film thinking i d see cool martial arts and shoot em up did i hell segal is old and bloated the plot was ludicrous even by ss standards and to cap it all off segal s acting such as it was to start with is exceptionally dire so dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded nothing like him either ss cant act no more a moot point of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn t record the sound properly the voice would flick back and forth between mr whisper segal and the man who does voice overs for honda adverts plot wise isn t the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one nothing new there the usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of h5n1 avian flu utter garbage 1 10this has been a public health warning 
__label__1 karen sarah michelle gellar an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semi catatonic woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker yoko yoko maki disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in emma s home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goes maybe it s a delayed influence from the success of m night shyamalan s films but slower paced understated horror films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek 2005 the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise 2005 the pacing tends to kill the film i didn t like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek but this is still a very good film it earns a 9 out of 10 from me the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with ju on 2000 in particular it s extremely close to the first half of ju on the grudge aka ju on 3 from 2003 two as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isn t so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare director takashi shimizu also the director of the five japanese entries in the ju on series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewers scares how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to film making although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the ju on series traditionally american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster a more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isn t yet accepted by the mainstream in the u s however even if you re not used to it it s worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic ju on 3 good cinematography subtle production design touches check out gellar s clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of emma s house when gellar first approaches and beautifully effective horror material even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture it s interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery thriller territory with a here s what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a 10 out of 10 now that i ve said all of the above let me finish with a mini rant it s not that i m anti remake but it is ridiculous that u s distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption the original versions of these films should just be playing in u s theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for non white or foreign actors yes the grudge is a fine film but ultimately i d rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror films not just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etc at my multiplex in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more cost effective to do this as 1 you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and 2 you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions 
__label__1 this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn now that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as it s issues are still widely available it s funny the acting is great and it raises serious curious questions i can t fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot grrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but aren t we all 
__label__0 why did i waste 1 5 hours of my life watching this why was this film even made why am i even commenting on this film one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n t for everybody i cannot figure out who this movie is for maybe after dropping a hit of acid somebody somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it it is incoherent it isn t experimental it s plain and simple garbage the film follows no plot line whatsoever just when you think you have something well you don t i think the ending brought some finality to the film no pun intended the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on i don t think i put a spoiler in here not that it would matter this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom 
__label__0 absolutely unwatchable lowest quality film making this film makes show girls look good the acting is insufferable the cinematography gives a bad name to amateurism no wonder it went right to video and bypassed the theaters this film wasn t released it escaped 
__label__1 i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian chris rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid 50 s white mans body he doesn t realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before he listens to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community 
__label__0  some possible spoilers i m not too sure what dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick they probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences mostly families to see it in droves well it seemed to work for the opening weekend it made 26 mil roughly and has made 38 1 mil total an estimation for this weekend but i think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did when i saw and they spread the word this is one majorly lame movie apart from the animation everything else mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old the movie is only about 80 mins long but it feels like a three hour epic a few sticking points for me are well the irritating narration is one of them and it s so obviously written at one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared up pops the narrator the voice of the talented matt damon to clear up any misconceptions which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets another one is the constant pop up of bryan adams songs now i m a fan of his music i think he s good but come on did dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8 9 of his songs throughout such a short movie i certainly couldn t finally and here s a spoiler a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary no less she the horse then falls into a raging river spirit the focus of the movie tries to save her but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well now i know this is a kids movie but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable to sum up this is a really lame movie i m not saying kids won t enjoy it but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year out of 4 stars 
__label__0 dr seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat big mistake myers proves he can t act in this film he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve the kids in this movie are all right somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories never tweak with the original story bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it the film sure does look tacky sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word mildly funny at least the grinch had spunk and the film was actually good this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting was mike myers even in this movie actually and another thing the fish what is with that stupid fish first time you see him he s an actual fish next time you see him he s all animated and talking but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough this film is a total off target wreck good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke i m surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke that was good so please if you have the choice watch the grinch instead of this mess 
__label__1 i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into killers for their country and put into the war and the after effects once they return home it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vets this film is powerful moving emotional and thought provoking it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends the best film of the festival so far 
__label__0 i don t know what it is about donald sutherland s acting style or vocal style but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex he s just i don t know thick somnambulistic on meds weird that said i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release and frankly i don t remember it ending anything like that a bad ending too because nothing gets tied off what about the dead husband the annoying child and was the kid dubbed the scotland yard and military pursuers i would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all not just the big panoramic pull away and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband even if she was trying to allay needle s suspicions to protect her kid she could always have had a headache that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable 
__label__1  pecker is a young unknown photographer from baltimore who becomes a big star in the public the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements it s a typical topic of john waters baltimore based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the american way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown edward furlong of terminator 2 fame plays pecker supported by christina ricchi photographer cindy sherman legendary patricia hearst and water s long time actress mink stole although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can t compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of water s brilliant serial mom it s still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish pecker is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene media hypes middle class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it recommended 
__label__0 i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldn t make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though it s like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy excruciatingly painful if you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriously if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake 
__label__0 there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is the pagemaster i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out but this time i found that the special effects are quite good the plot is just the neverending story with a creativity endectomy but it s an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye candy the animation is amazing and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm i m giving it a grade of three as i would have given it a two just for parody value if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story wise 
__label__0 it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group t a t u coincidence i don t think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous you know the recipe the other actors well i just don t know what their role is supposed to be most of them are well known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors e g mihaela radulescu so to summarize it girl band tatty desperate publicity needing actors a non existing plot the occasion to use bad language in order to shock love sick too bad the idea was good though and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title 
__label__1 jake speed is a film that lacks one thing a charismatic lead unfortunately that s something that really taints the entire movie and it s a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting if derivative premise although it s genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy the film actually plays a little more like romancing the stone albeit in reverse it s not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character who happens to chronicle his own adventures leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventures when a young woman goes missing in paris her sister margaret played by the appealing karin kopins gets embroiled with pulp hero jake speed wayne crawford and his sidekick dennis dennis christopher who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the clutches of two brothers the deliciously evil sid john hurt and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice roy london that s the plot it s not labyrinthine and it s not complicated but the story that it tells doesn t require great depth the action sequences are appealing to begin with and it s certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their paces whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions and there are certainly some quite funny lines however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome this however may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne crawford s performance it becomes harder to really care what happens now i don t know if he was stretching himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether he s simply not a good actor as i haven t seen him in much else but he never really convinces as a roguish mixture of doc savage indiana jones and jack colton this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well karen kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake unfortunately it never convinces dennis christopher is perfect as the archetypal sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp relish almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman he strides about his few scenes growling in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film sid is no moriarty he is presented as jake s nemesis from a number of his previous adventures books but he is always fun to watch jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as night of the comet a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand and almost succeeds but misses which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television series i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good 
__label__0 a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do that being stealing from farms and killing prey until a trio of farmers decide they ve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved they are of course out foxed at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land the film version and i use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely so kudos to them they ll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book 
__label__1 this movie is funny and suitable for any age it is definitely family type entertainment the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid western town of big bean illinois where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement pre invasion of the decade is the new and only exit ramp from the interstate the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians but these martians are totally inept despite being well equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons including one set on eradicating the martians too the martians dead pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them leave earth j j anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines watch this movie for laugher and entertainment thought provoking it isn t but subtle and enjoyable it is

__label__1 i liked it just that i liked it not like the animated series i love it the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didn t like it that much there s too much people talking about bruce being so cold but if this is around 5 years later anybody in a crime fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isn t a flaw batgirl was awesome she really fit there as there isn t more dick grayson as a robin batman needed a good teammate not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child but heres what didn t work the new artwork it isn t horrible but to me it does nt work in a series like batman this is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon the joker isn t a bad design but i still like the past joker but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond return of the joker so this joker isn t near as good the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice my favorite character harley quinn im in love for her they put an awesome episode for her mad love to me the best episode of this series here we finally know how she turned harley quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker but too short this is how it was to be all the series but in general i didn t like how she made harley in this series in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get punched she say nonsenses she make flaws c mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her and here they put ridiculous like i said the only episode where i don t think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper so in general its a good series it has it upsides and downs the drawn could be better my good kill that catwoman nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes my favorites mad love jokers millions old wounds sins of the father and cold comfort if you enjoyed batman tas you can watch this but don t spec too much in the other hand if you didn t watched tas watch this first and then watch tas in that way you re really gonna love tas d:D
__label__0 after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review this is my first ever so bare with me first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn t particularly thrilled either the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in until she adds her constantly away father to the house due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach in conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab 
__label__1 i can t agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it s an all different matter i couldn t believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly the plot may be as bad as a js s show ie there is no plot but the acting is wicked it s hilarious and it s all in all an incredible trash movie it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america and i believe there are plenty of them are interested in after all it s the neighbours we re talking about don t we 100 fun 
__label__0 i felt this movie started out well the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation even though the true family unit was not completely revealed we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end and i was begging for it to just be over with any movie with such a long drawn out and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater this movie pulled me in then just spit me out 
__label__0 gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes i love 50 sci fi i even love cheesy 50s sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a mst3k kinda way virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best hip cat impression of abott costello chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moon but it can t in this case this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature that said i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so 
__label__1 let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there upon his death the show did drop off a bit but the producers didn t give up on the show adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005 the show centers around the hennessy family paul john ritter may he rest in peace his wife cate katey sagal their daughters bridget kaley cuoco kerry amy davidson and their son rory martin spanjers when ritter was on the show i would shriek in laughter and proud to admit it i am but now that he s gone i ll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh i m very glad that i fell for this show s trance after ritter s untimely death because it made the eps with ritter so much better ritter s character is just so well acted and well rounded that you can t help but love him he is always bossing the girls around about dating but he really wants them to be happy it s the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment katey sagal is great as well and she too is a likable character after ritter s death her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco davidson and spanjers because she and ritter had been friends for a long time the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy played by kaley cuoco she is the ultimate blonde gorgeous slow dim witted yet she is a smart person she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent blonde humor and how conceited she is amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry but that s the purpose of her character the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about she s always after bridget and her character feels like it s just thrown in there martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical and when ritter is on the show he s mostly comic material upon the death of ritter the show does provide some story lines for rory david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs with the occasional side story for c j spade s character garner plays cate s father as a bit of background information all in all i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it you ll enjoy it 9 10 spy
__label__0 the cover of box of this movie has kyle minogue s name on it but she has the same destiny as drew barrymore did in scream that s the first thing that makes this movie lame they are trying to market a movie with someone that s in it for 5 minutes of course we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there s a killer going around to top it all off molly ringwald of 80 s teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film it s a good career move for molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in australia so she won t get ridiculed in the states either way this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that s in it throughout the movie we re supposed to guess who s the killer long story short remember our little friend molly she saves the day or does she this move is just plain bad rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf don t spread the horror 
__label__1 before the devil knows you re dead starts off promisingly setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in rashomon style at around the hour mark sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually morphs into a multi faceted family drama exploring the full realm of human emotions relations as the story comes to its chilling climax as is the case with lumet he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star studded cast without any notion of over acting or hyperbole philip seymour hoffman in one of his best roles is a complex mysterious and interesting character and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke who plays his brother hank that s not to say that hawke is not bad in fact he is quite above adequate in a troubled role that suits his style marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this albert finney s character andy and hank s father is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserved a bit more screen time amy ryan also performs her job adequately before the devil knows you re dead is not an exceptional movie but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the apparent twilight of an illustrious career many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here not least of which involves the use of his characters infused with a killer script no pun intended smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score before the devil knows you re dead is a must see a truly underrated gem 8 10 3 stars out of 4 should just enter my top 250 at 248 highly recommended 
__label__1 let me set the scene it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies i am with my friend deciding what to see we look for a movie that is starting soon and the grinch comes up we buy tickets not knowing what to expect what we got was a roller coaster of fun jim carrey who may i add is my no 1 actor in the whole world was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard s best movie next to apollo 13 the way that this movie was made the scenery the actors the props and the music was just amazing it really brought this childhood movie to life the story is based upon the story of the grinch as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can t stand christmas he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk but one little girl is going to change the grinch s look on life and on others in a drastic way cindy lou who played by adorable new actress taylor momsem meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents a solid 10 10 well done jim 
__label__0 in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings that said casanova left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski casanova died too just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all to say that he lived well is true to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find that is why the human race stands where it does today we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas all hollow inside like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children as far as i could make it out this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject granted with more empathy but disgusted nonetheless casanova s environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in satyricon the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn just without the coherence and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction yet there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious fellini couldn t more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man a maestro for sure but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film it was a story not worth telling 
__label__1 johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it s overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense but that s the point right the cast is likable michael keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed griffin dunne peter boyle joe piscopo marilu henner and danny devito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me but the complete scene stealer here is richard dimitri sneaking the word iceholes into movie history as a mobster who fares best at murdering the english language i associate many childhood memories with this film as i watched it quite often so maybe i m prone to enjoy it more than many others johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking and sex i like it but it s hard to recommend 7 out of 10 
__label__1 i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don t understand how to watch a movie and or have little sense of elegance first to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together modern sensibilities demand great drama no i don t mean great setting of characters and plots but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic this is a subtle movie its beauty lies in its subtlety not to be confused with simplicity neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness politics human weakness venality you name it the world it s set in would be alien and not understood today a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly even if you only think you have it many people today don t understand that victorian society wasn t really victorian as people understand that term today this movie helps set the record straight 
__label__1 as a kid i loved this game i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored then streets of rage 2 came out and we quickly forgot that this one even existed you play as ex cops axel stone adam or blaze fielding who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way there are 8 levels to work thru in a run down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x beating up all the bad guys and the end of level boss is much fun level 4 the bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river you even have the chance to become mr x s right hand man at the end of the game at a price this leads to the bad ending in which you become the the boss of the syndicate exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr x but never mind streets of rage also has truly fantastic music the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis the main theme level one level 4 and final boss are standout tunes as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console but with streets of rage 2 also available it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete pros average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game great tunes easy to get into and hard to put down cons vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2 poor enemy ai baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat this is especially infuriating with the level 5 boss lack of combo moves lack of decent weapons bad guy models are repeated far too often graphics b sound a gameplay b lasting appeal b

__label__0 a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings she discovers that right before each ceremony the bride was given a rare orchid supposedly from the groom which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a dr lorenz who lives in a secluded estate with his wife in reality dr lorenz is responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young patricia along with dr foster who is working with dr lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife try to force dr lorenz s hand by setting up a phony wedding which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctor s clutches this movie had a very good opening reel but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes the cast is decent walters and coffin deserved better but that s life russell steals the show even out hamming lugosi who does not give one of his more memorable performances even considering his monograms as countess lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today s hollywood prima donnas weak and contrived ending as well rating based on b movies 4 
__label__0 the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem ah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i d say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u s government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say you ll see things a bit different than before first off weather data doesn t come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims :)
__label__1 i don t see how this show is like the oc at all first of all the oc centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time second the oc takes place in california north shore takes place in hawaii and why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part it has a good storyline and plot i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out it wasn t predictable like most stories on most shows i hope fox keeps it on the air 
__label__1 takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he s succeeding still this was the first of his films i d seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didn t treat kids like they re stupid and this one doesn t either the dark underlying morals are there but it s also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasn t bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and don t think kids will notice if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuring to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films zebraman the happiness of the katakuris sabu and the bird people in china good job takashi miike 8 10 stars 
__label__0 i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead you gotta love those bargain packs for even if they don t feature true remastering restoration and all that hoo ha and the films are generally in full frame pan and scan format there s no denying that there are always a few gems included and by gems i mean there s always some good crap to be seen especially if the films are from the 70s as the mansion of madness is my copy is called mansion of madness but when the title screens roll it s poe s dr tarr s torture dungeon doesn t matter really as crap is crap is crap no yes but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all there are some funky elements here and there and obviously the flick did have a decent budget the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look the dialogue is always hilarious near the beginning of the film the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road what strength says our hero funny then that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun you ll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end that s how memorable these characters are the best part about mansion of madness however has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure it s like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable and why all the weirdo slapstick anyway i d say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop what the hell oh yeah there s plenty of boobies to be seen too for those of you that dig such things boobies bad dialogue and wacky music that best sums of mansion of madness for me it s well worth at least one viewing and may be a lot better if you ve had a few to drink or whatnot i can t say i was ever bored watching it but i can t deny that it s also a barrel of poop kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot but not hmm and mr chicken pwnz

__label__0 this film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it but no even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid i found it as an offer in a magazine and that s why i ve seen it i regret the time i lost to see this 1 out of 10 because they don t have a lower grade 
__label__0 i ll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography otherwise it teems mainly with clichés and stereotypes mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind or wise white indians indians are magical people who move around without a sound can disappear in the blink of an eye talk to animals and read minds over large distances and so on and so forth throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains log cabins woods an assortment of animals free spirited mountain dwellers and freaky people in church the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth this was neither a story about growing up during the depression nor about about being an orphan nor about a struggle for identity it tried to be all of those things and more which made it superficial and unsatisfactory although the movie was supposed to be about little tree s education we learn almost nothing about it he was given a brief summary of the history of his people who were brave and stoic and a distillery demonstration tried his hand at chopping wood at which he failed and whiskey running literally learned how to read and maybe to write with the help of grandma and her dictionary and that was it apparently he didn t learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic however grandma and grandpa and graham greene s character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult after and i m paraphrasing here riding with the navajos and getting caught up in a couple of wars was to catch up with grandma and grandpa and graham greene s character in heaven instead of say dating girls getting married having children or other such nonsense last but not least i must say that i found grandpa s trade offensive why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still to counteract the stereotype of the drunken indian 
__label__0 before this made for tv movie began i had relatively low expectations that s because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone there is no president sheridan delenn lennier londo vir g kar or lyta if you remember on the second to last episode of the series all the regulars except zack vir and captain lockley left b 5 permanently now for this film they did bring back garibaldi who was not in the last b 5 movie to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance but because so much is gone of the old chemistry this film already is severely handicapped the movie is about a soul hunter martin sheen who is led to babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist ian mcshane a lot of spooky mumbo jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless yeah yeah the station nearly blew up but was saved and all but frankly i felt like it was a case of been there done that and done that a lot better in the past the secondary plot provided more for comic relief was much more interesting as an entrepreneur installed a holo brothel and those in command weren t sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close they were slapped with a lawsuit this was fluff but it did provide a few laughs something the other dreary plot was surely lacking by the way sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunter with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery however repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character this should have been spotted and corrected so the final verdict is this is only for total die hard b 5 nuts like myself others seeing it might assume the series sucked which is a great injustice this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit 
__label__1 this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made for television drama my all time favourite actor robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime and homicidal psychosis the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie building the fear and paranoia by degrees as well as the feel of the whole california setting the cars are really great as well as i recall i give this film a 10 and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute remember just because it s made for television doesn t mean it isn t great art 
__label__0 unlike many i don t find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive its execution however is another matter entirely like so many b minus movies all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers for most of the 22 or so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late night infomercial but not a primetime sitcom even a canadian one notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas unfortunately they got the tone and the script completely wrong for the prairies the final insult is that they apparently couldn t even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town why are they so hard to find in saskatchewan did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon and that the rest of the world primed by the cbc s publicists quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom 
__label__1 princess tam tam is without the trappings of racism in the way we think of racism in the united states but there are more subtle to the american viewer assertions about ethnic identity during the time pay attention to alwina s baker placement within shots how she is addressed by the other characters the settings around her that all depict her as a savage african and ask yourself if alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film i don t want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention the dichotomy between eastern and western culture is to say the least offensive such diction is thankfully disavowed these days the french have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted see chris marker s les statues meurent aussi 1953 and pay attention to the places the european travelers visit while they are in africa and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the other i give this film a 7 because i am a sucker for baker much of what she did in her professional career like princes tam tam that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration her work as a freaking spy i am gushing sorry however the film for me is captivating because of her performance besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities 
__label__0 this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the plot and message are horrible there are too many mistakes in this movie that it s impossible to keep up i don t even understand how this movie can get any nomination let alone 2 here s why 1 sam lee portrays a angry irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad pros he s angry alright cons when it comes to the explanation scene he cannot convey the sadness disappointment he has in his father the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes 2 to connect the movie to the title there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer i understand that it s supposed to be a metaphor or what not but it s just sooo dumb 3 why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer what the heck is wrong with this movie when the killer started stabbing an officer shoot him he s already dead what the heck there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed but i do not know why he wasn t 4 during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt in the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt so how the heck in the next scene that she s lending all her weight on her left foot and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer wtf 5 the sounds in the movie are off sync 6 i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight 7 this movie is just too violent without a purpose cops are beating ci to a pulp and then if they cooperate they give them marijuana and coke this is overall the worst movie i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life worst movie ever 
__label__0 firstly there are some good things about this film but it s all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that i ve seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but she s a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and what s with that look she gives everyone perhaps it s part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book it s based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time i ll read the book to find out rather than watch this 
__label__0 i don t understand why making remakes has become the trend every remake i have ever seen is awful and this is no exception if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones that it is a sleazy piece of trash he is quite right why they would take a wonderful television show which i loved have never missed an episode and own seasons 1 4 on dvd and ruin it i ll never know the television show was a family show and although daisy has the body it was really flaunted or even addressed in the show save the outfits a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage and i wouldn t recommend anyone go see it another thing i didn t like was that john schneider and tom wopat are excellent actors along with the rest of the original cast and they are also extremely cute the new bo and luke are not even a little cute that was one of the drawers for the show the casting is terrible they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy i don t think burt reynolds is a qualified boss hogg either every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse but still it is no comparison denver pyle is an actor all his own and that made him perfect for the role i think that the casting is awful the story is awful and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty terrible movie i wouldn t recommend anyone go see it i only saw it out of curiosity plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd i would never have paid to see this movie but it was free don t pay to see this movie 
__label__0 dave devon sawa and his friends sam jason segel and jeff michael maronna have scammed their way through college when creepy ethan jason schwartzman discovers their secret he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful good hearted student angela james king stupid and incompetent comedy a lot more groan inducing than laugh inducing movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags but none of them work what s more it s full of worthless unappealing characters and schwartzman s character is so repulsive he s a major turn off movie even tries using 50 s 60 s sexpot actress mamie van doren in the movie s most outrageous scene yuck further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste yet again of veteran comedic actor joe flaherty s talent when s this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile all in all the only thing i liked was james a k a jaime king who was very appealing and deserved better this gets no more than one out of ten from me 
__label__1 every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just won t give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak laurence harvey version the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can t speak russian i m sure funny how people miss the point the no goodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mind blowing 
__label__1 a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure the crown of the queen of sheeba from egypt the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco but it won t be an easy journey there are plenty of would be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown fortunately for all involved mr moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey however that doesn t mean someone won t try to get their hands on the treasure after the disappointment of mr moto s gamble i went into mr moto takes a vacation hoping for the best but admittedly fearing the worst but within the first 10 seconds of the film i knew i would find it more enjoyable i m a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist imagine that peter lorre playing a german the beginning scenes really drew me in while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco it remained just as enjoyable dark sinister characters lurking in the rainy night gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero s head sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them and master criminals believed to be dead these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love and mr moto takes a vacation s got em all a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role comic relief from g p huntley that s actually funny and a return to form for mr moto i ve already mentioned his disguise in the movie s opening scenes well the athletic moto comes out near the film s finale moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey all this and i haven t even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre any way you look at it mr moto takes a vacation is a winner as much as i hate that the mr moto series had to end after this installment it s understandable when you think about it wwii was just around the corner and after pearl harbor a movie with a japanese hero wouldn t have gone over very well at least the mr moto series ended on a very positive note 
__label__0 this was not enjoyable to watch frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal boring job just so his stepson can go to film school but his stepson decides that he ll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot not manipulate and comment with snide captions the bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious and sad the goal seems to be to make frank appear dumb and pathetic instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is it left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker 
__label__1 i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i don t love documentary i ve just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that s actually a movie came up this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny well that s about it cheers
__label__1 uggh i really wasn t that impressed by this film though i must admit that it is technically well made it does get a 7 for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor in fact i consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s it won the oscar for best picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing that s because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as meet me in st louis this movie is almost all singing and dancing in fact this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren t into this the film will quickly bore you give me more story as a result with overblown production numbers and a weak story this film is like a steady diet of meringue it just doesn t satisfy in the long run to think this is the film that beat out a streetcar named desire and a place in the sun for best picture and to make matters worse the african queen and ace in the hole weren t even nominated in this category even more amazing to me is that ace in the hole lost for best writing screenplay to this film even though an american in paris had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song 
__label__0 music that grinds on the nerves like fingernails on a blackboard acting that is so zombielike it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie casting everyone in it as true zombies with the cast of sabrina the teenaged witch as the heroes a movie so downright awful that if stoners were still around it might be considered a cult movie but oh so amateurish the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors their lines read as they slowly shuffled through the movie banal illogical sets modeled after la subdivisions props straight from toysrus was a movie ever made that is so completely and totally inept logic flies to the wind in this plodding senseless pointless and with a monster so stupid and uncoordinated that it couldn t catch a turtle in an icebox lowcut leggy and amazon it kept my attention all the way through the way a terrible ongoing chain accident in the fog involving multiple vehicles keeps one watching to the very end as after a ridiculous ray gun fight in a prison on another planet a pneumaticaly disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a retarded extra terrestrial fugitive to earth don t let anybody p s on your popcorn you might actually enjoy watching this one it s that bad 
__label__0 it s obvious that the people who made dead at the box office love b movie horror overt references to the genre are peppered throughout from stock characters the authority figure who doesn t believe the monstrous invasion is really happening to kevin smith style discussions to reenacting duane jones last moments from night of the living dead not once but twice unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie the staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative while a common admonition in film school is to avoid mastershot theatre telling the story completely in a wide master shot here we find the obverse as in several sequences it s hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts the lighting is flat and sometimes muddy making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out was there lighting or was this shot with available light only some shots are out of focus the dialogue is trite and the performances for the most part one note isaiah robinson shows some energy and screen presence as curtis and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings michael allen williams as the theater manager and casey kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek eric have some nice moments the premise is silly even for a b horror flick also it s too bad dr eisner was unaware of project paperclip he could ve saved himself a lot of trouble the zombies are non threatening and their makeup is unconvincing although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile for a zombie fan film there is very little blood or violence although what there is is handled pretty well the incidental music while stylistically uneven is kind of nice at times and there are some good foley effects the time warp parody was a fun listen although the images going along with it were less fun to watch unfortunately the looped dialogue sounds flat was this shot non sync doubtful it looks like video through and through i watched the special introduction by troma films lloyd kaufman before the main feature although it consisted essentially of kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he hadn t seen the movie while someone mugged in a toxie mask its production and entertainment values were higher than dead itself quick aside to whoever put the dvd together the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flash frame 2 not on every number plus one more after for that matter the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in dead looked a lot more entertaining than this recommendation to avoid unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent lloyd kaufman completist he plays kaufman the minion in the film within a film full disclosure my girlfriend is an extra in this movie i swear this did not color my review 
__label__0 this must be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i can t say i m picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just can t think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isn t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute 
__label__1 i ll be honest i finally checked this movie not because of the stars though they were reasonably watchable and compelling particularly the three leads or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service something i ve been informed through the dvd extras of this show has yet to ever happen assuming that s true that s remarkable i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis well okay clark johnson one of my faves from homicide life on the street and a veteran mostly tv director i d say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average despite the possibilities veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison michael douglass has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez david rasche anyone remember sledgehammer his affair with the first lady kim basinger clearly one of the hotter first ladies we ve ever had fictional or real is certainly not helping his standing he s got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief kiefer sutherland almost still completely in 24 mode throw in some other pivotal service agents martin donovan and the foxy somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn t aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired if underwhelming results the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most myself included interested 
__label__1 yes this gets the full ten stars it s plain as day that this fill is genius the universe sent trent harris a young wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape in all that true misfit glory that you just can t fake too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow s story the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men respectively the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america recommended for anyone and everyone 
__label__0 i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad i mean it is just a sh ty rip off of dexter s laboratory and johnny quest bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay at home dad and a smart super busy mom like oh my flippin god their dad is a mother f kin crazy home maker isn t that so gay if my dad is a home maker i would personally die of shame that is really i would i have nothing else to about this this travesty but only 3 word count them 3 words to describe it lame stupid and above all f k up that s all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev er if i had one that is 
__label__0 the robin cook novel coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment but in the case of sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and leaden pacing the only reason it escapes a 1 out of 10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself hard to believe franklin j schaffner of patton and planet of the apes is the director behind this debacle pretty egyptologist erica baron lesley anne down is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu hamdi john gielgud hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica for it could provide vital clues in locating seti i s long lost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamun s tomb in 1922 before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen erica attempts to track down the treasure she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly trustworthy for one there is yvon maurice ronet seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives then there is akmed khazzan frank langella an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her the biggest problems with sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility down couldn t be less convincing as a female egyptologist one assumes she would be quite well educated and resourceful yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick on those rare occasions that she actually isn t running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4 000 year old tomb the plot twists are heavy handed to say the least mainly comprising of revelations and double crosses that can be predicted well in advance one can t even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully sluggish what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium a famous review of the movie declared sphinx stinks never before has a 2 hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words 
__label__1 the fourth man paul verhoeven netherlands 1983 a film based on a novella by gerard reve that works best as a thriller that s quite surprising considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work the fourth man is top heavy on symbolism paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i m never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out in the fourth man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity of which there s plenty but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn t get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes there s hardly a scene without sex or full frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story nevertheless when you can cope with verhoeven s pretty obvious satiric approach it s quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round thom hoffman and jeroen krabbé in particular camera obscura 7 10
__label__0 the movie deserves 2 10 1 5 stars for the girl i m sorry i m biased i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies and 0 5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1 i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating i amazed myself being able to sit through it lets talk about the plus points of the movie the girl ueto aya is cute thats all there is to salvage the whole movie the fact is if the main character was male i am sure that most people including me would not have touched the movie at all now lets talk about the minus points firstly it is real draggy with lots and lots of repeated scenes scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back it seems more like a drama way of shooting typical japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie too secondly the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting i do not mind unrealistic movies but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs etc it reminds me of shinobi though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting moreover to portray i don t know what effect the director films people dying with blood spraying literally all around people not realizing their head was cut off etc etc etc too many of these spoils the show it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie it degrades the show greatly thirdly isn t azumi supposed to be an assassin she seems more like an one man army to me just that she is a female i don t think you see assassins charging into army camps the only time i felt she acted assassin liked was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1 lastly the plot was thin in both movies its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way 
__label__1 this complicated western was a milestone in the career of james stewart after his return from war service wanting to change his image by doing a western which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the 50s since it s very impressive too bad it wasn t photographed in technicolor stewart wins first prize for the gun that won the west but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it s stolen shelley winters is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and stephen mcnally is the local bad boy gunman in dodge city will geer is wyatt earp and dan duryea is shelley s bad boyfriend and wouldn t you know that it being a universal international film tony curtis and rock hudson both quite unknown at the time have bit roles an interesting sequence features the first indian attack whereby charles drake reveals himself to be a coward who rides off leaving shelley alone in the horse drawn wagon he later redeems himself but it s just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another but finally ending up with the rightful owner stephen mcnally and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic but not quite as duel in the sun s blazing guns finale mcnally makes the perfect villain and dan duryea is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the 40s as a low life gunslinger tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by anthony mann and it s fun to see rock hudson credited as young bull wearing indian war paint and tony curtis as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive shelley winters well worth viewing and definitely an above average story 
__label__1 prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and slapstick only i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls but this masterful film proved me wrong davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball i mention lucy primarily because davies mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasn t one of ball s primary influences this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy and i must say that no matter how much of the period specific references you actually get i didn t apparently you will not be bored by this movie you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time 
__label__1 picking up right after the moscow showdown of supremacy this is bourne s greatest adventure and his final climax throughout the tight 115 min runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid paris marocco and ultimately new york damon is every inch of the hard trained killer robert ludlum imagined he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now and it s the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable and it s exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar opposites of himself that s so breathtaking in this third bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it ultimatum delivers such an high octane performance that you ll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull offs just look out for two great car chases and a fight scene as realistic as bond vs shaw back in 63 director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get a true pay off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy thriller standard 
__label__1  soapdish is one of the best yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990 s the film revolves around the various off camera drama s that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera the first of the film s various impressive strengths is it s fantastic a list cast soapdish features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it s era the film is superbly led by sally field as the neurotic ageing actress celeste talbert she famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like gloria f cking swanson her supporting cast reads like a who s who of 90 s movie greats whoopi goldberg robert downey jr teri hatcher kevin kline and kathy najimy all elevate the film greatly goldberg is predictably excellent whilst downey jr s and hatcher s performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve in terms of writing the film is outstanding there is a really modern edge to the script which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time in some ways the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of high anxiety 1977 much of the film s humour hinges on it s often scathing but pretty accurate representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors for example the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher is both hilarious and honest soapdish is for my money one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990 s it s excellent script and a class cast make it a must see it s hard not to love this film after it s kept you laughing for 90 minutes 
__label__1 if you are uninitiated to the gundam world this is a good place to start if you are burned out on star wars or star trek here is a compelling realistic sci fi series you can become immersed in not the simplistic boy saves world in giant robot story you might have expected but rather a complex emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the good and bad guys is decidedly less than distinct gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier bernie wiseman by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice i loved this oav series with its cool mecha designs involving story and likeable characters i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment

__label__1 sunday would not be sunday without an action movie and when you want intense combat you turn to tom berenger platoon here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords life s a bitch so he gets a green office type billy zane to help on the mission the film is in the hands of luis llosa who stunk up anaconda he doesn t do much better here but berenger makes the movie worthwhile sure it may be a little long who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle but is is good tense action when the time is right 
__label__1 after watching this film last night on sundance i realized that much of nakata s style was first done in this film here we have many of the same elements of the ringu series especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural instead of the cursed videotape we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film in fact the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in ringu to mind the only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through nakata s later films the final scenes are quite chilling with a bit of a nod to murnau what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room reminds me immediatly ofnosferatu a chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk 
__label__0 i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening and despite the fact that i didn t pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off ladies and gentlemen time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat the acting is torpid at best kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey eva longoria is a non entity she looks like she s reading her lines off a teleprompter and if you can t spot the mole within the first 20 minutes then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller rent in the line of fire if you see and buy into this one you ll start to fear for the president s safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown up versions of the kinds from 90210 no matter what your feelings about w let s hope this art does not imitate life 
__label__0 i have begun to melt so i will make this review as short and sweet as possible there s this astronaut and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys ya know except something happens that exposes him to radiation and then when they come back well never mind what happened to the other guys but our astronaut has begun to melt no not just burn up but melt like an ice cream cone in july well ok maybe not that fast but ya know what i mean anyway he gets all red gooey and the fact that he s melting makes him really mad i guess he also checked out the melting man handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away he has to eat human flesh so he starts ripping people apart there are other characters but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts and melts do you really need any others what s important is who will he munch next and what will be left of them how long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing why was this movie made in the first place where did they get the money when will you fall asleep while watching it i ve very nearly melted but i still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross the makeup is neat but everything else is splat
__label__1 they re not jawing journalists cary grant and rosalind russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in scoop their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post depression allen s writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great splendini magician responds about his background i was born into the hebrew persuasion but when i got older i converted to narcissism johansson fresh from allen s match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a reworking of his recent london based thriller match point right down to the upper class sins and the american tragedy place in the sun boating accident as a matter of fact allen is reworking manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of cairo to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he reworks i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatness allen as director and actor can t hide his love for the actress as he couldn t for diane keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upper class murderer sid allen quips i d be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards scoop with music from grieg tchaikovsky and strauss to let us know the woodman has not lost his touch of class 
__label__0 well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kira s sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies it just doesn t look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end kira s new lover is a killer whoa how shocking why don t we nominate this movie for oscar award i can t imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r rated mine is imported from uk rated 18 conclusion put it down and walk away so yon won t end up with being a moron like me score 2 10
__label__1 legend of zui remember well tsui hark s original zu warriors made 18 years earlier over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it s been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog in fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic prime so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies well the answer is i can t say but that was because this isn t really a remake the stories and styles are almost completely different the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is reincarnated as enigma and insomnia has returned to destroy zu meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomnia the plot isn t one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero but unlike the other two this film was one which didn t overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful nothing appears rushed unlike hero the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing it was possibly on the verge of too many cooks but generally each character had its part in the story but some of the roles appear to be extended cameos in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film but i couldn t say this film showed their best performances cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw kelly lin was the new revelation for me despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to ogling overall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the original given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades and one beauty of that is the fact that you can t really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pears ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right and i m going back to reminisce by watching the original again two to watch but not compare 
__label__0 unless you re twelve this movie really isn t worth it it s obviously a low budget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work that s not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didn t know how bad though it s bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire fighting there s no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again it s obviously a kid s movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something it s bearable but much better if you re say nine 
__label__1 which do you think the average person would know more less about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi s latest film entitled offside a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one s right to do something or go somewhere and an individual s right to extend that courtesy if and when they d like to the odd thing is you don t come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless it s an education in panahi s controversial style but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it i can remember the 2006 world cup i m sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain 82 when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria anyone in britain that was watching the bbc s broadcast of the iran mexico game both nations first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the bbc s football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match it went something like we ve seen giants germany england argentina and holland play but now we get to see mexico and iran battle it out the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore it s a shame because there are people and films like offside present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well being to achieve it and it s sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem inferior when there are others who d do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage when immediately thinking of the words iran football and world cup my mind flies back to the france 98 game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran s famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran s victory as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they defeat a western power or enemy at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 indian film lagaan in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket similalry 2005 s the game of their lives sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the 1950 world cup the differences between these films and offside are immense offside is looking at a situation behind a state s mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men may not will but may use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man s right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman s right to see the game all together it is no wonder panahi s film was itself banned in iran but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match panahi pays special attention to the title of his film offside which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an attacker is caught trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the womens position in the film as these advancing supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itself i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i ve seen it s a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo realist aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i ve mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the iranian government 
__label__1 director brian yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre creating masterpieces such as return of the living dead 3 or bride of re animator but at the same time he has done awful movies such as faust love for the damned or the mediocre progeny he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart gordon s films has been superb the dentist is one of his lesser works as director but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience it tells the story of dr alan feinstone played superbly by corbin bernsen a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife linda hoffman has an affair with the pool boy this event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so filthy the premise is very well handled by yuzna as he takes us on a ride following feinstone s day of revenge what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim s perspective we follow feinstone because he is the main character we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie most of the success of the premise is in bernsen s performance as feinstone he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film the rest of the cast is not as good and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should a notable exception is ken foree as the detective trying to catch feinstone while his part is quite small he makes a great job with it with a dentist as killer gory scenes are expected and brian yuzna delivers great sfx in the correct amount it s good to see that he does not go over the top with it as he usually do and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film it has the exact amount of gore that is expected nothing less and nothing more yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great while this is not among yuzna s most well known films i would say that it is one of his best sure it is not classic material as his masterpieces but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring it is a low budget simple film but for what it is i think it rocked 7 10
__label__0 the beginning of the 90s brought many quirky and off beat independent films a particular sub genre of which is the semi spiritual desert crime movie others of note are wild at heart from dusk til dawn and to a certain extent natural born killers good films like those spawned junk like highway 666 destiny turns on the radio and this ineptly surreal anti masterpiece under the hula moon it s a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone attains it but keeps going to the point of irritation while the pursuit across the spirit world of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie and isn t focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy i won t blow the ending but let s just say it s bad the film is basically a bad side effect of genre cancer this is the dregs of indie mania 
__label__0 what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can t deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer particularly car alarms it s an odd idea for a film which has about as much creative credibility as death wish it is clever at points particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel i m too stupid to be understanding this he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion we read it and don t get it either just then a car alarm goes off throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises though all in all it does little to help us understand our hero who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper into his persona the film making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems shoddy editing and visible boom mikes no noise isn t all bad william hurt is at least colorful at least the ending doesn t fall flat overall it drives home a logistical point one you haven t probably thought of at least i hadn t though all in all ninety minutes long it couldn t have ended sooner the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival but probably won t get picked up for distribution check it out on dvd if you re really partial to someone involved in the project otherwise skip it 
__label__0 i loved this movie i ll admit it this has to be the best straight to video movie i ve seen well me and my friend decided just for shits n giggles that we d rent this movie we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected plus more when that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the sasquatch we literally watched that part about three to four times it was that amazing hysterically of course and why oh why does the main character have to roll that much like honestly we know that you re in danger rolling that much isn t gonna help all that much but really if this movie is in you re local video store rent it it is worth the money and it s not even that bad like it s bad but not incredibly bad overall complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie 
__label__0 after having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country i but wanted to see it but what a disappointment to see a bunch of one dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend i sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland 
__label__0 i am a big fan of ludlum s work and of the covert one books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start from the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffin s first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smith re naming re assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire back story of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistake rachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covert one which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covert one doesn t even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covert one devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism to be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation i m afraid you ll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lack luster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dull as ditch water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film 
__label__0 i watched this film a long time ago aprox 10 years or so and liked it then i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again the second time around was not pleasant the acting is so so the plot is illogical unreasonable and predictable the acting i m sure it wasn t a stretch for those actresses to play those characters the plot there s no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd side note why did tt not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer ding ding we have a crook it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can beat the system or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources it plays too much on sympathy b c all of them die in the end bar jada but it s not sad you re thinking they were so stupid they deserve to die you just don t really care about the characters unless you re a shallow person i can t believe this film rates over a 5 
__label__1 along with king of the rocket men this was still being repeated on bbc tv in the early to mid eighties if i was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the serials don del oro will make you laugh when i was little my nickname for him was mr dustbin head and it was funny upon being shot at he says your bullets can t harm me then he stumbles back seemingly less than happy i also like the way he dispenses with sebastian in the first episode i watched this again because i had good memories of it from years back there are some good stunts and good music it has the ingredients you expect including water rockfalls runaway carts apart from the first episode with ralph faulkner the swordplay wasn t nearly as good as i remembered it and yes it features the inevitable flashback episode it gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace padding and the other tricks if you are interested in these serials i recommend the book by william witney in a door into a fight out a door into a chase although there is only a small entry about this series in it 
__label__0 five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up but is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye lucky me five bad movies for the price of one each segment features the very worst in acting special effects make up and music and these were supposed to be scary hmm i think i ve been more freaked out during an episode of teletubbies i swear you ll sit there like i was bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen don t bother it never does in fact i even stopped fast forwarding the commercials as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature and the ending is the ultimate cop out yep none of this actually ever happened if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this cobblers 2 10
__label__0 i ve seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren t too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don t have much to do with the story i ve seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case here also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and then it just cuts to another scene i m aware that this can be a dramatic effect that s definitely not the intention here it s just bad editing finally there s the ghost who just screams in a way that s not scary or unintentionally funny it s annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued it was better than the whole film simply put avoid 
__label__0 absolutely awful movie utter waste of time background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligible camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this 
__label__1 a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him this comes to us from director rob schmidt who made wrong turn a film i have not seen with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting schmidt to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense my apologies to him for my underestimation as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this is only the foundation on which the story revolves once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense i was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of hellraiser in this through the first part of the show i had no idea what they were talking about then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of hellraiser 2 however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than hellraiser 2 some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look i didn t watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that it s confusing the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him he s somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story if you will i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but he s completely unlovable while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i m excited about the washingtonians episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the genre s future but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope this one is a keeper and please bring schmidt back for season 3

__label__1 ok so it s an adult movie but it really is very tastefully done it s obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was even the acting was fairly decent the plot was more solid than most adult films i ve seen the camera work was above average it s just a good flick 
__label__0 i have to say this is an awful movie for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide it is listed as a documentary as i watched it i started laughing thinking to myself does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real so i had to look it up and now see that it is a movie but now since it isn t a documentary it is now a movie with bad acting so either way it is pretty bad i actually didn t make it to the end i had to shut it off i am a nyc police officer and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers so i took it a little personal maybe i was blinded by that and it isn t as bad as i personally think it is everyone has their own opinion 
__label__1 i m not at all picky about horror movies and i m willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesn t mean that i m willing to re watch many of them or that i won t have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent double bill with session 9 i should specify before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i can t vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death this is one of the rare movies that doesn t shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie the couple is not doing well the wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and that s legitimate he s trying to give her more direction it s a role that men sometimes take on there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video 
__label__0 the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross breeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic cast i m afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves adam brooks script may well be to blame but you d expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda instead the two ping pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france jean reno co stars amiably as the cop with a heart and i guess wishes he was a star with a part mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake s so perhaps he was ok with this 3 10

__label__1 i have screened this movie several times here at college and every time i show it the number of people watching with me grows exponentially in addition to the virgins anyone i ve already shown it to needs to see it again it takes a little while to get into it but by the end the whole room is screaming shouting yelling rewinding scenes repeatedly repeating dialogue and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in the lonely lady scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed poorly written horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own no small statement friends for me nothing compares 2 u pia and i don t suppose i m the only one who s ever felt this way 
__label__0 not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot during the whole film i was like erm what is this movie all about i don t get the animations at all probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s during the film there is a group of people walked out after the movie many people said that s it frankly speaking i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award if you are thinking of watching this film i strongly recommend you not to you will regret it i m not joking you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it 
__label__1 an end of an era was released here in the states in spring 2002 with the rookie a disney live action film that seemed to be the best for last it took place right here in texas actually the story began in west texas as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional what i liked about this movie it was sooo nice it was a very good sports movie ala the mighty ducks trilogy it had also taken moviegoers across texas from somewhere between the panhandle and el paso all the way to the metroplex where i live i can tell because i recognize that ballpark was the ballpark in arlington now it s ameriquest field it was nice to see disney s golden age end here in my area r i p golden age of disney1920s spring 2002 it all started with a mouse and it ended with baseball sobs 10 10
__label__0 the original show was so much better they should have left on a good note this movie killed the whole idea it was boring over dramatic and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel not to mention that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again so sorry tyler perry but try harder next time this movie is just kinda dull and not that funny either sorry 4 10 stars is it jay addison
__label__0 five years after the original creepshow another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a romero and stephen king creepshow 2 this time there are only three stories instead of five none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either the first story is a horror staple formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners the effects are really neat in this story but it s just too familiar to be compelling enough george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners the second story the raft is a stephen king story it s about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason however instead of being suspenseful the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey headed behavior preventing us from really caring about what happens next there is also some unintentional humor in this segment the third and final story is the hitch hiker which is actually a retread re adapted for creepshow 2 the original story by lucille fletcher was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens the hitch hiker works the best out of these three offerings but it s not without its problems either lois chiles plays a cheating spouse who ends up running over a hitch hiker or so she thinks however we don t know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her as in many average stories of this type the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place tom savini appears as the creep in this installment the good thing is there haven t been any more sequels 1 2 of 4 stars 
__label__1 in the previews the 40 year old virgin boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40 ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn t too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely and then the unexpected happens he falls in love what s more there s a movie out about it and it s called the 40 year old virgin the virgin of the title is andy stitzer steve carell who is indeed 40 works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see he has a lovely home theater system and watches survivor with his two kind elderly neighbors he s a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women now here s the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute mature fashion this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community which are in no way meant to be taken as gay bashing as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game mortal kombat deception no less the ultimate testosterone driven fightfest for guys as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar themed movie could never have been i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past 40 a bit arrogant i know but would you you is italicized still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of the 40 year old virgin of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise don t ask and he s pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex when it s first discovered andy is a virgin at 40 his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen all at first assume he s gay because he s never been with a woman which couldn t be any further from the truth the truth is andy loves women but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the sidelines for good david jay and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid so help them all but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster as proved by one date with nicky leslie mann who puts andy through the worst drunk driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth elizabeth banks the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend things brighten up for andy when he meets trish catherine keener the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people hmmm and with that nice looking collection of action figures you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him that is if he can ever do the deed at last this is the sex romp we ve been waiting for it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let s look at the big picture how many of us lonely guys want to be a lonely guy forever the important thing we re taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself i don t think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does which is side splitting to be honest and according to this website and various other news articles was in fact real and so was the blood on carell s shirt afterward the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd apatow and co written by himself and carell which originated as a skit that starred carell carell is sweet and human as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i ve ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect even carell s buddies who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities can be related to on a fundamental level the way the 40 year old virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end but i ll leave that up to you the viewer to observe surely if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener then it s true it is never too late 10 10
__label__0 the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script co written by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallone sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinion rambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex forces to placate rambo the mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told it s not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only after a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camp he finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the 3 flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on board rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found steven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base he resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centre a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man 
__label__1 one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film can i actually call it that it would invoke the devil out of its fans on a micro budget but packed with such taste sensitiveness and maturity peter sollett you deserve more admiration and respect thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the industry that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet one location a handful of rich characters low budget good acting and that too amateurs decent lighting worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop watching well you know what 
__label__0 story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of it s singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level it s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly

__label__1 i saw the description of the movie on tcm and only let it run because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith so i was delightfully surprised to find that i really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often i also was quite taken with the performances of smith and ustinov as the leads and of karl malden bob newhart and the cameo appearances by robert morley and cesar romero 
__label__0 in fact these young people were so distasteful that i couldn t wait for all of em to get slaughtered and that includes clarissa joanna canton since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background it had nowhere to go but down even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing i m sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh t since it ll appeal to that bunch it sure didn t appeal to me blah and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself she still looks hot though i m glad she takes care of herself since we don t get to see too much of her nowadays however it is a step up from dante tomaselli s meandering horror 2002 in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so i ll give it that much that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film lion s gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up 2 out of 10
__label__0 first of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note a 10 year old girl playing around in a moving vehicle decides it would be funny to cover up her mom s eyes with her hands and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom duh i am sorry there is positively no 10 year old that dumb the rest of the movie does not get much better after the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10 year old on the planet the dad moves the family to genova italy where he is to teach at a local university but here is the clincher he does not speak a word of italian then the little girl has visions of mommy who she killed and often subsequent night terrors which always always end by the father holding and coddling her then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found followed by of course more hugging and crying to the point that i was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid ignorant people off the planet do not get me wrong because i love indies but an indie about dumb people and i mean really dumb is simply ridiculous and pointless it is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios because the locale was interesting 
__label__0 can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever answer yes and this is one of them after helming the appalling house of the dead director uwe boll has now cast his less than talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation don t these guys get it to anyone who can t understand here it is in block capitals for you video games do not make for good movies the acting here is at best sub standard the set design and special effects are poor unlike the video game which did have its scary moments the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom no sense of danger or menace pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper the main culprit is the director uwe boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush hackneyed zooms swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets avoid at all costs 
__label__1 in the beginning of this film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him he is black and male but in addition to that he has a third strike he s gay you re going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined he is told paris is burning is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals the miracle of paris is burning is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity we learn their views of homosexuality men women their hopes their disappointments their dreams some of these dreams are so unattainable it s tragic many of the people are seriously in denial this is not a film for everyone there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals if you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie isn t for you but if you do see this movie you ll realise paris is burning isn t really about men wearing women s clothes it s about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives i ve watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things it s a commentary about materialism in our culture about gender roles about rich and poor people about the media and what it celebrates about fame and adulation paris is burning is one of the most humane and one of the saddest movies i ve ever seen 
__label__1 big splashy film of the broadway music nathan frank sinatra loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games blonde loving adelaide vivian blaine wants to marry him if he gives up craps he decides on one last game when sky masterson marlon brando who bets big is in town he bets sky that he can t get mission worker sarah brown jean simmons to go with him to havana that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie this is a real mixed bag there s some wonderful stuff here the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end also brando is really quite good here it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off i have to admit seeing big bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long suffering girlfriend her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here now for the bad parts jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she s stuck with a drab colorless role and can t do much with it the movie is far too long at 150 minutes the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened also most of the characters speak in very precise english contractions are never used maybe it s trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie it s worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while i give it a 7 
__label__0 there is a lot to like here the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit likable family however for that reason the film does not ring true we see leo who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself as well the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him the young actor who plays leo s brother marcel is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast unfortunately the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim so it only hints at both while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers 
__label__0 since rugrats falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years obviously the tyrants at klasky csupo should be out of ideas after dumbing down all of the characters adding even stupider new ones replacing some voices though i like nancy cartwright she is not chucky finster and having no sense of continuity ex in a kimi episode i watched the other day tommy and chucky each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode the aforementioned dogs never appear you d think the creators could kill the show for mercy but noooo all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks while not as horrible as the kimi episodes everyone is even stupider than they were including grandpa my god he used to be the best character on the show but now he has no real purpose the ending is needlessly fluffy and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes 98 01 is that the kids can interact with adults whoa what fun no stars at all for the rugrats all growed up klasky csupo please destroy this show before it gets any worse 
__label__1 i m fond of this film and it vexes me that so many reviewers rank it below the peter jackson trilogy a filmed novel is always interpretive in particular an animated film relies on the artist s vision and should be judged on its own terms speaking as a purist this is a finer homage to tolkien than the updated version while this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source especially so far as the characters are concerned in the jackson version tolkien s frodo is barely recognizable from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling constantly wavering manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet this is physically and metaphorically true you wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom jackson unforgivably rewrites tolkien and robs frodo of his finest moment when he allows arwen to rescue him from the ringwraiths bakshi s version respects the original presenting a frodo who demands the wraiths go back and trouble me no more bakshi sustains frodo s character as tolkien conceived it we see his decline as the weight of his burden increases frodo is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties he does so with numerous characters since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion bakshi s film better explores the companionship between legolas and gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in jackson s version similarly we see boromir horsing with pippin and merry furthering the idea of fellowship for my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action tolkien s poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes when frodo sings the merry old inn song minutes before stumbling into strider the cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths frodo is dangerously exposed this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it the well documented budget time restrictions limit this film s final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers as it is it s worth a look even its detractors admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype 
__label__0 this film is so incredibly bad that i almost felt sick watching it up until this point the other installments had at least one good thing about it part 1 was suspenseful and gory part 2 was off beat and entertaining part 3 was interesting with great effects part 4 had great music good special effects and a new entertaining freddy krueger part 5 is more boring than anything i ve ever seen before alice a much prettier blond from part 4 is back with her boyfriend dan at parts this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap the newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder freddy seems to be completely out of this one he looks tired and doesn t seem to be as gruesome his one liners seem out of place and different where as in part 4 they could be pretty funny leslie bohem s story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic it s also confusing and pretty stupid avoid part 5 at all costs 
__label__0 humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped 
__label__1 this is something new there s a coup d etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator mentally unstable new hitler etc without repercussion from the governments side like say silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods oh and they still claim that they are being suppressed of course see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals how much more stupid can you get and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace holding the constitution in their hands and reinstall their elected government this sounds like a hollywood fairytale but it happened for real against the explicit wishes of the usa the documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of the action acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup the good democratic freedom loving benevolent usa who still channel large amounts of money to chavez political opponents also highly entertaining and exciting 10 points 
__label__1 there s a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn t direct a horror film of quality if he had to and sleepwalkers screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this i like sleepwalkers though i fully am aware that garris just says f ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway it s about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers feline human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents moving from town to town living a nomadic existence truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn t surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother shan t tolerate the possible death of her beloved son garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacher glenn shadix suspecting handsome all american charmer charles brady brian krause to be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles lures pretty virgins into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama mary alice krige the fresh new target is tanya robertson mädchen amick and she seems to be easy pickens but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle thanks to a deputy s cat clovis mary s vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son like many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy dolenz i was smitten with mädchen amick she s simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his ulterior motives i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i would ve welcomed her in the genre with open arms krige is yummy as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya s parents in one fail swoop in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn cob she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman before cracking his arm a bone protruding knocking him unconscious with his own elbow she tosses tanya s mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father s face a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop kebab falling on the pencil for extra impact poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans we see mary and charles abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers joe dante and john landis as photograph experts the film is shot in a tongue in cheek let it all hang out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home it s about the ultra violence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris direction and king s screenplay the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in your face without a lick of complexity this is closer in vein to king s own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works 
__label__1 this film was on last week and although at that time of the day around 6pm the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on mexican tv i couldn t switch the tv off the story about madelene moore really touches you she doesn t come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed this film really leaves you thinking and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting compliments to brooke i hope to see her in another film soon 
__label__0 i just finished dark chamber aka under surveillance and i m stunned stunned not by the film but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it the story was so ravaged by plot holes and the majority of the acting so flat categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate seriously i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom s warnings that dad is no good when a young woman is found murdered justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments with the help of a couple pals he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks as the truth begins to unravel justin uncovers an unexpected secret one positive point is that felissa rose is hot i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit but no such luck it would have been the film s potential saving grace eric conley played justin very adeptly i thought and i wouldn t be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future the general premise of the film although plagued by clichés might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members most notably alexandra eitel kayla and david h rigg justin s father the horror pardon the pun i have nothing against low budget films indeed i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come i ll cut low budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects lighting even musical score and the overall picture quality i don t give allowances however for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover s script there are a vast number of competently made low budget films out there sadly this isn t one of them i can t help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way affiliated with its production 
__label__1 there are many adaptations of charlotte brontë s classic novel jane eyre and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min length consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine s life there are three tv mini series released in 73 83 and 2006 the 2006 version is not only the worst of these three but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film the novel s beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set it is a silly soap opera in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake this jane eyre as it dares to call itself is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte brontë the 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by jane s voice overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured another problem is the casting of the main characters sorcha cusack s portrayal of jane as a bold self confident worldly wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model and michael jayston although a good actor does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience all the faults of the 73 version stand corrected in the tv mini series of 83 with timothy dalton and zelah clarke although from a purist s point of view timothy dalton is too handsome tall and lean to be rochester he possesses the essential qualities for the role he has an imposing physical presence great magnetism and an air of self assurance and authority and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochester s character of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all rochester s harshness nearly insolence his moodiness and abruptness as well as his humorous side his tenderness his solicitude and deep frantic love dalton s handling of charlotte brontë s language is equally superb even rochester s most far fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them he is the definitive rochester unsurpassed and unsurpassable and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester she portrays exactly the jane of the novel an outwardly shy reserved and guarded young woman but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will she catches beautifully the duality in jane s character her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight as regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the 73 version but with one important difference the dialogues are shortened in this version but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte brontë s language and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the 73 series it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane s life it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel and the only one which does full justice to the novel s pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill he renders with almost painful intensity rochester s anguish as he realizes jane s resolution to leave him his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him it is a heartbreaking almost devastating scene which will stay with the viewer for a long time with even the smaller roles perfectly cast an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true jane eyre 
__label__0 as many agree origin is a beautiful anime artistically the music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works however if you are looking for more than this than i suggest looking else where the beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters there s nothing special action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there so in summary oh my goodness i ve never seen an anime as beautiful as this one and oh my goodness it s like poke people don t act like that it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately there s not even that much action to make up for that 
__label__1 a wonderful film filled with great understated performance and sharp intelligent dialogue what really distinguishes the film however is that undercurrent of sadness throughout the story is underscored by affairs loneliness suicide disappointment the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed having been ripped apart by the beginning of world war ii in fact the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes yet funny it is listen to margaret sullivan s harsh dismissal of jimmy stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend of poetry and meanness it s funny pointed and sad all at once a remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made 
__label__1 shot in the heart is wonderful it brilliantly illustrates the plight of gary gimore a convicted murder who requested death shot in the heart shows the ordeal that gilmore s family torn up by hatred went through this movie is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting 10 10
__label__0 the original movie dated 19 did not show any monster it just suggested scary things this version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects the mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous this is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
__label__0 i have to confess that i am severely disappointed this version can in no way compete with the version of 1995 the reason why i watched it was that i wasn t entirely happy with ciaran hinds as captain wentworth and thought that rupert penry jones looked much more like the captain i had imagined when i read the book and he was too unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film the rest is as un austen like as possible miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this it wasn t in her character and it just wasn t done by a lady of the those times the anne elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity there are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst although there are 3 important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed and although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their dispositions and motives important scenes were omitted how could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way a disaster and it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one no no no if you love austen then don t waste your time with this 
__label__1 when i saw this as a child it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that i had it is easy to watch because it is animated which makes it unthreatening it has no moral bias or preachy aspects so nobody should have any objections to it it is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring matter of fact way i hope to show it to my daughter 
__label__0 i was raised in a very christian household since birth i was saved before i saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church this movie was highly disturbing i saw it when i was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years i used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom s footsteps upstairs if i didn t hear her footsteps i would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn t been raptured i used to pray so hard every night for salvation because i was terrified of jesus forgetting me this is definitely not something i will show to my kids until they are much older if at all it took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me 
__label__0 you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates a k a reads the script plot synopsis over his character s funeral procession a mere 5 minutes into the movie the narration is his character s last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants the children shall split 136 million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality show there is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voice over by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux german expressionism the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children share celluloid rehab
__label__0 weak bobby pineapple salsa flay and mario batali bring this down flay being the worst definitely a one trick pony i think they could have gotten other american chefs to come to the table on this one as the iron chefs the kind of dishes this duo come up with really don t reflect on the creativity of the original iron chef series i don t think batali even went to chef school actually there are a lot of great chefs in america i just wonder why they don t appear on the food network it would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co hosts who can handle the pressure i like alton brown but he is a bit too flippant funny for this role 
__label__1 the hanson brothers andy apparently has his act together and hank clearly doesn t have his act together need money andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole hanson family this film delivers this is a layered full blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing as a crime drama thriller i would happily compare it to no country for old men while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills devil is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace no country is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while devil is a bit more enjoyable there is definitely less violence in devil than no country the acting delivers as well ethan hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deer in the headlights look to the besieged hank philip seymour hoffman as andy has the film s hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything there s really not much wrong with this film it jumps back and forth without being confusing events spiral out of control but the film never does the writing from first timer kelly masterson directing veteran sidney lumet and the editing stay as tight as a drum in many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like the departed and no country squeezed this one out of the limelight if you liked those you ll like this 
__label__0 having the in laws over for the weekend then this is the film to hasten their departure failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship which is more superannuated car ferry the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list an interesting piece of added amusement is playing spot the villain as passengers join the ship you won t be wrong with a script that sinks faster than a brick clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller action movie and gore fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them a must watch film if only to laugh at how bad it is 
__label__0 en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman s husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and that s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the tale telling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars belief to be fair some of sykes creative camera work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castro s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles ain t a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash i give the zombie chronicles 2 10 but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn t get to view the film with the benefit of 3d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn t have made that much of a difference 
__label__1 as it is generally known anthology films don t fare very well with american audiences i guess they prefer one standard plot line new york i love you is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities the people who live love in them the first was paris j taime which i really enjoyed the film was made up of several segments each written and or directed by a different director most of which were french but there is a very funny segment directed by joel ethan coen like paris this one is also an anthology directed by several different directors fatih akin mira nair natalie portman shakher kapur etc and also like paris deals with new yorkers and why they love the city they live in it features a top notch cast featuring the likes of natalie portman shia labeouf christina ricci orlando bloom ethan hawki and also features such seasoned veterans as james caan cloris leachman eli wallach and julie christie some of the stories really fly and others don t although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes i won t ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me which ones didn t word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai china is rome italy berlin germany or athens greece out of the question spoken mainly in english but does have bits of yiddish russian with english subtitles rated r by the mpaa for strong language sexual content
__label__0 could contain spoilers i m surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest really am all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say note to self must check the rating for platoon on here this movie was so black and white americans good anyone else either evil or useless i take it the british troops in it were meant to be sas one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with i m pretty sure they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the us troops who weren t even elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky iraqis aye dead on strings to mind the only good thing i have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the sas man muzzle flash from distance good noise used really well done that bit but the rest spare me what am i 10 years of age over here well i m not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it spoiler oh aye and in the main crazy wild guy can t stay at home with his wife and young child no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war why because young men need thrills or something apparently like say i m surprised by the high rating of this movie really am p s i m not hating america i m hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war in my eyes which ok fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it s a just war for whatever messed up reason wanted to say something else her but censored but hey that s up to them but to churn out a movie so one sided like it s black and white good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child in war there is a lot of grey and it s two sometimes more sides who believe in what they are fighting for not star wars with something something dark side verses the goodies f sake hollywood at times you really do take people for mugs then again 7 8 well maybe you are right to but i ll not be buying it glad i downloaded this movie tell you all that for nothing ;)
__label__1 actor herman josé plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the benfica club of its heart fc porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the fc port was wronged with this but what happens is that these two players after all are good and fc porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business the film for a small country as portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between north south of portugal fc porto benfica highly recommended
__label__0 it s been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy and i d forgotten just how idiotic it is i d place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presley s very worst movies presley plays joe whitecloud a half breed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the broken down shack where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez none of the three offer anything of substance comically or otherwise the government has invested in the family s cattle but they re lacking a bull elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs and is pursued by a young boy crazy gal and her gun toting mother this is just a real slapdash of a mess and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and don t make this much easier the one thing that puzzles me however is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film hard to believe considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies 
__label__1 i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web i thought cinderella 2 as well as 3 is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone kids and adults like me i am 22 years old i also find it and very informative film it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart i thought it has great animation and the voice casting was very good the songs performed by brooke allison too since this film has been divided into three flashbacks stories my favorite out of the three is the story of when jaq the mouse became a human for a day thanks to fairy godmother and her magic 
__label__0  extreme makeover home edition is yet another feel goody so called heart warming and out for ratings show that abc has had the time to put together i understand the troubles that these families go through for that i am sorry but wouldn t you think that putting four wide screen plasma televisions three flat screen desktop computers an inground pool taking up half of a backyard and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a bit too excessive for any family sure these families have been through a lot sure they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had but honestly the things that ty pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood another thing that really irks me about this show is how ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family or the family s condition telling a wheelchair bound person that he or she is so strong or very brave really does get old after a while that may sound rude but believe me watch this show and you ll see what i mean all in all this show is overrated if you want to watch it go ahead this comment is just a heads up for what you d be watching 
__label__0 i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other people s opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear i m amazed there weren t any group hug moments i think i jumped once and that s because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clichéd birds cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen and the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my mom s shawl you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my mom s shawl that didn t match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived god my friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet he s hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhop s clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and it s the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies aren t even this predictable i m gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie i m glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn t buy it for 15 00 and then hate it it was just bad it would ve been better if only one thing would ve happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that would ve been don t waste your time or money go see a good movie 
__label__1 i really really enjoyed watching this movie at first seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy but it is simply more than this i personally believe that this idea that i m sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie it s yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself or even of its marketing strategy what i mean is nowadays we are slaves to images to impressions i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression the wrong expectations and at the end i felt how superficial i could be to exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to new york and as he is asked to give an autograph meaning to sign for the ticket he believes that just because he got on tv thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity and this is just i believe the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves above this i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this illustrated throughout the movie by sidney s attitude don t become too serious about yourself or about anybody else even saints were people in the beginning as sophie once says in the movie the saints of the moment are the stars we attribute them an aura of perfection of eternal happiness but the reality is much less than that even the saints of any religion are images ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life even they were not for real they became for real after they died and we looked back at them and that s the catch we need our saints we need our stars we strive for them as if it wasn t for them we wouldn t have anything to strive for and television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings we desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves and that s how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place to see if we can fit the benchmark or if the benchmark is to small for us this time it was larger than we expected 
__label__0 after watching the first 20mn of blanche sorry i couldn t take more of it i have now confirmed she does not basically this movie is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies deux heures moins le quart avant jesus christ la folie des grandeurs a historical movie with anachronic tone dialogues this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy stigma unfortunately the horsey faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy prissy farce 
__label__1 daniel day lewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer the film however is a very difficult one to review or even watch fortunately i had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter i can t say it s the sort of film i d want to view more than once nevertheless my attention was held by the story telling device a flashback framed by the present in which we see christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him who certainly gave him loving care daniel day lewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist fiona shaw much to his mother s fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken there s a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much brenda fricker does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until day lewis begins to have success with his work she complements day lewis performance as the warm hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film both fricker and day lewis won oscars but hugh o conor and ray mcanally are also excellent o conor is christy as a boy and mcanally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy summing up elmer bernstein s music is an added plus factor well worthwhile but definitely not a film for everyone 
__label__1 i liked the movie a real lot wanted to see it just for dara tomanovich but the plot and story were ok too a very cool change in plot when you least expect it 
__label__0 title robot jox 1990 director stuart gordon cast gary graham anne marie johnson paul koslo review stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re animator from beyond dagon and castle freak took a small detour here and did a little sci fi flick i stress the word little since this is a very low budget flick and there in lies its main weakness the story takes place in the future a world in which the great superpowers that according to this movie are the united states and russia duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues well the idea is awesome i guess the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director i as a kid loved this movie and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie you ll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like what the hell is this piece of crap franco and i m like well this movie is a sci fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture i could go through it cause i loved this film as a kid and there s still a little nostalgia attached to watching it but everyone else was just not going to get it and i myself realized that the movie isn t really that good first off the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you d have to use some damn good special effects to make it work expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief but unfortunately this being a small scale movie from a small scale company empire pictures which went bankrupt after making this film the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed ok granted once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool and made me go thats why i liked thid movie but every know and them some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in and boom your right back into realizing this film just doesn t live up to its premise and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie this movie is basically a movie for kids you know giant robots duking it out stop motion animation hello but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities which really isn t a good mix so for those of you who don t feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don t have a nostalgic connection to this movie like i do well id suggest you steer clear away from this one gordons a great director but this movie he made just didn t do it for me well at least not now that i m a full grown adult rating 2 out of 5

__label__0 the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut and paste musical in the american style awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers gene kelly s french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as you ll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this can t be attributed to demy the film also has several self aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to legrand himself and the costumes well the tight pants white boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas note for instance the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg also note the convenient brunette of resolution madeleine in umbrellas and josette in young girls generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella s script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin 60s american musical will be quite happy 
__label__0 i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production i never saw the movie version until very lately on cable and watched it with anticipation to see my memories brought alive again because i adored the original show imagine my dismay this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made they changed the story they changed the songs they lost the soul i was expecting a trip down memory lane singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror at the ballet and hello twelve hello thirteen not not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point but they messed up the storyline adding songs and exterior plotlines hello cassie and michael douglas not present in the original and injecting drama where it wasn t necessary the original had enough pathos on its own if you were a fan of the original broadway show don t bother i m sorry i wasted my time and diluted my memories watching this tripe

__label__1 if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors this is the film for you seeing frank sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs michele morgan millie pico gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers leon errol cyrus drake gave a great supporting role along with victor borge sir victor fitzroy victor who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career this is not a great musical but frank sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940 s

__label__1 etienne girardot is just a character actor the sort of person people almost never would know by name however he once again plays the coroner one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once i ve already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride including grant mitchell gene lockhart henry walthal kent smith h b warner and nat pendleton this is quite an impressive cast and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b movies while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific because of the breezy writing and acting the films really satisfy as for this film vance is played wonderfully by lowe but like i said the mystery itself is only an after thought with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides unfortunately you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort i have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film i would have done it used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets overall while not the best philo vance film it was very good and it s a darn shame lowe only played this role once in fact aside from william powell who played vance five times the series was hindered by a long long succession of actors such as basil rathbone wilfred hyde white and warren william and many others playing vance this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond series just too many different actors playing the leading man well worth seeing and exciting though also quite impossible 
__label__0 let s see in the st elsewhere finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child newhart ended by telling us that it had all been a dream and roseanne ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind very creative annoying was more like it yes it was just a tv show and wasn t at all reality it s just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it s all real at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat frustrating and simply not fun to watch now newhart being all a dream at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan 
__label__1 i m gonna give it to ya straight this movie is amazing foreign gay films are so fast surpassing american gay films in production quality acting and story while so many american indie gay films are grainy bad sound amateur acting trite story lines and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica top quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france the cinematography is beautiful thought out meaningful the story is adult and complex but not difficult for anyone to follow the acting is intense and professional both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast the boys are more than just good looking and there s plenty of full frontal nudity you follow the entire year of these boys from their meeting to the end all the little nuances of a relationship s the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully performed it left me wanting more check it out 
__label__1 i saw this 25 years ago on pbs it was very difficult to watch so real to watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending no time for courting fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work this was based on the woman s actual diary which i read many years later she said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves she learned to mow which was not lady like she was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun browned calloused hands but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy to do it both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home it was so so sad when the baby died of course if they had it today i am sure it would have been fine that only makes the tragedy extra sad i was crying so hard but then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf spring is on its way and life goes on in her diary she did have two more boys and they lived 
__label__1 another in the they don t make em like that category this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean sometimes over the top fun robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings and they really took the roles and ran with them malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories both honors being eminently well deserved they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors but they ve both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here it s kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red blooded heterosexual as he does here but that s more of a personal bias than anything else but that doesn t take away from the movie s overall entertainment value which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable if you re up some night and this movie comes on i d say watch it it s well worth it 
__label__0 even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn t join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone s 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right 
__label__1 elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir yet some of the best films of the genre out of the past the killers in a lonely place night and the city manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows fedoras and femme fatales where the sidewalk ends a fairly difficult to find film the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel belongs in a category with these classics from the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixon s crumbling world and as the moments pass it inches ever closer threatening suffocation sure he s that familiar cop with a dark past but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems and yeah he s been smacking around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief karl malden in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him for the last time yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now and boy didn t they had have it coming hoods dusters mugs gutter nickel rats he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixon s right hook the advice is for him to cool off for his own good but instead he takes matters into his own hands and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before right away he s in deep with the cops the syndicate his own partner dixon s questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in like bogart in lonely place can he escape what he is when he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous gene tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor s existence into something worth coming home to the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy and all of this top notch direction and acting isn t too slick or buffed to loosen the film s emotional hold gene tierney s angelic soft focus beauty is used to great effect she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in leave her to heaven the scenes between tierney and andrews s dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self destruction near the end of his rope cut bruised and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot innocent people can get into terrible jams too he says one false move and you re in over your head perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most frighteningly due to factors you have no control over noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface where the sidewalk ends does so in a realistic fashion one nit pick of an aside this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn t seem out of place on mystery science theater how very odd but noir fans heck any movie fans who haven t seen this one are in for a terrific treat 
__label__0 to be completely honest i haven t seen that many western films but i ve seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is western asia isn t where your going finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don t get me wrong i m not racist or white either so don t get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen 
__label__0 slow slow slow there is no mystery or excitement in this film if you don t figure out who the mole is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead the secret service must have been too because it took them the whole film to put it together there are no compelling characters in the movie not film the pace of the movie is slow there is no tension the hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at michael douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass the funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending it is laugh out loud ridiculous at least six people got up and left the movie early i would have joined them if i were not sitting in the middle of the row i would not recommend this film to anyone 
__label__0 movie didn t have much plot and was uninteresting basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint also it s very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue partially because of the accents but also because words are mumbled 
__label__1  after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me whatever happened to the old burton who read the dark knight returns by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988 89 by the looks of it burton didn t research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong this movie sucks it s not as good as the original and it doesn t deal with the same subject as the original if you want a good ape movie watch the original out of stars
__label__1 pecker is another mainstream film by john waters done on a smaller than serial mom the title character of pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of anything he sees it doesn t matter if it s dirty or shocking when he takes pictures he soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work pecker live in a semi normal middle class family his dad works at a drinking bar with a claw machine but doesn t make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street his mom runs a thrift shop and loves to dress up poor people his older sister tina works at a gay bar where her specialty is trade his younger little chrissy has a habit of eating sugar sugar and nothing but sugary food his grandmother memama has a small statue of the virgin mary and plays ventriloquist with it he also has 2 friends on of his friends matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend shelley runs a laundry mat as if she was a dictator soon a tourist from new york buys his pictures and displays them at an art gallery with the picture comes fame but the pictures expose the unusual life style of his friends and family s simple life for an r rated film pecker is sure tamer than most of waters previous r rated films and even pink flamingos another 10 out of 10 
__label__1 the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring it focused on the personal problems doyle had including his sick wife death threats by fans a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle s life i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes the last 40 minutes were excellent we finally got a look inside doyle head how he created holmes and why he had to kill holmes the actors are excellent including the intriguing selden played by tim mcinnerny arthur conan doyle a compelling role played by douglas henshall and brian cox as the role model for sherlock holmes dr bell the locations are good especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece 
__label__0 frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns he was a great actor from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that but he did not have the physique of a western hero you identified him as an urban guy but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault i blame it on two factors a the story was too unusual specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern to break away from it the film has to be very good b the story is not convincing it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible why all the gunfighters have not adopted it i think that this film should not have been withdrawn because any film with sinatra is worth seeing and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
__label__0  may contain spoilers a dude in a dopey looking kong suit the same one used in king kong vs godzilla in 1962 provides much of the laffs in this much mocked monster flick kong is resurrected on mondo island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around the vampire like villain is named dr who funny he doesn t look like peter cushing kong finally dukes it out with who s pride and joy a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of magilla gorilla like many of honda s flicks this may have had some merit before american audiences diddled around with it and added new footage the rankin bass animation company had a hand in this mess they should have stuck to superior children s programs like the little drummer boy 
__label__1 i rented this movie and watched it 20 times before i took it back to the store bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists the story is original and well written powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back then spots in the present alternating back and forth this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can t get dull bill paxton please make more horror movies you have the talent for it 
__label__1 this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy meets girl movies ever made while rebel without a cause and say anything deliver nice portrayals this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it this movie is mostly all dialogue based but every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is how in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests and no matter how many times i watch this film i don t think i will ever tire of that 
__label__0 so this movie has been hailed glorified and carried to incredible heights but in the end what is it really many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work the fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated and scenes that are in asl are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent the voice interpretation of matlin s dialogue under the excuse that hurt s character likes the sound of his voice turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view but nonetheless most of the movie when this is a love story is only showed from a single point of view that of the man as ebert said if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate it s not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them the idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as revolutionary is fairly insulting in itself his character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on drawing comedy from a deaf accent is quite honestly rather low and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women as an entitled man a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated in a way that s fairly inconsistent with his credentials i have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they weren t aware of a deaf person being in the area and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to as a lover he seems like a typical dogged nice guy including his tendency to act possessively afterwards and yet the movie is indeed only really seen through him as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice the scenes involving the other deaf kids are in general wallbangers the broken symbolism fails the dance scene the pool scene even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors at best many hearing people i know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness no seriously when i go swim i go swim it also fails at carrying the end of the play instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man even though the original play ended with a more equal ground where both have to accept each other as they are and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands not the vibrations in her throat and for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be marlee matlin remains hollywood s token deaf woman to this day 
__label__0 yes this is one of those movies so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing i have watched comedies good comedies and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie the other comments give the idea well enough the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses but the rat yes the big rat why we didn t get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me often the big one isn t shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money i surmise however that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third world dentistry the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene after figuring out that the rats couldn t stand loud noise migraines from the bad acting the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy if you ve ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser this film is for you really you need to rent it and see for yourself but not for more than 99 ok 
__label__1 a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel altman creates a suspenseful gothic atmosphere but the script is weak sporting a southern drawl branagh is convincing as the lawyer and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire downey is likable as a private detective duvall has a small role which does not allow him to do much with his weird character hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast after an interesting setup the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise but altman is always worth a look 
__label__1 i don t like grade inflation but i just had to give this a 10 i can t think of anything i didn t like about it i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it i m sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about with j lo and richard gear will be excellent but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought provoking for me that i am hard pressed to think of any way that it could be improved or its setting changed to a different culture a story i found worth watching and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort imagine that all the characters seemed well developed even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting and the casting seemed very appropriate it s always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age and perhaps this doesn t quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance but no singing but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man successful with a family in japan looking for something he knows not precisely what to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film thank you for creating and doing it 
__label__0 every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can t stand or never watched all the way through this is the movie that i think of days later it s got something to do with a play by shakespeare not sure but i think i bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it think i realised that my toenails wouldn t clip themselves and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut this movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me even though this is the first movie i ve given such a low score to which i ve actually attempted to watch i wouldn t want to put you off other movies by it s english director peter greenaway i remember thinking that his the cook the thief his wife and her lover was a truly great british film even though its content was at times stomach churning a brilliant movie but i can understand why people would balk at seeing it another good film by greenaway was a zed and two noughts again it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste but was intriguing nonetheless the other film that i usually think of too late for such radio show topics is brazil never managed to watch that all the way through either kept falling asleep unless you have a taste for self important movies which are off puttingly highly stylised laboriously paced and difficult to follow then steer clear of prosero s books

__label__0 who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists what s intended to be a light frothy comedy about neighbor children who can t give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self indulgence as children the pair are unbearably precocious as adults they re intolerably immature it s a bad combination 
__label__0 how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back i love gwen paltrow but it was like she was on the wrong set i like most chick flicks but i hated this one this is the only time i saw so much clevage and was not turned on those outfits were way overdone no one talks that way anymore and i don t think they even did then the dancing part was horrible my ex said to me later didn t ya like that part didn t ya think it was sensous i said yes only to spare her feelings now i know why we never married this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen 
__label__1 i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990 a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect it is a true gem the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever if you see this movie for rent in a video store steal it you won t regret it

__label__0 this movie was just terrible the first movie wasn t that great i mean it s ridiculously stupid if they didn t have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond i ll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink i don t understand was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn t be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film please no more of these movies 
__label__1 i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn t know about this website and i didn t realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can t tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt the episode where starsky kill starsky almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show what to you expect of a kid at age 12 now i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i m so there just got to say happy birthday paul 
__label__1 two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension one brian thompson as a kabal trying to destroy the earth the other jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid trying to save it doctor mordrid is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent but the film is very short and entertaining so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look my rating 7 out of 10 
__label__1 even longtime shirley fans may be surprised by now and forever the movie was filmed with paramount studios not with shirley s parent company twentieth century fox in 1934 before fox producer darryl zanuck had perfected the successful shirley formula cute songs cold hearts for her to melt young couples for her to play cupid to happy endings thus now and forever falls into the category of a shirley vehicle without the standard shirley story it is an awkward position for any movie but this impressive talented cast makes it work gary cooper and carole lombard star as fun loving irresponsible con artists jerry and toni day the only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart when they are suddenly landed with custody of jerry s young daughter penny shirley temple it is toni and not penny as many believe who persuades jerry to give up his criminal career but jerry flounders at his desk job and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty in a standard shirley device penny tries to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon felix evans the victim of one of jerry s cons but her attempt fails for evans is revealed to be a con artist himself and he blackmails jerry into helping him steal jewels the drama gunfight death and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for little miss sunshine there is no happy ending no dancing and only one song sequence the cute number the world owes me a living but this does not mean that shirley fans should avoid now and forever rather it s divergence from the usual shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films but beware you should avoid colorized version of this film and see it in black and white if you can the color is bright garish and unrealistic and in many scenes shirley s famous curls are actually red instead of blonde yikes 
__label__0 this movie looks like it was made for tv for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter because i loved to see him box at the old msg and to see this movie was very disappointing i have alot of respect for mr washington but he was awful and boring there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song 
__label__1 the 74th oscars was a very good one whoopi s work as emcee was very funny and light i personally loved her last apperance which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes but that s fine the audience seemed to like it halle berry denzel washington ron howard woody allen and sidney poitier made this an oscar telecast to remember 
__label__0 director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past like greedy and clue this isn t one of them more akin to a police academy film than its inspiration it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act nothing much happens really it s all quite dull it s not very funny martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they re all better than this and it s quite painful watching them work with such thin material 
__label__1 the best film about marriage and family this is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family this decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids the real intrusion or help of friends or executioner if we leave the real role of families they can help or they can destroy us the mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality a couple who thinks in a special marriage live a painful story in their future own history who likes contract marriage nobody after the priest tells their own history if they leave the future in another hands if they don t know what is the marriage that the problems are true that the life demand a real engage guaranties from each one that the real victims of the divorce are kids with real name andrea in the film or names that the abortion is only an easy exit sadness regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion that the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families the gossip of the friends the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of steffania because tomasso lives his life as if he were alone maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film but not steffania and tomasso in the deep of their hearts they like a beautiful marriage and family if not why they like marriage a truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple of each one of their decisions of each one actions in their lives the family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her only by existing the screenplay is wonderful the performances are great steffania and tomasso the almost cynical priest an excellent direction and script the colors and the management of the cameras superb 
__label__1 the film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong the very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining it is the sort of story that the director bill paxton could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with it from beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next it demonstrates just how far people can go so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of god when they are disillusioned as in this case it also is sometimes interesting in its twists takes on the concept of morality as a whole overall this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out it is very much so worth your time 
__label__1 this movie is about sexual obsession bette davis plays mildred this is a woman who men are drawn to not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her she works as a waitress in a coffee shop she can t read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it he dreams about her like she is a angel but she is no angel he is constantly thinking about her his med school grades are even failing so what the nookie is too good he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy she always lets phil know she really doesn t have love feelings for him all of time he is heart broken but he meets another woman they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed phillip takes her in again but she starts going out with a friend of his the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him well it doesn t work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred well he has no school tuition can t find a job finally sally and her dad takes him in not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again she has tb meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally i wished she told him to stuff it now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points but i feel phillip was the bad guy yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it and he keeps coming back mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers i guess the sex wasn t as good but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby apparently the baby s name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy sally s father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist philip doesn t seem to refute his feelings either men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred 
__label__1 as the story in my family goes my dad milton raskin played the piano for the dorsey band after sinatra joined the band my dad practiced with him for hours on end then at a point in time my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group band and that he should venture off on his own by that time sinatra had enough credits under his belt to do just that dorsey never forgave my dad and the rest as they say is history i have some pictures and records to that effect and so does berkley university in california i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say and his movies never get old thank you frank
__label__1 absolutely the very first film that scared me to death i happened catch it when my older brother r i p was watching it it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested shortly after my folks bought a color set and as luck would have it the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday i had forgotten most of the plot but it did not take long to catch up and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space but you could not hear it or see it and once it got hold of you it was too late even now after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine a true classic and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation long live the blob 
__label__1 who would ve imagined hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style the fusion is highly entertaining having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade i approached this one with some caution his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog the director s earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life often in the region of long island new york or in new york city itself that were offbeat and insightful my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a spy thriller to my pleasant surprise hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue it works in more ways than one might imagine hartley s film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks along with a singular cinematographic style moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides hartley has brought all his skills to something new a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana truly he is coming into his own the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley s vision and style fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before 
__label__0 when watching little man you ll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy your supposed to be laughing at it but will you probably not the main problem with little man is its concept its far too ridiculous to accept even as a cartoonish comedy so when the loud laboured and over the top jokes kick in they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is but its a comedy some of you might be screaming thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot i mean come on think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face wouldn t you be the least bit suspicious and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly why didn t he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man i mean seriously what its not about the plot its about the laughs you might be screaming well heres the thing see there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs what ever you do steer clear of little man 
__label__0 this film was done in really poor taste the script was really bad i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b movie adaptation of one of history s greatest generals the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 there was a scene where i almost vomited it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded one legged filipino soldier the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says no papa no mama no uncle sam and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans would never abandon the philippines the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur s words and gives him a smart salute i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u s as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe united states armed forces of the far east these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war 2 who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous i shall return speech my late grandfather a filipino world war 2 veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the leyte gulf landing 
__label__0 okay as a long time disney fan i really hate direct to video disney sequels walt himself didn t believe in them he believed in and they lived happily ever after being the end of it but this one really ticked the taco there were so many ripoffs of other disney films in this it wasn t funny quick summary if you don t already know melody the daughter of ariel and prince eric is born ursula s sister morganna who basically looks like ursula if she were to dye herself green and go on the ally macbeal starvation diet shows up and after trying to do the newborn tyke in and failing prophesizes doom for the characters after that ordeal ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid heritage and later on forbids her to go near the sea well surprise surprise melody finds out being the stubborn brat she is and runs away then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid in exchange for something gee does that sound familiar she becomes one but in her half of the bargain has to retrieve her granddaddy s trident and bring it back to the sea witch while doing this she runs into a couple of outcast animals a penguin and a walrus named timon and pumb huh wait no that s not timon and pumbaa or is it could of fooled me anyway i d like to reveal more but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does ok so long story short this movie borrows too much from other better disney films and does it horribly come on tip and dash why not just make dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff ugh not to mention the total character butchery of ariel s persona she s gone from being a freespirited headstrong woman to a clone of her father not good at all they re basically telling us the sweet firey little mermaid we ve known to grow and love is dead plus melody herself isn t such a great character either she s damned annoying and bratty not to mention what they ve done to flounder ugh anyway if you decide to see this piece of created mainly for profit reasons no imagination eisner sponsored c t i suggest maybe waiting till its on the disney channel or some other tv station because it s not even worth the price of a rental out of stars 
__label__1 i m a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies a lot of silent films don t hold my attention but show people is a notable exception marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film i know that doesn t make much sense but that s what happened the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary show people is a perfect introduction to silent films it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent era s best stars add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the must see list for all classic film buffs 
__label__0 actually they don t but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is there were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities and don t get me started on the bad the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but i will recap them here in case anyone cares anyone who hasn t seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point the first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with freddy s long lost child now the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is hereditary so why not a mystery type slasher in which lisa zane s character dreams of freddy murdering the teens only we later discover it s actually her doing all the killing sound like a good plot idea to you obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de luca then there s the trip to springfield where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis funnily enough said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one s comprehension and control the essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror show of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless they re the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in that in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with freddy s dead it just doesn t try at all leave alone hard enough on a related note i feel kind of sorry for robert englund now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character he has played far better characters in far better productions the science fiction miniseries v for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played freddy is selling him rather short it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now as for the rest of the cast well i think their performances here speak for themselves they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than b grade horror props even yaphet kotto doesn t escape this one unscathed as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of b films all in all freddy s dead gets a 1 out of me i d vote lower but the imdb doesn t allow for that fd is really a testament to how a writer s inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise 
__label__0 may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent with this said soul survivors was a very very bad movie very bad i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script affleck is a very talented actress wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty melissa sagemiller did well and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood i don t think any of the actors really got into the script and i understand why to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement it did have the twists and turns you would expect but they just didn t lead anywhere except to more confusion i just found the ending very anti climatic because it just didn t seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline i wish i could give this movie a good review but i can t in all honesty the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it 
__label__1 good times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the chicago projects whether or not you live in the inner cities ghettos suburbs or rural countryside this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family but they don t dwell on it they find humor and have strong family values and morals despite the story behind the scenes this show was worth keeping on the air except i didn t like them killing off the father which i agreed with esther rolle who fought hard to keep the family together but despite all the fights behind the scenes good times was a show about a family we all loved jj s dynamite and his antics we watched janet jackson s penny grow up a little this show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs gangs and alcoholism without being to preachy the evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto 
__label__0 i want to start by stating i am a republican even though i don t agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office and i love the daily show and colbert report they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv i enjoy the bush jokes on conan letterman leno because i admit that w is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth i do believe he s not the dumbest either but it comes to a point when enough is enough and it s not really that funny anymore i see where it can be funny and it is hey he s making fun of our authority figure he s hilarious comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him i mean maybe one special episode but an entire series is just dumb it seems cc is just saying the same bush jokes that we ve heard way to many times i really cannot see this show going past 1 season 
__label__0 devin hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary full moon entertainment sadly his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years however in his short career hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories now this doesn t mean that his movies are good but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre in his debut bleed hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre maddy debbie rochon is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams not only that but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in shaun danny wolske it seems that life finally smiles for maddy after many sad events until on a party with shaun s friends they tell her that they created a club where members have to kill somebody to enter obviously they are joking but maddy wants desperately to fit in that she actually murders someone after that event someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the club one by one it is up to maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer including her maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful debbie rochon it is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects the concept is so original and rochon s performance is so good that it is a real shame that hamilton didn t develop the whole story a little bit better the movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie the rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good while the male cast is painfully bad danny wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical julie strain brinke stevens lloyd kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles also there is lots of nudity both male female and the cast is very good looking so it is really a plus the low budget hurts the film in the effects department as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic probably because they would look bad nevertheless considering the budget the film at least looks good hamilton s more recent effort the sexploitational venture delta delta die is a better crafted and overall funnier film while this one is not as bad as other better known films it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of debbie rochon or fans of independent no budget films 4 10
__label__0 this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it if you take the first movie and reverse the plot ariel wants to leave the sea her daughter wants to go to the sea take the same characters and give them new animals and new names and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor possible you get the little mermaid 2 its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot i ll take you through the horror of it step by step these are the people from the 1st movie first of all prince eric is still prince eric with about 3 lines in the whole movie ariel is uptight annoying and is not the carefree headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st in fact she is the exact opposite sebastian is still sebastian only less cute less convincing as being stressed out and the jokes just aren t funny anymore flounder has about 2 lines he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny king triton s character is probably the best he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter melody ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter like i said all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them this is what they did ursula the new evil villain is morgana ursula s sister who feels like she always lived in ursula s shadow i wouldn t be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife she can t do anything right and she s a failure as a villain she has the same voice ursula did sebastian flounder have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks tip dash a walrus and a penguin they try to be hero s but always fail when trying the plot is so predictable they become heroes at the end yawn flatson jetsom now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton hes really bad too morgana and the shark sharkbait i think was his name have no chemistry good or bad ariel ah ariel our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un lovely daughter melody melody cannot sing her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet she wants to go to the sea she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her she has to go find herself yawn not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original basically comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca don t ever watch this not even when your bored 
__label__0 i have to say i was very curious on viewing this film and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th century fox in 1970 it has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films and this only deepened an interest as i just had to see what made this movie so bad upon seeing it i think i have my answers although i will say it does make for curious viewing the acting direction and script are so laughingly bad that the supposed satire is completely missing racquel welch seems to try to carry the film but after the opening sequence of the sex change operation the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone john huston as uncle buck loner is certainly no help as he licks and leers at the screen he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he s doing there rex reed bounces around as myron myra s alter ego and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene bravo for debut performances farrah fawcett plays a dumb blonde she certainly seemed convincing in this role but of course arguably the most notorious role went to mae west the sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film i don t mean to put this cast down personally but in this film no one comes out looking good the direction seems so unassured and non existent that the film is not only bad but boring as well throw in some old film footage of old stars and the movie becomes even more disconnected to each his own to anyone that enjoyed this and i was glad i at least saw it but myra breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning 
__label__1 i saw this movie when i was about 8 years old and i liked it but it wasn t until i watched it again at the age of 13 that i really understood it for what it is a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold adopts a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals the dog star charlie b barkin is murdered by his formal business partner carface who is absolutely diabolical by the way his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life s time which charlie being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds sending him back to earth once back on earth charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface this is how he comes upon young anne marie the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface but scoundrel charlie actually comes to care for young anne marie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after anne marie discovers what her best friend charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino now he must rescue her from the dreaded carface i still love this movie even at the age of 22 the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain 
__label__1 well what can i say this movie really got to me it s not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn t first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack bryan adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didn t give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but i don t know making animals talk is just so lame one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing :)
__label__1 i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just dies but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can t hate it some spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence 3 the emperor now that s evil 4 the speeders chase at the endor forest 5 the last battle 6 the dark side seduction scene 7 the return of anakin to the good side of the force 8 and the last celebration some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 but still is extraordinary 9 out of 10 
__label__1 a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show s stars kitty carlisle and carl brisson as well as starring in the infamous sweet marijuana number which was also on a 70s bette midler album so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman we quickly learn that the maid dorothy stickney loves brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady jessie ralph is brisson s mother and that the stage manager jack oakie butts into everything lots of plots twists among the musical numbers the show s best known song is cocktails for two kitty carlisle also sings the haunting where do they come from and there s a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington quite the cast some terrific acting here especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney kitty carlisle is quite good as well brisson is a total zero though charles middleton plays homer toby wing plays nancy donald meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls 
__label__1 i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didn t have high hopes for it i figured it was another you got served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this to my surprise the acting wasn t bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you don t spend too much i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones go see the movie and judge for yourself hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1 
__label__1 spoilers i saw the original on tv sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most beeb costume drama i rewatched on dvd this week and still have the same impression of it it s a good story at first but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he s ill and i got so totally irritated with her saintliness i suppose this was the right thing to do when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as i expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see but it s hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone so re the story as in the film i m equivocal it s well done as per the novel but somewhat irritating as per today s kind of life steadfast hero gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove s variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self denial and to be so consistently supportive so i felt it a great shame that when helen was at long last free to be with him the script didn t allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up this was completely ridiculous when we d been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine instead the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn t be bothered here you are one minute do what you can in that then cut as the director wants to go home now i was left feeling totally dissasatisfied however very high commendations to the acting of toby stephens a perfect and very handsome hero and rupert graves a superbly nasty and self pitying villain tara fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time that said i love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the modern drama on tv these days so 7 stars because in spite of the irritations it s still a good watch 
__label__1 many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path murder most foul gathering of clues gaggle of possible perps sprinkling of red herrings and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver forgotten abandons the well trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly tied package might frustrate some but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes disturbs and haunts with the question what does an evil person look like excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten 
__label__0 this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot the entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner another girl that s right they re lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through also unfortunately none of this is ever explained where exactly were they where did the demon come from how did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit the acting is terrible i think but it s hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it i give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap i would not recommend it it wasn t quite bad enough to be funny 
__label__1 not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994 but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80 s backwoods slasher the plot goes 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida but they re plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes that he was seen well let s just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80 s especially the late 80 s which was when the slashers kinda went downhill this was one of the few that didn t and this movie should be more well known it s a pity it isn t this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes just try guessing who the final girl is going to be i got it totally wrong the principle cast are all likable and it s one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away which of course they don t this coupled with the fluffiness of the film s first half an hour jars in a good way with some flashes of real nastiness the second murder provides a real jolt and some unexpected sleaziness even though this isn t a high budget thriller i didn t expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast in a film from this late in the 80 s there are one or two bad things about this movie well not bad just minor like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn t go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic there aren t any sharp implements in shallow grave but to my mind at least it s a slasher flick through and through the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff 
__label__0 this movie had so much potential anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it s ridiculous too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption where was the character development the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer but fail to address the major point in dahmer s development also the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh etc i could go on but to sum up too many lagging points in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is dahmer 
__label__0 one of the silliest movies of the 1940s an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser kyer orchestra leader and radio star and eternal college fraternity goof off was sort of the precursor to spike jones hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians he s hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall the shindig is beset with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous swami lots of giggly females and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures the songs by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer are nothing to brag out and neither is over confident kyser yukking it up with elbow in the ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years from 
__label__1 the shining is a weird example of adaptation it has very little in common with the source novel written by stephen king yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master s work this is due to two factors stanley kubrick s masterful direction and jack nicholson s chilly acting nicholson plays jack torrance a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family jack his wife wendy shelley duvall and their five year old son danny danny lloyd the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something s wrong he has been told by the cook dick o hallorann scatman crothers that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy the titular shining which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny even though he is quite capable of resisting them that is not jack s case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife s affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasn t hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths king criticized the director for changing most of the story omitting most of the jack danny subplot merely hinted at in the film that led to the book s emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the omission was actually necessary the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme kubrick one of the most famous analysts of human decay never had a soft spot for what he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical unbalance that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot danny s encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writer s opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story now it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that martin sheen king s ideal choice for the role probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson s from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal here s johnny scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn t bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo s nest star as for duvall and lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens the omen s damien and haley joel osment as cinema s great horror child icons one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart blonde and beautiful and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered a back in 1980 the scream queen cliché wasn t one yet b rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the book movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy s eyes irvine welsh the author of trainspotting once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work and he should know given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen yet that doesn t mean the movie is necessarily bad the shining proves said point to perfection very little from the novel approximately 5 is included in the film but in kubrick and nichlolson s hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the genre s current poor form 
__label__1 i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that s never happened before a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael douglas character pete garrison they think he s the mole but he isn t he s just a morally flawed agent having an affair with the first lady since he s doing that he s unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it s revealed there is a plot to kill the president garrison is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he s still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president douglas does a fine job in this role i don t always care the people he plays but he s an excellent actor keifer sutherland david breckinridge is equally as good at least in here as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop if they can the plot the crooks are interesting too by the way also i have never and never will unfortunately see a first lady who looks as good as kim basingerthis is simply a slick action flick that entertains start to finish are there holes in it of course probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments however it is unfairly bashed here it just isn t intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website my advice chill just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue yes it gets a little rambo ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment which is what movies are all about 
__label__1 this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more crawford stars a young rich girl who s father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother they have never worked before and the brother william bakewell gets a job with gable who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on their is a massacre in which several of gable s men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing it s a good movie but not one of their best 
__label__1 the japanese cyber punk films have never really done a whole lot for me but of the handful that i ve seen most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining meatball machine is no exception the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts takes control of their bodies turns them into necroborgs and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other apparently as a game for the enjoyment of said parasites the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other but whose love affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites and are forced to fight each other it becomes a test of human will vs the parasite s control over their physical bodies meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo as most cyber punk films are and for good reason there are definitely some thematic parallels though the films are definitely different there s plenty of fun splattery moments in meatball machine and the creature borg fx are definitely the high point a mixture of tetsuo meets gwar that are both elaborate and inventive depending on your taste for these types of films meatball machine may or may not be your thing if you enjoy hyper kinetic cyber punk films with a healthy dose of splatter this one s for you 7 10
__label__1 i was pleased with the cast of reputable players the story is one of standing up for a cause even if you are at personal risk in doing so in a time where violence and pain are often in the movie forefront this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop although similar plots have been done repeatedly these guys pull it off well kick back and enjoy dennehy is a master of taking over a movie 
__label__0 this show had a lot of hype but i didn t know about it until the midseason season 1 someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the show s format i m happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed he s in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie and for some reason sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it even though she s sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesn t do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didn t care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldn t have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookie s grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jason then once sookie and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots tara s mother wants an exorcism then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasn t so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his grandmother s stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal he s only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her subtlety is not this show s strong suit it doesn t take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my assumption wasn t dead on it wasn t that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn t possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked lady s face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout as if that wasn t enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then it s time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the penultimate episode it s revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they shove renee being the killer in your face sookie remarks that it s odd that renee s thoughts don t have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to renee being a fraud but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of renee s boxes about how to fake a cajun accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie who still manages to kill renee they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church which makes me care about him even less it s almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better i m interested in seeing what happens in season 2 but if i watch it i ll most likely wait for the season completion 
__label__0 this film was pure pain sitting in the theater for x amount of minutes i was wondering when the film was going to start all the setups were in place typical love story characters have to overcome their short givings villain has to emerge but none of it ever initiated by the time these things happened i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective in scenes that required immense tension and buildup it felt like necessary frames were cut kid s stuff does not have to be this way children s films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones the excuse hey its for kids is bull i ll take sword in the stone any day this was terrible i m getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days and as for the kids the 10 year i saw this with will agree pure trash 
__label__1 no i m not joking around if you ever ever have the chance to see this movie see it if you need chop off your arm to see it see it it s worth it fatty drives the bus is unlike any film you ve ever seen it takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art while it contains poor shots idiotic characters bad dialogue strange acting and cinematography that belongs on public access in iowa it actually succeeds in its goal as a film it strives to be the dumbest strangest most inane movie you ve ever seen and boy does it ever succeed i will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things the filmmakers obviously didn t but really you needn t pay too much attention because the entire film s plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits in any event fdtb as its admirers call it is the story of a bus tour through chicago which is led by satan you see jesus is in town and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die and all their souls would have gone to hell except with jesus in town a lackey in hell calls off the job and this angers satan because well he doesn t like looking like a fool in front of the guy so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly but he s a devil so he needs to disguise himself otherwise who d go on a tour with him right so he disguises himself as roger and he gets on the bus where the driver is never referred to by name but he is kind of fat so i guess he s fatty the bus and the riders are on a collision course with wackiness examples of some lunacy the title repeats on the screen 3 times i don t know why a character appears on the bus in mid trip without explanation or introduction and occassionally sits next to the others and they look at her like she doesn t belong i don t know why two characters fall in love and exchange longing glances that are really the same shots repeated over and over again i don t know why after satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes satan is going to transform i don t know why one character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag and is referred to by other characters as the glamorous bridget i don t know why if there was one good thing that came out of my internship at troma last summer it was getting my own copy of fatty drives the bus 
__label__1 this movie will not sit well with some but it is a must view i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as other african americans moved in minor spoilers this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint you have an african american male danny glover who worked his way hard through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970 s like any american he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot there was still alot of problems going on the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids one owning a home wow then the blending in began his wife whoopi goldberg is told to get involved so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do and just when the man thinks he and his family are in right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the lotto mo nique and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesn t want the neighborhood to think they are alike he of course is of a better calibre his new neighbor is ghetto not an shouldn t be there who s got a problem now what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in and how they lose themselves in the process it makes you question where does racism begin and end and with whom it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you it also shows how these african american children when blending in neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture complete with blonde hair and blue eyes mind you around them they laugh along with the jokes not knowing they are the joke and not knowing why but overall this film is about people no matter what race you are this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other all for the sake of fitting in all because you feel you have more money than others so that automatically makes you better and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you again not for everyone but take a look and judge for yourself 
__label__1 i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynch s twin peaks a show which i adore the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show probably not through its own fault as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got the acting is excellent and this show has some of the best characters good and evil in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time there is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic but this is rectified as the season progressed well worth a watch definitely something out of the ordinary 
__label__1 i saw this movie today and i have to say it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it but it did totally change my idea the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it this really touched me and as a film which is based on a true story it convinced me a new school psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn t seem to work out it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations also i think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened before i spoil this movie with praises i have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn t look and feel realistic like the one where the headmaster of the school beat frits aka martin in front of the class at the end of the movie he really got beaten badly but the only thing that it caused to him was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning when frits got some stitches well i guess every movie has it own faults have to say that if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store it s sure thing that i take it with me 
__label__1 it is a tricky thing to play a queen on the one hand the actress has to be majestic and imperious and on the other she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria but it s not as full a performance as i d like no blame to her i can t help but feel like this is a mills boon novel adaptation compared to a darker more dramatic movie about another young queen elizabeth hence blunt doesn t get to run the gamut of queenly emotions at least not to the full extent since she s y know the young victoria to see the old victoria check out mrs brown jean marc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie he last did c r a z y which was excellent and propelled him to fame it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that s probably the main similarity between the two movies but while vallee wrote c r a z y this one was by julian fellowes and though i really enjoyed his gosford park the story for this movie was much less interesting i soon got lost with all the governmental politics maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy i m just saying 
__label__1 i saw two movies over the weekend one was kaal and the other waqt both movies are made in bollywood but they are worlds apart the fundamental difference is the story and the director vipul shaw made his indelible mark with ankhen one of the best comedy hindi movies his casting of the charecteres is perfect the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome the treatment is superb with some exceptions in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy mediocre malik in this instance is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandma s who just cant get enough of these numbers no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat natyam the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like kaal to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art and they surround themselves with borderline talent and they recoup the investment before the word gets around these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner film farce awards given by bollywood chamcha s and most of them are in the media 
__label__1 when i learned of sir alec guinness death this was the first of his many films i thought of re seeing what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites 
__label__1 ella was excellent franchot was unavoidably over the top but he played similar parts in other films such as the man on the eiffel tower and alan was nearly non existent but the film certainly thrilled mild spoiler ahead i wonder how many times elisha cook got strangled in his films but i seem to recall various other examples i will avoid naming the murderer but i think it s necessarily obvious because of the plot thriller demands a very well done but dated film noire for example everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters and no dead bodies were ever shown unlike today s gore fests done in the familiar short scene tableaux format of the period 8 out of 10 
__label__1 terry gilliam s stunning feature length adaptation of chris marker s short film la jetee is full of mind bending surprises yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast gilliam s flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole willis at his most steve mcqueen like better than mcqueen even a time traveling convict from the future who literally doesn t know whether he s coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that s deadly to humans but harmless to animals willis the justifiably oscar nominated brad pitt and madeline stowe as a well meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers even paul buckmaster s tango style score is haunting this one s a don t miss 
__label__1  some spoilers i have not read the james m cain novel the postman always rings twice on which this movie was based so i cannot compare this film version to it but i have seen and love the 1946 us version also entitled postman even better is this gem from italy which i have read was mutilated in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime well no matter what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the forerunner of the neo realist movement in film making one can certainly see why despite whatever harsh editing did go on a pervading sense of societal and cultural as well as personal oppression remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in life consider gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and resorting to stowing away stealing and conning people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless in giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the trattoria for her husband slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex in the past she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurant gas station owner giuseppe bregana played by juan de landa anyway knowing that he would not make her happy she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact pocketed gino wins bregana s favor promising also to fix the broken water pump water symbolizing life or lack thereof and is left alone with giovanna they immediately start a heated passionate yet volatile love affair gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband wanting no part of it gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsy type man named spagnolo a fellow train passenger to gino spagnolo represents a sort of freedom and they become friends spagnolo also symbolizes gino s morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together finally gino has steady employment to his dismay he is not yet over his love for giovanna a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go back home to live and work with them again as he is handy to have around too weak willed to resist knowing this will reunite he and giovanna gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple after a while he gives in to gina s demands to get rid of her husband once the evil deed is done giovanna becomes more cold blooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm as much as he wants to leave her he does again briefly they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino s life to act as a judge of his misdeeds that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the story while the 46 u s version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters especially the cops and the lawyers ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone this gives the final outcome even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live a minor quibble the amount of time hardly any that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no botched first attempt as in the u s version gino s very quick to escalate relationship with the dancer hooker they quickly profess their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met all rather unrealistic isn t it i found this time frame problem quite distracting it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere otherwise well worth the viewer s time the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout recommended 
__label__0 i will admit that i m only a college student at this present time an english major at that at the time i saw this film i was a high school student i want to say junior year but it may have been senior hard to remember my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like i m not a phd by any means that said this movie is simply terrible it s designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is my mother is such a person and ever since she s seen this movie she s tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i d seen with the films logic and science and they are numerous and she dismissed my claims because oh so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds in this case apparently so leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn t necessarily require that a person be correct or in fact intelligent leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film leaving that behind the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when in fact he completely opposed them i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so http www intuitor com moviephysics bleep html
__label__0  cause they re both pretty lousy i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture rip someone to bloody pieces and calmly re enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened now you know a movie s in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention i admit i paid 30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie i know what you re thinking 30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole and you would be absolutely correct this movie sucks there it s right out in the open i was expecting some actual scares and i waited and waited and waited none came the raven probably a crow in makeup didn t scare me seeing small pieces of internal organs didn t scare me and even faye didn t scare me i m not that brave i know so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble what s more jennifer wasn t scared either her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything her life was rapidly coming to a close and she s worried about attaining more money honey you can t take money where you re going i need money she continually says completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function meanwhile i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother faye i was suspicious at first faye playing a grandmother and all and i was still suspicious at the end there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother from hell are forced to share temporarily and i m guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother here s the weird part the relative looks like she s just endured her eight hundredth birthday party mary ellen looks like she s just gotten a face lift from a renowned surgeon face lifts can t work miracles but i think faye s appearance is important to the rice paper plot spoiler it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting sorry my little joke seriously though there s all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate yuck huh interestingly enough mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact how did she avoid the family curse something s up with her obviously another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars this movie features one of my all time movie pet peeves i refer to the double ending this movie ends twice i absolutely hate it when that happens and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending didn t like it and forget to remove it during editing i guess it s supposed to be scary but it is only if you re a film editor there is one perk to this debacle though and it s one of the reasons i bought the dvd the filmmaker commentary features faye dunaway and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn t have lines to recite guess what the movie sucked so bad i wasn t able to sit through it again drat

__label__1 this is a pretty decent example of film noir the setting is the early 50 s with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a list about him the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film an unlikeable anti hero that is not very normal jean peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stool pigeon the plot had its fair share of twists and turns wisecracks and tough talk there is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and exciting i think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film for non noir viewers it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone 
__label__0 dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise a young mafia would to be killer chandler must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to california to take some lessons with a very known professional killer beluschi first and most important task to kill a young woman lee that is a completely strange for all of them but is she a easy target the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie good performance by chandler i give this a 4 four 
__label__0 first off with names like fred olen ray brinke stevens and jan michael vincent plus distributors like rhino and troma on the video box you know what you re getting into with this one b movie mania if you re actually expecting to see a thriller based on edgar allan poe then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films this is pure unadulterated sleaze with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to the premature burial complete with lots of r rated ready for video sex and nudity however it s certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way brinke who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes plays rich traumatized insomniac housewife victoria monroe whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father hoke howell her worthless husband terry jay richardson has racked up some serious gambling debt owed to a gangster played by robert quarry and with help from his kinky blonde european accented sexpot secretary lisa delia sheppard plots to do away with brinke for her money name value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist she s way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this 50s sci fi horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still living vicki jan michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home the kill a spouse for the inheritance plot has been done a million times before the ending is an unintentional laugh riot concluding with a direct rip off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here 
__label__0 didn t care for the movie the book was better does anyone know where it was filmed this was my first visit to your site just found the answer to my question so now i look like a dummy but i think i ll still submit my comments and yes british columbia is lovely or why they took it from its south carolina coastal setting this question stands the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie oh i just read where i need to write at least ten lines here s my other main issue with the film kim bassinger was too vapid and not at all what i pictured from the book i know the book was the book and the movie well not so good i found the character in the book much more empathetic also the book evoked rustic almost primitive images of the monastery while the castle in the film was much more visually impressive it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters 
__label__0 mt little sister and i are self proclaimed horror movie buffs we have seen just about everything especially zombie flicks now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever zombie make up was the worst i have seen if you can even call it make up black eye shadow around the eyes this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it s cover cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying this movie sucks don t waste your time return now hahahhaa i don t want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie i don t even know how it got the ratings that it did t should be in the negative
__label__1 love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don t rent it buy it now 
__label__1 this comment does contain spoilers there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma panache and swagger it s the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at clooney s subtle touches in scenes like his one word good bye to andy garcia in ocean s 11 when they just utter each other s name disdainfully terry danny you can pick any number of jack s performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee s film of the same name you can see that there is no finer an actor working today i don t mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel s work but he is definitely the cog of the production i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor played very reservedly by christopher walken is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita i don t know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the film s entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better i am interested to see how his next film domino turns out i think scott is one of today s under rated directors and with more films like this one his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita and vis ca versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad he is not around much he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it s not just a friendship between them it is more of a kinship and a deep parental love seems to be present the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead he becomes a literal man on fire it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance denzel s anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita s violation this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind also what is paramount to this film s audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful the perpetrators here feel creasy s wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 now that it is out on dvd my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks 10 10
__label__0 this film is a pia zadora special when viewing it i was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a hollywood starlet in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for b movie or soft porn roles who says at her casting session well of course i do not normally do roles requiring nudity but if it is artistically necessary for the film this recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing pia at such a session saying well of course i do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol this is probably grossly unfair the rather sordid tale is the fault of harold robbins book considering the nature of the story pia s exposures certainly do not receive undue attention and perhaps pia who once won an acting award in butterfly is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing but this is grossly unfair the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties the real problem with the lonely lady is that the screenplay like the original book looks for sensation rather than substance and nothing can help with this the screenplay for this film is abysmal but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement as it was released my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether i am assessing my personal opinion or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing my personal rating for it would be two out of ten but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable being in a charitable mood and wanting to make it clear that i am not blaming pia for my disappointment i will give an imdb rating of four 
__label__1 although this was obviously a low budget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of walken s few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great children s story and very likable characters 
__label__1 i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off it s a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook cosimo played by luis guzman who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison while in prison he meets a lifer who tells him of the ultimate bellini which to you and me is a sure fire get rich quick scheme it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop which could net millions sounds simple well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos bellini lead by failed boxer pero superbly played by sam rockwell surely a star in the making and reluctant crook riley william h macy who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud based on the italian film i soliti ignoti big deal on madonna street which also inspired a similar film to collinwood palookaville this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker 
__label__0 this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of 0 10 the acting is awful even what some here have lauded the carpathia character the script looks like it was written in haste in one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by buck what dan7 in the computer graphic meant said daniel 7 chapter 24 he probably meant verse 24 but the film makers missed this slip up perhaps the worst part is that the film s eschatological position is biblically unsound while many christians have espoused the film s interpretation of end time events such interpretation in my opinion is faulty to understand these flaws read christians will go through the tribulation by jim mckeever and the blessed hope a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture by george e ladd 
__label__0 the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the bible the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple here s why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch 1 you don t know what s going on 2 there are barely any fights 3 the fights that are there are short and terribly filmed sonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious it s only for them that i give the bodyguard a 2nd star out of 10 this movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours 
__label__1 i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england i ve seen hundreds of films since but i ve never forgotten this one although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he did nt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad i d never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this film i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character also i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatra s blue shirt 
__label__1 how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie all when it comes to actually scaring people this movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie it is the best of it s kind 
__label__0 this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue what sense does that make this film isn t alone most films seem to do this now for 2 years i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv but then i got a new tv there it is again background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue it was even more distracting in this film because in the english version anyway the woman mumbles constantly i kept hoping jean reno would say excuse me would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth if you watch it on dvd you have even high school french i recommend the french version with subtitles i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon people rave about the scenery but i saw it on a tv i lived in the rockies for a few years so enh 
__label__1 i loved this mini series tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham a beautiful young woman hiding along with her young son from a mysterious past as an anglophile who loves romances this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the 1800 s i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production 
__label__1 heartland was in production about the same time as michael cimino s heaven s gate heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film heaven s gate was the biggest and most expensive 40 mil in 1980 hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the united artists studio to mgm imdb entry heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting it easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer life it s sad that hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys based on a director s single big hit and neglect such a wonderful story 
__label__1 this is one of quite a few cartoons with bugs bunny and marvin the martian and a space dog called k 9 is included as well this looney tunes episode is very funny has reasonably good cartoon animation marvin s animation is very well done and the plot is well done the end is rather weird so be prepared for it it is slightly boring in this episode marvin the martian has been sent to earth to capture an earth creature and bring it back to mars with his trusty dog k 9 marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but bugs bunny he greets them with treats thinking they are trick or treaters in their costumes little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mars i recommend this episode to anyone who likes bugs bunny marvin the martian and looney tunes in general as far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned you are likely to like this enjoy hasty hare :)
__label__0 we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l engle s fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you i m not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a made for t v movie would make up for its lack of razzle dazzle in its script after all the star wars spin off ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if i d gotten too close to the black thing while tessering the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard star trek first contact and radio as our favorite star turned mentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow that s right a crow moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight year old the majestic half man half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e t having gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tear inducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua in the film she is an unpleasant know it all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become a jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs whatsit and the man with red eyes nicknamed the dude with red eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character the story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which didn t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flat nosed wookies of ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth like camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad it s the way the characters are written that ruins it a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox in its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to self respecting people even madeleine l engle thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs whatsit was ugly score 0 1 10 if i could pros they got the names right cons it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main cover poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this symbolizes high adventure i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn t even bother to photoshop meg s arm on properly 
__label__0 this adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of rochester s character i get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read grumpy broody murky past he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy there is no chemistry the only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for charlotte bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave go and reread the book rochester has a personality and by the way a passionate love scene does not mean you have to eat her face 
__label__1 words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film it s one of the most wrenching you ll ever see yet the ending is one of the most loving tender and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for every actor in every role is terrific especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis a tightly wound and anguished ray liotta and a heart stopping turn from tom hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book he s the 1 pick for 1988 s best actor in danny peary s alternate oscars the last half hour borders on melodrama but the film earns every one of its tears and unless you re made of stone there will be plenty of them 
__label__0  they bothered making this movie anyone i didn t think so if you are looking for a coming of age movie go rent summer of 42 this is no summer of 42 when your big stars are nolte sarsgaard sarsgaard gets more screen time that is your first warning sign and of course for such an artsy movie there is plenty of cursing skin flung around just to make it look artsy sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting cardboard character punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense the intensity is that of someone with bi polar disorder miller is most famous for her looks what she had to say about the city of pittsburgh after this movie pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her she misrepresented an actual pittsburgh native foster gave sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style wow was this his first role after high school graduation so we have this weird triangle foster has a crush on miller but is with his boss girlfriend he can t take miller to bed won t take his boss to bed so he hangs with sarsgaard miller watches them get it on then after one of sarsgaard s pseudo intense moments foster miller get it on a scene that we are treated to in every sloppy moaning detail finally just to round it all out foster sarsgaard get it on with foster in the miller role now i know how 2 guys get it on as if that was ever anything i needed to know after all that all that s left is the tragic ending for one character the retrospective views of the remaining 2 it gets me right in the pit of my stomach oh wait that was the pepperoni pizza i just had i d like back the time this movie took out of my life please 
__label__1 i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away it is a real masterpiece of art and i don t understand why most of the people think it s garbage the main idea of the movie take your ego away and then you will have true power this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look do you remember this from the movie because our true enemy is in us it is our ego that voice that always tells us that we are important that gives us our pride that tells us not to give but only to take that creates our aggression that wants to be in control that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance a superb movie 
__label__0 return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn t play like a movie it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes return of the boogyman is just a clip show mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie over and over again the same footage how boring this is the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie i have seen the first movie i don t want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don t know who would the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it 
__label__1 i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both the movie more than the book made me come close to tears on several occasions this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible i give it ten stars 
__label__1 what a brilliant film i will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter at a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way cry freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid it is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko i may be wrong but although it is biko s story it is told in the perspective of woods so woods is an important character in conveying biko s story to the world cry freedom visually looks amazing with the show stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot george fenton s music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes it was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes the script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the police s attack of the south african citizens or biko s death the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch but is compensated by how it is shot performed and written and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well the performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn t a single bad performance regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in denzel washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as biko and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington s and the two men s chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note penelope wilton is lovely as donald s wife wendy and she is a great actress anyway out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me one was timothy west who relishes his role as captain dewet the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo role as kruger lord richard attenborough s direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual overall a truly wonderful film ambitious and long it is but never ceases to be compelling powerful and achingly moving a definite winner from lord richard attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise 10 10 bethany cox
__label__0 i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing last days and some charlie chaplin films based on the quality of the other features i decided to give immortel a chance i nearly walked out of this movie and i like science fiction the story is set in a futuristic new york city filled with blade runner style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning synthetic humans unfortunately the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour and forty five minute movie three groups exist in this world humans artificial humans and egyptian gods the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city the humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation the egyptian gods have a floating pyramid modeled on the great pyramid of khufu and complete with a deteriorated exterior leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid wouldn t a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it s there i won t bore you with the so called plot but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross out scenes the film as i said looks to have been influenced by blade runner and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix at the end of the film credits were listed thank yous to the united kingdom france and italy the film is french but uses british actors who don t speak french hence it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed this is a distraction and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting it doesn t help that the animations are poor no better than a video game skip this one 
__label__0 i love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say silent hill which i found to be quite good but still was missing something and movies that keeps you guessing this i thought was one of those movies at first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down i mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of stolen themes from that movie in here all in all i would say watch silent hill instead of this one its better its more scary it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better and best of all you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one this just seems to be one of those i like that movie so i m gonna re make it in my own really bad version kinda movie oh and one more thing lordi in a horror movie thats like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has hug me and i will love you forever written on the stomach of it 
__label__1 jafar panahi s comedy drama offside portrays some women trying to enter a tehran sports arena from which women are banned the official reason lots of foul language and the soccer players have their legs showing but of course it s really a case of sexism so most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to defy the men as i understand all of jafar panahi s movies this one included are banned in iran the real tragedy is that the cia s 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave ayatollah khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the koran to establish a chauvinistic society and that george w bush s current policy towards iran gives mahmoud ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship above all this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system not a great movie but worth seeing considering that all jafar panahi s movies are banned i wonder how he s able to even make them 
__label__0 everybody knows that gregory widen s original the prophecy didn t really require a sequel but you also don t need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable part two is a very prototypic example of a straight to video sequel meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action more witty one liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental if it wasn t for walken s performance and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig the prophecy ii surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales jennifer beals from getting born for you see her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel s evil dominion thus just as in the first movie he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown the prophecy ii is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don t make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity whenever the storyline becomes too tedious the makers luckily enough always insert a near brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences on a slightly off topic note i often felt like the prophecy ii ambitions to look similar to terminator ii gabriel s resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location where the final battle takes place looks very similar to the steel factory where terminator ii ended as well coincidence i guess overall this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you re a fan of christopher walken s unique acting charisma and who isn t 
__label__0 this movie was absolutely terrible i can t believe i paid to see it in the theatre i wouldn t watch it on free cable t v i m surprised that joe magtena even made it do not waste your time with this movie 
__label__1 what an overlooked 80 s soundtrack i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls bartenders and immature relationships were in style the best was his lousy texas accent compare that to friday night lights i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film also as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies tom cruise richard pryor robin williams and john travolta
__label__1 an overlong but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men and how they help each other out but the second half isn t as strong due to the elimination of the biko character still its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington in the film that put the latter on the map washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time overall a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit 7 10 ____________________________________
__label__0 i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art don t be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i don t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed the description on the back of the box doesn t even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then i ve lost all faith in humanity and don t even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations or that the cops didn t even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans :(

__label__1 home room deals with a columbine like high school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denial spoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philipps the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues erika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the part it s a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sant s elephant 2003 though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america ten out of ten
__label__0 this film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well it s just been invented by i robot what happened to practicality i e the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop what happened to showing respect for women i e smith s character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension i ll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground what happened to a detective that detects smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the i m snoring and not listening to you joke twice in one scene what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes shia labeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that a he degrades women and b he knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm what happened to hero s let s just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot don t get me wrong i m all for spectacle but i m also all for a shred of realism and meaning i have to say i ve never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques big budget action films you so have to die 
__label__0 bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire i m not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i don t know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of firefly serenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliens the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical blood spurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors don t play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people don t watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx aren t too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at best basically an okay watch is you re up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene 
__label__1 i almost didn t rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable acting it s not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasn t ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i m gonna check them out 
__label__0 kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman 50 who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie s character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays kirstie s brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it 
__label__0 rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly un hollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldn t find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know she s on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn t seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but can t cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with me what can i say this may click with you it may not for me it s time i can t get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned there s several real reasons why this is nc17 and rosario please you re a better actress pick better scripts 
__label__0 i m sure that the folks on the texas louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount s b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war no big cattle empires there they re much farther west in texas farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle they keep the cattle and that s the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start along the way foster marries dix s sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo anyway us easterners who like westerns usually don t bother with geographical trifles and it s still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount the climax is a blazing and i mean that literally gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production but i wouldn t have any but western fans look at it 
__label__0 actually it was pretty funny in a god how the hell did this movie get made kind of way if you life making fun of movies which i kinda do go ahead and watch it but if you re actually thinking is this a good movie eff off this movie sucked from the very beginning scene with the worst acting i ve ever seen in any movie usually they get five minutes into it before you realize this movie might suck but no you know right off the bat this movie talks about edgar allen poe never tried to explain it though to people who haven t memorized poe s life story so i don t know if any of what was said is fact this movie is about a writer ethan poe hookin up with his cousin ann they re both descendants of edgar allan poe or are they apparently people give a what their ancestors did this guy ethan poe is actually ethan usher who is supposed to be descendants from the story the house of usher that was written by edgar allen poe ann s brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her ann s also being stalked at one point in the movie by three different people on the same street seriously three they re like right behind her glaring at her and she doesn t even realize the characters that are being murdered throughout show up at the end to try to save the day but they can t at the end ann shoots ethan while he s trying to kill her best friend of course before she shoots him she has to scream out nevermore this movie should be seen nevermore 
__label__1 i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before dick tracy came out i still have the t shirt ticket i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and like that shirt dick tracy has stuck with me ever since if you ve seen the movie the sharp visuals bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain it s a wonder to behold as director star co writer producer beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here taking a familiar american icon and re creating him for a whole new era still set in the 30s tracy has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do i ve lost track of how many times i ve watched tracy and i still catch something new every time i do the others are all top notch starting with pacino s big boy caprice a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them even madonna s breathless mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment she can act gasp but there s still such themes touched on as the necessity of family keeping true to one s self good versus evil even machiavellian themes are explored odd for a comic strip film but hey it works all in all dick tracy is a classic unto itself compared with other films of this decade it makes a strong statement it s a good strong film that doesn t depend on blood violence profanity or nudity to make its point there s a lesson to be learned here ten stars great scott 
__label__0 i have grown up reading modesty blaise both the comics and the books and she truly is a heroine to me although not being a great fan of quentin tarantino i anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give modesty a nice big screen treatment she s worthy of i heard of my name is modesty a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here and wasn t too surprised to find out the score was not too high since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans heart if not done exactly right so i decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead and well i just finished watching it and i m stunned and sad and yeah pretty furious too sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as modesty blaise character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan it seems that almost everything about this film is sub par and unprofessional although i must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so i can t blame them but the screenplay and the directing my god why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average tv film but done much worse i don t know the background of this film and actually i really don t want to know but i just can t help wondering that how on earth could tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves modesty and then put his name on this he just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes the director was not the right man for this job and i can honestly thank him for ruining my night i give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could ve been worse the other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at oh well hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of the modesty blaise movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the modesty fans although if people like tarantino are the ones making the decisions i m not holding my breath

__label__1 i ve watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i ve seen from the house of bruckheimer the casting especially of the younger officers was spot on and the script and editing the soundtrack and the acting made this episode a tour d force if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best i hope there s is advance warning of when this episode is repeated because i m sure i ll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around 
__label__1 i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007 s films if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as 3 10 to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows you re dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller it s one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly masterson s screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay but the film has much more going for it than just it s delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top notch combining the sizzling drama thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell the screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the film s dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it s watching actors and then there s albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they re middle aged men and yet despite this it is clear how finney s father favours hawke s younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters wives of the brothers also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go by this film isn t revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and it s very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson s brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing first time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years 
__label__0 my roommate got the no no nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non stop after it finally totally brainwashed me into submission i found the songs to be irresistible especially the famous i want to be happy but i can t be happy but of coarse from the soundtrack i had no idea what the film was about so the other day i saw a copy of it at the video store and i rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film i was thinking that it was going to be amazing because the soundtrack is so cute unfortunately most of the songs that i loved were nowhere to be found in the video i saw now i ve never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldn t really understand what people were saying a lot of the time really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940 s fashion nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and kansas kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf the one dance sequence is a little weird too with nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin up girl imagery superimposed on top of her actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin up girls for money i like how guillespe keeps it old school and disses nanette when his masterpiece the piece that was to make his career is sold by nanette for a paltry 5250 doesn t she realize that that piece was his immortality silly rabbit girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat when will you learn why doesn t he just pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the work away 
__label__0 bamboo house of dolls 1973 1974 or 1977 various years are given for this title is a hong kong veteran chin hung kuei s killer snakes boxer s omen payment in blood etc women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers yes even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this and bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are brutalized abused and raped by the bad japanese what else during the world war ii the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan shaw veteran lo lieh is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn t even try to be more than it is there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that s about it in the merits department the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes for example one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements i won t accept to be found from any film the film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure for example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don t seem to have any problems lifting and moving it not to speak of throwing it also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema i have seen the same director s killer snakes 1973 which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society also it is a must for those who fear snakes bamboo house of dolls has suffered some censorship too which isn t a surprise considered the subject matter the uncut version dubbed into a non english language released in europe at least in france italy and switzerland runs 104 pal minutes while the cut english dubbed print released in holland belgium and greece runs only 84 minutes in pal from what i ve heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like bamboo house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i wouldn t have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation 2 10
__label__0 this movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen my sister and her boyfriend went to rent zodiac 2007 and got this one by accident thought it was a joke before the actual movie this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did this movie had not actual facts about the real zodiac killer the filmmakers clearly didn t even bother to research anything on the killings they only liked the name so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name i am upset i didn t realize it wasn t the movie sooner i try to like something out of every movie i don t hate movies ever except this one if you could have given it no stars i definitely would have 1 out of 10 
__label__0 i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival most of the audience including my wife enjoyed this comedy drama but i didn t it stars lucas haas brick alpha dog molly parker kissed the five senses hollywoodland and adam scott first snow art school confidential the director is matt bissonnette who s married to molly parker all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama and i thought it needed to be the other way around 
__label__1 the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950 s the main story follows a 14 year old girl reese witherspoon who develops a crush on a 17 year old neighbor jason london who ends up falling for her older sister emily warfield and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family s dynamics forever the 1950 s are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately witherspoon already begins to show the oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls parents and gail strickland who plays london s mom i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties

__label__0 you get a gift it is exquisitely wrapped the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper handmade and hand painted by the most talented of artists the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace it is a sight to behold then you cut the ribbon rip off the paper open up the box and find nothing that s toys you either enjoy the packaging or forget about it the film isn t without its point and purpose war is a not a good thing well isn t that original the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war war toys in particular are clearly a bad thing until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys it s like someone preaching a stern condescending sermon only to end by saying just kidding but even as an empty box the film fails close scrutiny yes it is a sight to behold with some remarkable striking images the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill but the images are cold and emotionally sterile like the screenplay the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold the film strives to be funny in a morose sort of way but the humor is forced and artificial robin williams as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire tosses in his ad lib shtick which only seems alien to the bizarre coldly structured world he is inhabiting indeed the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be for this film to work or make sense it needs to be set in its own universe an oz far removed from kansas every time the jokes jerk us back into reality the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham it is said that this was director barry levinson s pet project one that he had been striving to get made for ten years it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing like most pet projects that finally get made radioland murders radio flyer battlefield earth being great examples it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker s field of vision perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage he had already perfected it to death many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy mechanical wind up monstrosities so is the film itself 
__label__1 this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers stanley who meet all criteria as his supervisor says are always on time are hard workers do good work but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake this system destroys families stanley has to send his father to a nursing home where he quickly dies after stanley loses his job iris daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant references are made to the fact that now with declining wages both partners need to work the implication being that there s nobody left at home to care for the kids iris husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care iris brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and or teeth job even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail presumably he s also black and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates she remarks that he like her is doing time her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave stanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father s traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris brother in law does suggesting that he married the wrong sister he does not as iris says conform to the work eat sleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way in a sort of bauhaus ideal this was the dream of early modernists and 1920 s socialists such as the bauhaus to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations he is also outside of traditional gender relations he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron iris on the other hand lives in a traditionally male role she s a factory worker the mains source of income for her extended family and she brings stanley into the public realm traditionally off limits to women by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered male literacy here is used as a metaphor for the traditionally masculine public realm and the systems of circulation monetary vehicular cultural that enable participation in the public realm without this access stanley is feminized the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning he is excluded from all regular circulations unable to participate in the monetary can t open a bank account in the vehicular can t get a driver s license can t ride the bus and in the social he asks if he exists if he can t write his name after learning to read he grabs books on auto repair farming and spirituality the bible the word of god is therefore relativized placed on the same value plane as how to books in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex it is however acknowledged as a moral force iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching once able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner presumably he s an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn t forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line now that according to the pundits we ve comfortably moved on to post industrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period nevertheless it s highly recommended at least if you want to exercise your brain disregard the ending and it s close to a perfect 10 
__label__0 don t let the premise fool you this was one funny movie the problem it wasn t supposed to be a comedy the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes even worse the set up is never explained you will leave the theater asking is that it i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely flat nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with there are odd quirks and interesting turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie let this one come out on video before wasting your money 
__label__0 there s little to get excited about dan in real life first off the whole setup is incredibly contrived did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant marie wouldn t have told dan where she was going and since dan did all the talking during that conversation why would she be so attracted to him for that matter i never figured out why marie was so attracted to dan throughout the movie he s very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he s truly a good guy for example he lies to marie in the bookstore ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make marie jealous with a blind date there s more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where dan and marie are caught making out by the whole family yeah like that could really happen dan in real life is slow paced sappy and manipulative even chick flicks like the jane austen book club get higher marks than this predictable tearjerker 
__label__0 saturday night live national lampoon and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film however it is very interesting to watch now at the start of 2005 twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn t even clever at the time for something called the pregnant man which came true with arnold schwarzenegger s dumb movie junior there is a commercial spoof that probably wasn t even clever at the time for something featuring sammy davis jr and jackie onasis called celebrity wrestling which has now come true with a popular show called celebrity boxing there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn t even clever at the time that features john candy in a movie about a severed head watch this trailer and look how similar it s shots and plot are to frank hellenlotter s basket case and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about a dead dream the only two left the name of the documentary is the last hippies lol four prophecies come true

__label__1 i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastic i know it won t but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching i m looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it s very very good very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it s almost too realistic their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable i really hope it gets the attention it deserves it s done in the same format as the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if you ve got the chance you really should see it 
__label__1 this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort this film is produced by tsui hark and stars jet li this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions including the once upon a time in china series the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work i only saw the wires in two shots aside from the action the story itself was strong and not just used as filler to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema outlet in your area they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint 
__label__1 well i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason i was not disappointed the story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them for good the catch being that during training all of the clan were masked and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names the fights are a joy to watch as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style toad my favorite snake scorpion lizard and centipede the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence but stick with it and you won t be disappointed 
__label__1 i just saw this movie the other day when i rented it and i thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point but diane joined boxing because she wanted to i thought this movie was good i gave it a 8 10 that s how good it is plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good even is she s been in only six 
__label__1 i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms blom s directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel i e they are layered with back story and potential futures there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst self inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth shattering dilemmas if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves briskly along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind 
__label__0 big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and i ve seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it s just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut tee shirts that show off their stomachs sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodies and the gym still doesn t close for bereavement all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80 s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then 
__label__1 being the first feature film with robert de niro although not released for years later this is worth the watch de niro s role isn t huge yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today 
__label__0 the only reason i dvrd this movie was because 1 i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 i ve always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were shaq s outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my 12 year old son and i just squirmed and couldn t look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all it s terribleness we just couldn t stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam 
__label__1 this series premiered on the cable tv station comedy central in the united states it was chopped to death and shown out of sequence this was sad for the audience it should have attracted it didn t and fell by the wayside luckily at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc thank goodness because i got to see the league of gentlemen in order complete and uncut the league of gentlemen troupe is right up there with england s monty python s flying circus and canada s the kids in the hall but a warning the league of gentlemen though are one step beyond it s not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills it goes deeper and much much darker i can tell many of you now it will offend certain groups of people it will enrage others but remember its only comedy dark dark comedy if that is not your thing don t watch if you think you know dark comedy watch this if you get angry and upset then you don t quite know dark comedy these guys got it right and right on the button they are brilliant they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation there s a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end you cannot watch this one episode at a time willy nilly that is one of the charms of this series watch it in order see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are no one and nothing is out of bounds that my dears is dark humor bravo 
__label__1 here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made but whose standing seems to be raising in time the tenant is quite an interesting work by polanski one of the first of his european exile it is set in paris and as in so many other exile films the city its streets the seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role it is just that polanski chooses his principal character not to be an american as in frantic for example but a pole as himself was when going west there is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director s life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterfully may also be seen as some kind of exorcism it s in a way a circular story the hero named trelkovsky rents an apartment in old parisian building inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat and trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend stella a spectacled isabelle adjani in her first role after truffaut s l histoire d adele h soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are it s a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl he fights tries to run enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her the circle is closed it s not the most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion to a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters but how it happens reminding the classical knife in the water made more than a decade before at the end of the polish period of polanski there are many details that are never explained but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes the feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the english spoken dialogs the film was made in english almost neutralize the overall atmosphere however waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience it s not the best film that polanski made yet has many good parts it shows the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of his career

__label__0 i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like man on fire to find out that the movie it s the furthest thing from it the story was treading water from the get go and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea and the whole arm scene was too gratuitous the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly and this movie reveals that she ll never become a movie star the movie brought some of the worst acting ever i like tony scott s direction n all but this takes the whole friggin cake sorry ton 1 out of 10 
__label__0 italian born eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover karl an ultra modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods it s winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house but also that of eleonora as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair what was i expecting a thriller indeed but it wasn t quite so that s just the advertising on the package for ya i m quite perplex about everything the title the story and the motivation so how to classify it well this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound story of alienation possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals co writer along with william dafoe and director giada colagrande s art house film is just too clinical distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean although when its sudden conclusion materialises you ll thinking why should i actually care what we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments but more so make for an leaden experience as it never delves deep enough like it believes it does the sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic they are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow the base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh but it s never fulfilling and i thought there ll be more to it then all of this dreary lingering colagrande s direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines but everything feels like it s in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views most of the action stays at the one location the house camera work is potently taut but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes giada colagrande plays it sensually and william dafoe sleep walks the part he looks dog tired while seymour cassel pokes his head in now and then just where is it heading is anyone s guess well that s if you can wait around for it i think i ll give it the benefit of the doubt as it s definitely not what i was expecting from this indie film 
__label__1 a very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of boston and fenway park as a baseball fan and light movie addict it hit a homerun for me plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past bosox failures and how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage over the hill self serving kevin costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience jimmy and drew did a fine job as a young love struck couple suffering from jimmy s bosox jones it was a bit whacky and out of left field but there really are sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team the movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending although predictable had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies without being overly pretentious also enjoyable was the return of willie garson to the screen i miss the forever popular stanford blatch from sex the city he s always funny even when he does or says very little so buy yourself two box seats some popcorn and get ready for a fun time fever pitch is a winner 
__label__1 lock up your daughters is one of the best high spirited comedies i have ever seen it is misunderstood since it lacks the social commentary values that many films of the day 1969 required to be successful the characters are over the top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington a noble with hair too big to fit in the door the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff mistaken identities thwarted romances corrupt government officials and jokes at every turn it answers the questions what happens when 4 rambunctious eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town and who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out despite doing poorly at the box office it has great costumes excellent music based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name great lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame since so many bad movies are released every day 
__label__0 i ve read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing it s so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in cliche ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it doesn t because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull it s as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn t allowed by studio execs to give the story some true to life gusto or didn t have the cojones this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard issue bad lifetime tv movie 
__label__0 i saw this film last night about 102 minutes and don t know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i don t see how gere a buddhist got involved in this violent sexist trash 
__label__1 ultra grim crime drama from pou soi cheang the director of home sweet home tonally it reminded me of billy tang s run and kill although it s not as polished as that nevertheless it s an engaging flawed bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner pang edison chen who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer while fleeing the scene he kills the partner of cop sam wai who to add insult to injury is in the midst of dealing with his dying father so sam begins an insane obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence there must be something in the air lately because i ve never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately this is grim nasty stuff which is why i m so partial to it and i applaud its downbeat vibe it s visually arresting and the sound design is very unique dramatically everything spirals downwards until every character finds him or herself in a world of screaming pain a subplot involving pang s attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery 
__label__0 star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning mcbain played by gary busey before the name became synonymous with the character in the simpsons is a typically unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through only to be taken hostage along with the crew by a gang of terrorists this cheap looking even by 80s standards boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here edgy and zany as ever with butthorn being his trademark put down for the bad guys but without the material to back him up henry silva has presence as a screen villain but he s totally miscast here as an arab leader in a red beret and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden he s just one of a host of action film character actors including l q jones and lincoln kilpatrick who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix after a dull first half without much exciting action things do pick up a bit at the end but it s too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun 
__label__1 this was my favourite film as a child and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and i doubt anybody could ever re make the story of oliver twist on screen any better than this one did my all time favourite bad guy has to be oliver reed as bill sikes not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a 6 year old but now as a woman i can empathize more with nancys character the bar maid prostitute who helps oliver get the life he deserves jack wilde as the artful dodger was fantastic and i don t think anybody could ever out do him as the street pocket picker and best friend of fagin the music is fantastic especially fagin s numbers i m also quite thankful they didn t give bill sikes a musical number it wouldn t of worked with him being such a sinister character i think carol reed did an excellent job of nancy s sticky ending keeping it a g rated movie by disguising her beating but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her this movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical sing along as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life 
__label__0  here be spoilers recap mia helin is returning home from capital stockholm to rural rättvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday she is by far the youngest child and has two sisters eivor ernst and gunilla petrén eivor has a family and still lives in rättvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away mia is still single and is focused on her career there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle as the party goes on and alcohol consumed more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise comments to be the work of a new writer director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy dramas has been following for years there are really no new elements or ideas this movie draws upon three basic areas 1 embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves 2 sorrow and 3 anxiety this move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along no loss though since the humor that is there is not funny the performances from the cast are good i guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none to conclude there are better ways to spend one s time than watching this 3 10
__label__1 definitely one of the lesser of the astaire rogers musicals it s just very poorly plotted and paced it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time for example but it feels a heck of a lot longer this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard scott is rarely ever interesting i like hilliard she s sweet and i love at least one of her songs but where are you get thee behind me satan her other number is a weak leftover from top hat thankfully cut from that masterpiece follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers the dance is just fantastic i m putting all my eggs in one basket presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don t quite have perfected yet its imperfections make it all the more perfect and let s face the music and dance is easily one of irving berlin s best songs so the film is well worth watching for its great moments 
__label__0 as interesting as a sheet of cardboard this dispensable period piece has little going for it it s overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real life characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolution s fickle hand of justice eric rohmer at 82 it shows 
__label__0 once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing i just recently reviewed baby face nelson now i ve seen dillinger and i ve had it this movie is garbage i don t know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde this movie is far from a classic someone called it brilliant that s an insane thing to say this movie can t get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i ve ever seen i don t know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger first of all he looks nothing like him second of all by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31 when oates made this he was 45 you could even tell that he s older than the real dillinger just by looking at him not only was he too old but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis they show baby face nelson die then homer van meter and finally john dillinger john dillinger was killed before both of them the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson not only do the writers not know when they died but they also don t know how they died baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns homer van meter was cornered by the police in st paul and gunned down with machine guns another member of dillinger s gang harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie pierpont wasn t shot harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i m not going to go into it again here let me also add that richard dreyfuss portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic there s a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming leave me alone baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought maybe dillinger didn t agree with nelson s bank robbing methods but they never fought nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten they keep calling him lester baby face nelson he was never in his life known by that name nelson s real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood john milius doesn t know anything where the hell did john milius get his information i could probably make a better movie than him finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette by the way billie frechette wasn t even there that night but a girl named polly hamilton was melvin purvis yells johnny dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away they didn t even have to shoot him they were so close that powder burns were found on his face it was murder they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger s death i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn t john dillinger but i ll stop here if you would like to know more check it out heresee the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want but don t waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie 
__label__0 i have to admit i ve caught this one a few times on the usa network there s just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it s on yes you re right about the sub par acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i can t help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel 
__label__1 this game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand one false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest it was a light hearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the tv screen after the scandals of the 1950 s game shows but it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again 
__label__0 i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it a group of tourists supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn only problem is unless i miscounted there s only one mutant on display and he isn t all that impressive sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago some gory but silly deaths help but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief the ending is predictable and has been done to death no pun intended 
__label__0 minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera maximum stretched scenes maximum headache inducing jerky zooms maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing up until the time flashes on the screen of 12 01pm you can fast forward and miss nothing since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing to be fair the movie does have some string music that was interesting so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this unfortunately that was not to be and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief forget about trigger man i know i am trying to merk
__label__1 when i was young i had seen very few movies my parents in all their wisdom rented this one i was very wary of what the movie was about in fact i wasn t even allowed to watch it my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry so what did i do late at night i trashed the vcr kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals i was arrested of course i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived i was only given a stern talking to and sent home my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr this tore me apart slave labour really sucks believe me but i had to do it chores all around the house what happened in the end we got a big screen tv dvd player and a surround sound system for my work how did i get the money easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney do you remember finding neno well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn t afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done in the end i never saw the film the head that didn t die and the rating i gave it is my life rating it s doing pretty good 
__label__0 i ll admit i ve only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next it seems after the first season the producers decided to completely retool the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamic as you have probably surmised already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager holly amanda bynes who moves in with her high strung sister valerie jennie garth in new york city decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high jinx while i miss the sitcoms of yore this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and it s sad because they have some decent talent on top of everything they insisted on changing the show val was living with a cast regular bf one season then he was suddenly gone so she opens a bakery what when things change that drastically you get the feeling that even the show knows it s bad i mean completely new sets characters written off and new show regulars on a side note this is just nitpicking i know this is a television show and not real at all but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex there are stairs with a terrace in manhattan are you serious 
__label__0 alicia silverstone pre clueless plays a modern day crime obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl pat verducci wrote and directed this b flick which isn t especially well made but is however surprisingly serious minded in regards to its leading character silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here despite the picture s kitschy undermining the supporting cast including kevin dillon and michael bowen isn t bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard not a cheesy camp fest but nothing exceptionally memorable either 1 2 from 
__label__0 if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director louis malle i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary midwestern american town in 1979 this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies considering i didn t know any of these people it was even less interesting because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey perhaps it was that values aren t as conservative as you might think this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes such as the republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine or perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town as several ugly ideas such as blaming jews for financial conspiracies anti black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored the small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed but when the film makers returned six years later the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan this seemed very disingenuous for several reasons first the 1979 portion was almost 90 of the film and the final 10 only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne what about the rest of the folks of this town did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative with only a few updates it seemed suspicious second while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years so did the gross national product and while malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period it was far from that as the period from 1974 1980 featured many shortages gas sugar etc strikes high inflation and general malaise while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration the country in general was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years while many in the media demonized reagan a popular sport in the 80s the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one sided and agenda driven had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadn t seemed too negative to be believed after all everyone didn t have their lives get worse this defies common sense then i might have thought otherwise overall not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985 by the way is it just me or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired at least in part by this film both are set in similar communities but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones 
__label__0  sky captain may be considered an homage to comic books pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences i don t think this is at all true one s expectations of the films fiction and serials that captain pays tribute to were entirely different especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama toward the climax of captain law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency one doesn t expect films like this to necessarily make sense one does expect them to be fun thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic captain has almost none remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side they can fly the chasm itself means nothing to them the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape if the land across the chasm is forbidden to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if i know that paltrow and law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat only giovanni ribisi who showed himself capable of great nuance here and angelina jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he d only been given the chance he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted the film had a great look but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical when it is used to create creatures who don t exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints there is no real sense of wonder a cgi mountain doesn t have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn t necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn t it feel that way it just didn t as for the weak and clichéd script homage is no excuse even so had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable the last samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that captain didn t most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that sky captain most definitely did not i d like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30 s and 40 s the original jay garrick flash or green lantern alan scott come to mind as being ripe for such treatment maybe the better more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film it would be hard to be worse 
__label__1 sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood s artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film one might argue if that is so at the end of the day it s a film about guilt justice and retribution for me at the end of the day it s more empathy than sympathy however in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film forget the go ahead punk make my day scene that s iconic but not original but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air zooming in on the city the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke s character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology also i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed although eastwood has enormous talent as a director dramaturgy has always been his weak point see play misty for me breezy etc thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog 
__label__0 i saw this back in 94 when it was finally released apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy i think the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier i have problem remembering details partly because i haven t seen it in a long time but i do remember it as a very dull movie i kept debating whether to walk out of it the store was not at all interesting or engaging was a 3rd rate america graffiti imitation none of the performances make it worth watching either one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating 
__label__1 before there was crash there was this interesting film called grand canyon released about 14 years sooner than the former film grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime to me crash was still a slightly better film but grand canyon was no slouch either taking place in los angeles an upper class lawyer named mack kevin kline takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time he calls for a tow truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps simon danny glover to take the truck away both men are threatened but simon manages to get himself mack and the car out of dire straits it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier you see simon s sister deborah tina lifford is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretary s friend jane alfre woodard this is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above mary louise parker as well as mack s wife mary mcdonnel who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto jeremy sisto in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story the director lawrence kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill has created a splendid movie here the cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that would ve made the film even stronger are glossed over the story involving the secretary is one and the second involving simon s nephew is the other these scenes should ve been more apart of the entire story and then maybe lawrence kasdan s views of life between the upper and lower classes would ve been more on a superior level instead of just very good still grand canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after there is also a small role for steve martin as davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movie s ideas

__label__0 marie dressler carries this depression era drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dressler polly moran team you ll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film it s also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from mgm leonard smith s bare bones cinematography is strictly from the set up the camera and don t move it school frequently to the detriment of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen it s like a pan and scan print before such existed or having their heads cut off the film doesn t even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production overall it s an unsatisfying mess with dressler frequently over emoting and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart

__label__1 before this little black and whiter the touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the american screen there were lots of these topics that hollywood and the production code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960 s so it s not surprising that it would take a little independent company like ida lupino s filmmakers to raise the subject the result is well meaning but somewhat compromised which is not surprising since director lupino had to work with code demands to get the movie released interestingly ann walton s mala powers main problem following the assault is not how others might see her but how she sees herself and it s a heavy load she s carrying will she ever be able to relate to men again will they look at her as spoiled goods after all this is 1950 small wonder she runs away rather than face these anxieties at home and at work even though family and friends are generally supportive overall this first part is earnest and well done the chase is hyped to inject some action into the plot but then this is a movie notice how the incurious neighbor fails to respond to the honking horn near chase s end had those been screams of alarm from powers instead the neighbor s lack of response would have raised an interesting albeit complicating issue the second half is pretty much given over to the production code in the sentimentalized person of rev ferguson tod andrews it s he to quote a phrase who gives her courage to face life again there s some effort at humanizing him is it ann or her dilemma that he s most interested in still his gentle and understanding presence comes across as a little too miraculous and a little too hollywood fortunately the ending avoids the usual hollywood cop out by emphasizing only the hope of a happy resolution for ann rather than its certainty give lupino a ton of credit for dealing with the topic in the first place given the overall results i expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to i also expect today s audiences find the treatment mildly interesting mainly because of powers excellent performance that brings out the purely human drama however the film works best now as a document of its time and what the cultural watchdogs of that day thought was appropriate for adult viewing

__label__0 a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap at least the music in spinal tap was good this is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at it s worst a bunch of hollywood execs bad musicians and producers create some poopie show so their kids can be in the spotlight oh please the potty humor was even bad i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids musicians actors and artists out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along help u all why wasn t gene simmons in it ameriac s taste in entertainment is going down the toilet 
__label__0 i don t know where to start the acting the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine i can t believe that the production staff reached a point where they said our job is done time for it s release i m just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are i don t know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the terrifying dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around 
__label__1 i don t know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever it s great that this show still airs and i love michelle it s cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny aw this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i don t know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone i love the episode when i think her name is dd the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family i recommend this show for everyone 
__label__0 as far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50 s there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non existent the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings i also couldn t help but think the budget didn t allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon honestly it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie it wasn t bad enough to be a good bad movie but wasn t good enough to be good either get the mst3k version it s more fun 
__label__0 the more i think about it there was nothing redeeming about thismovie i saw it 9 months ago so my memory might have made itworse than it was but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of10 after seeing the movie i met the director he seemed so cluelessas to what he was doing or what he had done and as far as icould tell he didn t care for the film either even he agreed that hedidn t really know what he was doing and he was forced to docertain things because it was filmed digitally i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that itbuilt for itself 9 people all have to be connected in some way howcan we get from point a to point b so in order get from theprostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10minutes on each character s relationship to another person itmakes one feel choked by the 2 demensional badly drawncharacters i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie stevebouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing that s it as isay 4 out of 10 
__label__0 this movie fails miserably on every level i have an idea let s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east maybe if we re lucky they ll all be shot and killed and we won t have to ever have our time wasted by them again did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life my god i can t think of anything i ve ever seen that was this bad i d rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film i ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless that s my two cents 
__label__1 i had no idea of the facts this film presents as i remember this situation i accepted the information presented then in the media a confused happening around a dubious personality mr chavez the film is a revelation of many realities i wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made i supposed the protagonist was mr chavez but everyone coming up on picturewas important and at the end the reality of that entelechy the people was overwhelming thank you kim bartley and donnacha o briain 
__label__1  der todesking jorg buttgereit s second full length feature film the first one was notorious nekromantik has no central character or characters but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide divided into days of the week it comprises of a series of set pieces each of which featuring the self destruction of a complete stranger yes the production values are low and it s disturbing but in many ways der todesking is extremely effective it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment unlike the other buttgereit s works it isn t very gory but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday episode a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide the last sunday episode is so depressing and full of pain just amazing if you want my opinion 10 out of 10 check out this post modernism shocker disturbing art in the purest form 
__label__0 this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacre unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesn t matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i don t care what happens to them it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me 
__label__1 bedknobs broomsticks is another one of disney s masterpieces it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations a similar concept was used in mary poppins when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art i am mainly rating this film through child s eyes because i have not seen it in years back then it was one of my favourite films it was magical and mystical and the last scenes the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle were my favourites there was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells ie people turning into rabbits which may be a little dated and silly now also i believe that the film starts off slowly through the eyes of a child this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely forgotten today 
__label__1 kiera nightly moved straight from the p p set to this action movie she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen s classic she is once again having a go just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life but then this is exactly what domino harvey the real one did and i being one of nightly s biggest fans believe she carries if off stuff 90210 for the non american world is the post code of beverly hills in la where all the film stars live domino harvey father s mostfamous film was manchurian candidate which appears in the film domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 after having been arrested for drug dealing she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey s sexuality in her interview with lucy liu if you find this film a bit far fetched then check out domino harvey as the facts are more amazing than the fiction 
__label__1 also known as stairway to heaven in the us during wwii british peter carter s david niven plane is shot down in combat but he survives he meets and falls in love with lovely june kim hunter but it seems a mistake was made in heaven he should have died a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight faced and it s beautifully directed the scenes on earth are in breath taking technicolor i ve never seen such beautiful blue skies and the scenes in heaven are in black and white niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great and very beautiful and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven the imagery throughout is amazing especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence and the special effects are truly great considering the age of the film there s also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep this is an absolutely beautiful thought provoking film highly recommended this remains unknown in the us which is a shame 
__label__1 i must admit out of the eros movie collection this has to be the one that i love the most as well as one other that i have also reviewed the story is something that really keeps you watching a lot of the eros films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it in pieces before production when you watch it all centering around sex and who can get with how many different people come the end of the film and oh dear god never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun it does not work that it is almost laughable but you do not want to waste the energy to do so losing control is exactly as its name comes on the protagonist the leading character the wonderfully talented and beautiful kira reed the control is the control a person has over their senses their body and feelings and one man changes everything for her makes her a different woman almost but the mirror is shattered at the same time this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first 10 10
__label__0 i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i m a big francophile and art film lover but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically the film is in essence disgusting i mean when i saw requiem for a dream i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film 
__label__1 masayuki suo who directed this fine film is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic in japan anyway college sumo comedy shiko funjatta suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success the story is engaging we both laugh often naoto takenaka is hilarious as he is in suo s two previous films and really root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society real life in japan suo has a knack for showing real life activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in make you laugh make you think and both entertain you and give you insight into today s japan also look for the the main 8 actors from shiko funjatta as they all appear again in various roles from supporting characters takenaka to short cameos many 
__label__0 if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror don t bother with gawi the film scarcely deserves mention alongside a list work such as ringu a tale of two sisters cure and ju on or even such good material as the eye or inner senses those films brim with subtleties unexpected imagery rich characters and a decidedly non western take on what s frightening gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty five years the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick but it s a bad fit one aesthetic is bound to smother the other guess which having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evil child subplot but the situation is hopeless clichés crap characters witless plotting a dull ghost ho hum 
__label__0 after a few lean years 1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis not only did he make that celebrated comeback tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well speedway and live a little love a little therefore personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away joe which at best emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering sure burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing as respectively a dopey indian father to elvis character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr presley too but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado as meredith s mexican wife the two jones henry and l q and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is meredith s stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day while there is a surprising if not unwelcome given their usual blandness lack of songs there seems to be no shortage of free for all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs as can be expected the typically western arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point on the other hand the climactic destruction of the house episode is one we ve seen too often since and doesn t work too well here 
__label__0 yuck i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written the acting is so apathetic at times and so over dramatic at other times why would a demonico kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal just for the heck of it and is it really necessary to show lilith s motorcycle whenever she s out somewhere we get it you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket it doesn t mean you have to show it all the time the faith s lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance everyone is a throwaway character forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill conceived movies i ve seen the scifi channel come out with stay away unless you re into bad movies 
__label__1 without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film performances by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spy rudiger weigang axel real name alexander hampel magnus czech intelligence controller ray mcanally magnus con man father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus mentor believer and british controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major membury are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u s intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others 
__label__1 i like this episode quite a bit ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was as has been stated the music is very good and it has a moodiness that doesn t exist in all episodes but one major plot hole exists so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it it is established that the light doesn t work in the vault don t you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked you d think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note granted this is tv whodunit fiction and various holes will always be found but this seems much too glaring it really doesn t make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn t work but the death bed testimony goes on unfound apparently for days 
__label__0 war inc corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser john cusack to do their wet work against rival ceos a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense there s no reason or method to the madness it s considered by cusack to be the spiritual successor to grosse point blank i e war is more or less a knock off we again see cusack as an assassin protecting spoiler the person he s supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not it s all quirky often bordering on bizarre war inc s not funny enough to be a parody and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film s message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesn t work because it s not funny and at its heart the film has no heart we re supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusack s shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war john cusack gives a decent performance his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isn t a lot of chemistry between them hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesn t make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out blech ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn t start doling out a decent performance now and again pathetic it s not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c 
__label__0 i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist as this film was touted but this one failed me miserably for me the plot was a bit confusing to follow and i rapidly lost interest i feel so sorry for john cusack joan cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei and hillary duff for getting involved with this movie i ll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one the one thing i can say positively about the film is that hillary played yonica s character so well that i didn t even recognize hillary it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her luckily i rented it for 1 through red box had i paid to see it in on the big screen i would be really fuming 
__label__0 this movie is awful at the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can t get back the twist ending is very contrived the character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion ninety minutes of preparation with the premise that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve is explained away in literally ninety seconds of no we were just tricking you then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it i will forgive you if you can forgive me is as upset as he gets if someone took weeks to convince me i was about to die and then said no sorry just fooling you i would raise some serious hell i don t feel bad about giving away the spoiler because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching please save yourself and don t watch this movie 
__label__0 this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons 1 perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android 2 it wasn t an android at all but a woman the beautiful jean marsh the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they d done it properly in fact the modernization of sex bots are in the news as i speak robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so they could have at least had her act like one her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element instead it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity normally no one cared but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine or downright carelessness 
__label__0 very outdated film with awful cliché ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction in addition cassavetes and falk overact constantly a pseudo good movie it takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is the first scene is a total bore filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges the sound is horrible camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters no poetry no subtle psychology no interesting shots the actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages very cheap indeed one exception ned beattie s nice and simple way of playing the hit man 
__label__0 or maybe that s what it feels like anyway the bat people is about as flat as a rug bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock and as intelligent as all three combined okay plot in a nutshell fitting vessel that a doctor moss gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife mcandrew and subsequently turns into a bat well not exactly a bat but a bat like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first person camera viewpoint but then there s the business of the sheriff pataki who is about the worst kind of sheriff the hick kind he hassles people he leers at married women he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries the fiend he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time making him look and sound like buford t justice in smokey and the bandit and this is the worst part he s the most likeable character in the whole film the whole film though is just tv movie of the week like crapola guano in this case it s an aip for crying out loud what did you expect oscar caliber stuff and what else can you say about a film that not even mst3k can save how about no stars for the bat people full version or mst3k version by the way if there s ever a sequel for this movie i m burying my tv 
__label__1 i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn t feel very good i ended up liking it big time it s a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship unwanted betrayal power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail the acting is on it s prime level two of the women that i lust the most star and that s a good thing claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience plus it shows the difficult times at thailand this is an underrated movie not many films like this one have come up in recent history it should make you reflex about many things 
__label__1 new york police detective mark dixon dana andrews is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life the strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law he has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals he is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father s reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence when a rich texan is murdered following an evening s gambling run by gangster tommy scalise gary merrill dixon is assigned to the case scalise tells dixon s superior officer detective lieutenant thomas karl malden that the victim had been accompanied by ken paine craig stevens and his wife morgan gene tierney and that paine had committed the murder dixon goes to paine s apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when paine punches him dixon retaliates and paine collapses and dies dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river paine s wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at scalise s place adds that her father had gone to paine s apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she d returned home with facial bruising paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father jiggs taylor tom tully had threatened that if it happened again he would beat paine up this information leads to taylor being arrested and charged with murder nobody accepts dixon s explanation that scalise had killed the texan and then had paine killed to eliminate him as a witness dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paine s death and the cover up he does this and also records that he is going alone to confront scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for dixon s murder the confrontation with scalise and the eventual means by which dixon achieves his own redemption provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller dana andrews strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character s perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow paine s accidental death dixon however isn t the only one to experience misfortune as morgan a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her her father who d some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit ken paine who d been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and scalise who d been set up in business by dixon s father also suffers his own misfortunes where the sidewalk ends is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity 
__label__0 i was kinda interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick i was thoroughly disappointed it was the same kind of disappointment i felt watching friday the 13th jason takes manhattan so much potential wasted the opening scene is a decent attention grabber then it grinds to a halt copious breasts and egregious 80s fashion cannot help this movie the only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha i m not asking for cannibal holocaust level of gore but i was looking for cheap over the top exploitative gore i got none of that i found a couple parts of the fight scenes somewhat intriguing hence the 2 stars i don t think its really worth the time it takes to watch it though i could see showing it at a party where nobody cares about what is going on and you just want something on in the background but i would not tell anyone oh dude you gotta see this movie it is neither good enough nor bad enough to warrant much attention 
__label__0 i don t what that other review was talking about this definitely isn t a bimbo movie in fact i don t think there was one decent looking girl in it no it s just cheesy poorly done ed wood style science fiction schlock and it s bad i can t even begin to tell you how bad it is i saw it late at night on cable and i was in shock the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow to me though the music tops it all a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone do not rent this thing but if you ever see it on cable watch it you ll be amazed at how bad a movie can be 
__label__0 this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story apparantly not such a difficult task first of all a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch this one lacks all these things too much light the spots oh my god why in the name of christ judas was that about every time dracula came about he was devoured by light in the script to keep him weak for the record just weak there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching near the ending of the movie beatiful dancingscene with dracula and his new conquest i really enjoyed the first one the judas twist was defintely original but this one s just not good not in any way hopefully the third one will cary the vampire signature i like so much in other classics like herzog s nosferatu coppola s dracula or even interview with the vampire 
__label__0 ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel it s too easy so i m going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of little man first i m impressed with the special effects it really did look like marlon wayans head was attached to the body of a little person i never doubted it for a minute secondly i loved some of the unexpected cameos david alan grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his renditions of havin my baby and movin on up were priceless john witherspoon who coincidentally played grier s father in 1992 s boomerang if you remember he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket now plays vanessa s father in little man so that was fun beyond that this movie is about as believable as white chicks how dumb is it when even the doctor can t tell that it s a 40 year old man and not a baby he s got a full set of teeth how is it possible that no one seems to notice that it s not a baby little man is so bad that there s a rob schneider cameo and please if you re stupid enough to waste 8 on this movie at least do me a favor and do not bring your children this movie is way too sexual for small children lots of jokes and innuendo about sex going down eating out etc and i felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening i was forced to endure if you insist on seeing an idiotic film as least spare your children the pain and suffering 
__label__1 the movie was very sweet and heartwarming i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so inspiring to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie the little girl who raised paulie love overcame all the obstacles

__label__0 in an otherwise good review loleralacartelort7890 says the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available it uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x rays and gamma rays space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares but it simply wasn t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief 1 2 hour or so passage through the van allen belts they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 1 5 rem and usually much less of the 24 men who flew to the moon 12 of whom landed 18 are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis roosa and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s shepard would be 86 
__label__1 taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience in my opinion their mission was accomplished a must see for young children pre teens teens and their parents ok there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order but parents with young children should sit tight the movie moves on to better things i am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that emma roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women not syrupy about it either nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills a lot to like in here laughs doesn t take itself too seriously a real mystery to solve one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus and likable characters nancy drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion 
__label__0 unbelievable this film gets a 7 out 0f 10 this has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years not only was the acting incredibly bad the storyline if you can call it that was just as bad offcourse everyone knows what s going to happen within the first 5 minutes which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment that however is not the case there is no action no suspense not even a spark between the 2 leading actors it was unfortunately a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money and the 2 of merely for trying
__label__0 wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believable the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town she s had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a big time actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about shenanigans as this actor is a cad so the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor and the actor dies as a result he s convicted of first degree murder not manslaughter but murder 1 now pregnant and in need of funds kay goes to new york but broadway jobs aren t to be found so she s forced to take any job even burlesque unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy but the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play despondent she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kid but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husband s lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10 000 he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people how can 10 000 get him out otherwise maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wow this is enough for 2 or 3 films and all this occurs by the 45 minute mark believe it or not there s quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds this is sort of like kitchen sink writing throwing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms francis best efforts it s the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd rate plot it s almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a die hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not good by the way the child who plays francis daughter upon her return to new york sybil jason really was terrible i think she was supposed to be i think 
__label__0 as i watch this film it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is save for an heroic moment for much of the film the other black men and dark skinned black women in the film are way in the background barely visible vanessa williams character was strong and sympathetic the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her there are also some fairly visible and three dimensional support characters who are light skinned and some white characters of some warmth and dignity but 99 of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men voiceless shadows in the background of no consequence such a horrible flaw but anything but unusual in the mainstream media 
__label__1 considering all the teen films like the breakfast club and pretty in pink that are lionized it is surprising that this one is so ignored there is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it the kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as monsters it deals with hero worship how one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real dustier before realizing that she was wrong the movie is kind of ahead of its time one kid asks another kid what birth control she uses she says she is doing nothing to need birth control she replies wrongly oral sex 
__label__1 okay as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious the main character is a business man who is stuck in a same thing different day mentality he sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her he decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor from there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman there is no gratuitous or any sex involved just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed this film was remade with richard gere and jennifer lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original the movie never made it big in america because it was not eligible for the oscars since it was broadcast on television in japan movies cannot be released on tv or they are disqualified for oscar nominations it did win numerous awards in japan for best film cast director etc for their oscar awards 
__label__0 i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film nearly every review of this movie had been positive the effects looked enticing the previews convincing needless to say disappointment actually doesn t describe the feeling i got from this film it was rage beyond being boring and poorly written the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source i understand the difference between an homage and stealing this was stealing more importantly it seems that the filmmakers didn t steal to progress a point or move the plot along they stole just to show that they could there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene that i won t elaborate on which steals from the same film needless to say every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen from pulp era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film the iron giant to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in star wars the phantom menace on the subject of the actual film most of the performances were completely wooden perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue screen with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors frankly this is no excuse for poor acting if a person was ever a child they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying finally there is no humanity in this film the protagonists are the only real human beings here nearly all the antagonists are robots and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand if robots are attacking the entire planet shouldn t we expect to see masses of humanity running from them the sub par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to really anything here the film wasn t the worst movie out there which is why i didn t give it a 1 rather the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects but without artistic vision or originality of any kind it falls flat 
__label__0 protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film 
__label__0 i was very disappointed with this film i expected more of a thelma and louise female buddy crime movie instead the women prison escapees in this flick had no sense of loyalty to one another they were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas who beat each other up double crossed each other and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film instead of being shrewed thieves who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money the women escapees were too selfish and vicious to trust each other for long these women weren t liberated in a positive sense they just ended up being a bunch of loose cannons incapable of respect for themselves or each other if you like 70s female crime caper films skip this bomb and see the great texas dynamite chase which stars claudia jennings and jocelyn jones 
__label__0 maybe i m missing something because i ve read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews and i just don t get it i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j cobb his rumpled rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing smooth talking noir archetype as you ll find or take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i ve seen in a while she s just not convincing in the role as for the plot it s tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it 
__label__1 this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome the character development in this film is excellent we get to believe that harry is a businessman who neglects his family and georges is an innocent man who craves loving and care from the normal society acting is excellent and the cannes best actor award is well deserved the fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that georges misery towards his abandonment by his family and his desire to be treated like a normal person the song that gets played repeatedly also reinforces this message the film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured we have been treating them with discrimination and neglect a fact that is highlighted by the scene where georges gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen if we get to understand and share these people s world both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy i was so drawn into the film and the characters emotional experiences it is a touching film for good natured souls 
__label__0 the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his character s name is che and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not that che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided the younger generation off to america so cliché other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy s family however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who we are introduced to them all in the beginning a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the special visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films and the black character as greek chorus strictly gratuitous intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened 
__label__0 how this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable an unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle deep characterisation motivation and a really awful soundtrack replacing tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars then there are the specific references to the original which are merely plastered on over the cracks dreadful in a world where gormless brain dead amerikan remakes of the italian job a tear appears get carter sobs uncontrollably and alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit execrable nonsense how ellen burstyn ever got involved is a wonder rubbish 
__label__1 in 1943 a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in 1950 it was decided to film his account and it kick started a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within 1959 the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn t give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non actors without exception all are constantly mono tonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex service i suspect they recreated their war time roles as officers and gentlemen this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn t end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end 
__label__1 it s hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn t enough words to give this magnificent stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves they should make this the official and only true real hamlet movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh s hamlet it s a perfect complete version of the play potent massive earthshaking first class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of they ve packed over a dozen of world famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses branagh is phenomenal in the leading role his sharp irresistible performance is the only one of it s kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end branagh s version of hamlet is among the ten best motion pictures ever 
__label__1 this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal all time favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation 
__label__0 this is not an all around terrible comedy but it is very dull it has barely any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values there is one poignant moment near the end when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his nemesis and tells him that you ve been my one worthy adversary and now we can start all over again that scene however along with burt kwouk s amusing cameo in the beginning are the only memorable parts of the movie 1 2 
__label__0 another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko s marvellous 1950 thriller where danger loves this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum faith domergue and claude rains crisply photographed in black white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow where danger lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood s past see my full review unfortunately none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension poorly written allen rivkin and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist blandly played by richard baseheart and his overtly floozy wife a risible audrey totter is totally implausible and unconvincing how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody s guess then when she unsurprisingly ditches him for one of her playmates lloyd gough our timid pharmacist instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan another bland performance so who did kill him well at this stage of the movie you really couldn t care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry mr berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film s opening so much for that a most unfortunate effort c est la vie best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes hey maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes huh in its favour however are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers commentaries and featurettes for both films but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic 
__label__1 i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word which i normally don t use lightly wonderful in my view the best movie ever made who deserves oscars and other awards if not this swedish crew who have created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film when everything that is said and left unsaid throughout the story is drawn together just as the character of daniel dareus evokes so many sentiments and long repressed feelings within the people around him the movie does the same to its viewers you walk out with your head abuzz and your heart feeling full great stuff next time you ask yourself what is the meaning of life perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven happy content fulfilled to say it with virginia woolf s mrs dalloway such moments are enough 
__label__0 what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm homeless people answer to no one they have no mortgages rent payments or idiot bosses homeless people don t have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card payments but give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race buying gas for transportation paying insurance on their car and working for someone else they get a chance to be a productive citizens this film was about as exploitive as a film can be it s a way for the rich and middle class sheeple to say see what happens when you try to help the poor and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance why not a film that asks what happens when you take away everything a rich man has 
__label__0 what the hell was all that about i saw the matrix and was amazed it was the most spectacular movie ever made what ever possesed the wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me there is no plot you can t argue with that basically all this film was was a load of talking and don t get me wrong i have no problem with talky films but all the talking in the matrix reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle then there would be a fight sequence which lasted way too long then more pointless drivvle then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti climax ever a little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes also keanu reeves gives his worst performance yet i knew he wasn t a good actor but this was beyond a joke if you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along god knows what his performance is like in something s gotta give keanu reeves the only plank of wood ever to become an actor after the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment if you haven t already seen the first film i suggest you watch it but don t waste your time with this utter pile of turd

__label__1 this was obviously the prototype for mick dundee but the adventures of barry mckenzie is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry crocker in the title role an australian who invades england to upset the poms with his free flowing uncouth ways few brits will be upset by barry s frequently cruel observations on his hosts the relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film s final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant mckenzie as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the poms 
__label__1 this film is famous for several qualities a literate script for once in partly religious film making by philip dunne some very good performances a first rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king if one were making a film then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production add the cast of this film including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters james robertson justice raymond massey kieron moore jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special but in a biblical subject script usually a sub genre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions everything would ultimately depend on the author s skills philip dunne here has supplied human beings a rare achievement in biblical films david is a man in this film many sided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament gregory peck makes him curious passionate self controlled self deprecating and appealing as bathsheba hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns the familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations david s youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel and earns his way to be second to the king saul by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior thereafter he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan the king s son formerly a friend his wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife michal jayne meadows is saul s daughter and is cold to him he turns to bathsheba whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her but she has a husband uriah when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle even after being aroused by verdon s dance david agrees he is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question drought comes to israel and the king s infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon at last david places his hands on the ark of the covenant recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it inviting his god to punish him and nothing happens david exits the temple and finds that rain has come to his parched land this film is always interesting varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful the director and author make use of the observer principle and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the grecianized near eastern canon wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures well remembered for its glowing realization fine performances and intelligent dialogue this dramatic effort bears repeated study 
__label__1 this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery no one could have done it better the suspense was palpable throughout i wish mr wilder would grace us with another of these i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr wilder in but i had no idea how truly talented he was until i saw murder in a small town and this follow on he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and of course in his brilliant acting his subtle wit comes through in spades i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and or gene wilder s film work his star just gets brighter and brighter 
__label__0 who was george c scott george c scott was a renowned actor practically any movie that he s been in is the better off for it now ol george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie but he once said something that describes said movie to a t i don t recall his exact words but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting but great acting cannot save bad writing never has this little observation been truer than in the all new adventures of laurel hardy for love or mummy the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect bronson pinchot laurel and gailard sartain hardy not only look the parts but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal mannerisms and all this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents that said this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to you guessed it writing aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain which was very in character and a brief gag involving a taxi this movie is an absolute chore to sit through problem 1 too much time and effort went into the plot i don t want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady what i want is to see stan and ollie or at least their stand ins way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not very funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around however even if this movie had been all jokes that would still leave us with problem 2 most of the jokes are what i would call watered down slapstick what do i mean by watered down in slapstick a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ala looney tunes 3 stooges or how about laurel hardy in watered down slapstick as i define it a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect maybe an illustration would help in looney tunes daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd his bill falls off and he puts it back on that is classic slapstick in this gem ollie accidentally bumps into some people they turn around tell him to be careful and continue on their merry way that s not slapstick that s not even funny that s just boring and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes it s as though they re this movie s bread and butter the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they re supposed to be funny granted the example i just gave is the most extreme case but i can only cut it so much slack long story short the film just doesn t work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot s and sartain s abilities to impersonate stan and ollie instead the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with not a good movie but an incredible sleeping aid i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal just so long as you steer clear of atoll k and be big 
__label__0 all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes it looks cool it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late 60s period and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable once you get that message you may as well switch to another film davies s protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend one of the few people in his life who cares about him then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world instead of living a fantasy film of which he s the imagined director he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he s idealized beyond reason a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzman s fall from mount rushmore in rushmore schwartzman s annoying brattiness was something to be overcome but here it s his character s only quality schwartzman s family connection clearly landed him in this role here s hoping his choices improve 
__label__1 i don t think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake especially for originality yes the scarecrow is a kung fu fighting frightner but why not no one else is willing to go that far i really haven t had this much fun watching a movie since candyman so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow even his mom doesn t care about him then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow who then goes on a killing spree his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs with one liners you ll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick i would say grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a off with this movie i love it for its originality most fun 
__label__0 this was a crappy movie with a whole lotta non sense and too many loose ends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron livingston made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it got more ridiculous sean crawley good looking chris l mckenna whom i ve never seen before but loved his little nude scene is making ends meet as a painter when he meets electrician duke wayne george wendt from cheers thinking he s getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews daniel baldwin playing a stereotypically evil guy ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ron livingston in a cameo who i ve been in love with from office space up to sex the city ray end up offering the apparently desperate for cash sean 13k to kill the accountant and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the accountant whose wife kari wuhrer he finds himself attracted to completes the hit and leaves taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money up to this point it s a descent flick generally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the film s writer charlie higson had snapped out of a 10 day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something without simply detailing the movie let s just say that in every single scene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself gasping what the f k baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many loose ends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched it this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it s full value it s supposed to be a psychological thriller and mckenna is a decent actor but it s hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots girls will enjoy handsome sean s gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron livingston is only in the first one third of the movie 
__label__0 i guess i am coming late to the party i just saw this 1995 version of bye bye birdy on sky tv i didn t know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when i turned it on i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do i was not impressed with this newer version it just wasn t enough fun it was not colorful it lacked the exuberance of youth the lighting was bad no one seemed to mention this fact this is not a moody musical it is bright and up beat the lighting decision was a poor creative choice bye bye birdy is a farce a comedy of errors i got no sense of that in this version the lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances the dance numbers seemed anemic as well we do have music videos these day at least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those or how about some of the best of broadway the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed although all the actors were supremely talented there were some really bad casting choices vanessa williams is not latin and with so many talented latin performers out there wouldn t it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of rosie vanessa is african american lovely and talented but bad casting jason alexander s effort was astounding he always does intelligent work but he just wasn t albert he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version the medium of film is not the medium of stage there needs to be translation from one medium to another the exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed the spirit the essence of the production must be brought forth to me the 1963 film production of bye bye birdy was bright and lively while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people 
__label__0 a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and cornwall sean pertwee is the real star of this film while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal for those who don t like surfing or cornwall in the slightest you ll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they re put in only ewan sean and catherine s characters make this a film worth being on videotape which is why it was only released on videotape in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame 
__label__1 an unqualified 10 the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old hollywood sam neill and meryl streep are very good together neill matches streep line for line and take for take it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best notwithstanding the intensity of his role this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms the movie which won several top awards in australia boasts not only a superlative cast and director but wonderful and authentic australian locales it proves that people are the same the world over and after all these years people still delight in repeating the famous streep line accent and all a dingo ate moy baby including that imp elaine benis on seinfeld 
__label__0 my first opinions on this movie were of course bad i was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects movie what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasn t that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie it s still a pretty bad film but it s not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and i m pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasn t that good overall it s a film that should be avoided but to me it wasn t as bad as i was expecting it to be 
__label__1 the tattooed stranger was another of those rare b movies that bbc2 screened over christmas new year 2005 2006 see also they live by night and the brighton strangler in this one a man walking his dog in central park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside she was shot and police then try to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue after being identified the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the end most of this movie was shot on location in and around new york so we get to see some areas of the city we don t normally see especially the back streets mostly unknowns are in the cast with john miles getting top billing the tattooed stranger is worth seeking out excellent but rather obscure rating 3 stars out of 5

__label__0 well you d better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and pokey flick about a middle aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like set in tunis mom piddles around the flat gets antsy and decides albeit reluctantly she just can t help herself to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x2 and read the subtitles fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring uneventful low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits go figure c

__label__0 seriously there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all randolph scott a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role at 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it doesn t matter so much here because gail russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn t enough to save this garbage thank god they don t make westerns any more they re just dated racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder 0 10 
__label__1 series three blackadder the third if you want something done properly kill baldrick before you start hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent a vain and stupid foil for blackadders venom played by hugh laurie baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw the format is similar to the previous show after all now they had found the winning formula why change things we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways trying to make bladrick an m p or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times samuel johnson william pit and wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
__label__1 i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first twenty minutes the artwork and main character who is enigmatic doesn t talk much really got me in this movie i really liked this movie it was dark beautifully acted and really touching it s a bit slow but the immersion was complete the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes the ending was unexpected with a twist i didn t see coming it s not the kind of movie we see often 
__label__0 shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended 
__label__1 once again i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for 4 88 fifty percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap i mean horrible beyond belief but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good this movie is much better than i expected i found it very engaging though it was obviously made by an amateur the direction is nothing special but the story is intriguing with some good thrills i expected it to be more of a comedy but i wasn t too disappointed for a thriller this movie is surprisingly good natured there s no bloody violence no profanity no nudity no sex usually these movies require all four of those elements the pg rating is well deserved not like sixteen candles where the f word is used twice and there s a brief gratuitous nude scene i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could ve been developed more the film does tend to be plot heavy and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them we end up watching a careless three minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors they end up kissing at the end but there s so little chemistry that it seems forced the dream machine is no gem but it s good clean entertainment it s quite forgettable especially with a cast of unknowns except for haim but it s also much better than you d expect my score 7 out of 10 
__label__1 a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers it s a couple of decades later gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses when students he s fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he s just all talk this is a subversive film in that there s not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles maybe it s certainly no protest by numbers though being too warm where u s film may seem realistic because they re urban and gritty this and other british films of recent years those that don t try to match america for visceral thrills are real because british humour reveals truths 
__label__0 most of the french films i ve seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but that s okay i found them interesting well photographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that way this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talk which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching this actually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like this but i want a little more bang for a murder story 
__label__0 a good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy peter ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable regardless of the favorable comments here this film is awful badly directed badly edited badly acted badly written you need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad the muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns ustinov conning his way into an american insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds how he does it is beyond lameness and credibility he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets and hoodwinks computer expert robert morley into going to south america and stealing his identity as a side plot ustinov romances fellow loner maggie smith who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building she ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with bob newhart that go nowhere while ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of newhart and karl malden then he marries smith and they fly off to brazil which has become the staple finale of almost every british caper comedy since nuns on the run a fish called wanda the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before by the end i was thinking i must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this even a cameo by cesar romero didn t help it one of the most unfunny poorly paced comedies i ve ever seen and certainly the worst caper don t waste your time if you love this you need to see better films 
__label__1 are highlights of this 1917 feature the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies on an island off the coast of scotland the villagers live the simple lives of fisher folk my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery and the camera work on boats is splendid maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film pickford was already a major star in 1917 and this film seems to have been written just for her plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done not a great picford film but still worth seeing matt moore pickford was married to his brother owen moore is the love interest and is good as the strapping island lad leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn t spot her either my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung very effective 
__label__1 although the notorious bettie page is well acted and shot is is at best a cliffs notes version of bettie s biography the film mainly centers on her work with irving and paula klaw the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos it does not detail her life after posing aside from her religious rebirth it cites the real bettie page by richard foster as a source but it ignores bettie s later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital the narrow focus of the biography can be debated but the majority of bettie s fans and the civilians would probably be more interested in her modeling career which is what they get the film is well acted with gretchen mol faithfully reproducing the look of bettie as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded the character is played as rather naive a probable byproduct of interviews given by bettie in recent years it is more likely that bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes the supporting cast is also outstanding with chris bauer and lili taylor playing irving and paula klaw and david strathairn as estes kefauver the film errs with the character of john willie played by jared harris john willie never met bettie page and was not involved in photo shoots with the klaws harris plays willie a bit like peter o toole in his more debauched state despite the quality of acting the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth the story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know bettie much like her photos it s just an image it does tend to exaggerate bettie s notoriety her photos were mainly seen in and around new york in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70 s and 80 s and the cult of betty page as her name was usually spelled grew bettie s greatest exposure pardon the pun was in playboy appearing in the january 1955 issue the christmas photo which is staged in reverse in the film the film is well done if rather shallow it is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances it hits the high points of bettie s life but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth the ending is rather a let down it feels rather abrupt still the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in bettie or even the time period the soundtrack is great really pulling the viewer into the 1950 s if nothing else the film stands as a showcase for america s burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its puritan past it s also a peek at an icon for both men and women 
__label__0 some wonder why there weren t anymore mrs murphy movies after this one will it s because this movie totally blew snot disney was not the right studio to run this film maybe touchstone well they re owned by disney but it d be more adult the film is too kid ish as the book series is not the casting is all wrong for the characters the characters don t even act the way they do in the books and why was tucker changed to a guy he s a girl in the frigging books was this done to make the film appeal to boys sheesh and where was pewter the gray cat one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth rita mae brown is a good writer but letting disney blow her work was wrong an animated feature film perhaps in the vane of don bluth s artwork would suit a better mrs murphy film overall i give this a 2 because at least disney made a film from an under appreciated book series but i wish they did better either way i still have my books to entertain me 
__label__0 this movie really i mean really sucks its got plot holes so big and 30 foot dragon can fit through them not to mention the dragon itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real i mean when you see something like this you gotta be thinking wow someone actually made this movie then released it that takes guts whoever they are i m sure they don t work in the film business anymore when i hired this movie it wasn t in on dvd so i reluctantly took it out on video the first thing to appear was a lord of the rings trailer for the two towers this was a very clever move putting this trailer on the video it justifies me reluctantly giving the film 1 star otherwise i would have given it zero stars maybe the producers though the star attraction of dean cain i think thats how you spell it would draw in the crowds uh to the video store that is next they employed split screen technique like in hulk to i assume compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is on the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon does the dragon look exactly like the one in dragonheart or is it just me either way the dragon in the film looks like a reject from gremlins 2 and has the cgi of a nintendo video game villain from the early 90 s perhaps worse also not the dragons movement as it pursues its victims its the same f cking monotonous movement right leg left leg right leg left leg dom dom dom dom dom dom f king dooooom this just pisses me off maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of jaws why not then have a dragon pov shot either way that was just funny much like watching a weebl toon dean cain gives many puzzled looks during the film maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career don t expect superman here the first time i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was an add for a ps2 game as for the story its so so bad my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he s unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn t there oh and did i mention that i f king hate the people who made this incredibly stupid stupid crap atrocious film 
__label__1 herbet clutter wife bonnie and their teenage children kenyon and nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of holcomb kansas but in the early hours of 14 november 1959 all four were brutally murdered rather unexpectedly the crime made an impression on author truman capote who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion the result was the book in cold blood controversial shocking and exceptionally well written it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day the 1967 film version of capote s work is almost as remarkable as the book itself filmed in black and white in many of the real life locations it has a slightly documentary quality icy and detached and the overall cast is exceptional this is the film on which robert blake s reputation as an actor rests and deservedly so as killer perry smith blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy it is a masterful performance from start to finish as richard hickock scott wilson is no less fine like capote s book the film opens with smith and hickock as they travel to kansas and brings them to the clutter home only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction the centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the clutter home actually filmed in the clutter house itself it is a spinechilling sequence horrific and deeply disturbing director and writer richard brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy given the overall power of the film however this becomes a trivial annoyance strong stuff and recommended gft amazon reviewer
__label__0 i ve always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i ve ever seen followed by peter pan 2 and some other sequels like the lion king 2 and the hunchback of notre dame 2 all these movies are made with the same idea because the movie has no plot they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes i m not saying the jokes are bad but they make up most of the movie the first time i saw the movie i would have given it a 1 10 but now i think about it most kids don t care how good the original movie was they just care that the movie is entertaining i still think the movie was a bad sequel but that doesn t mean it s horrible now i think it deserves a 3 10 
__label__0 the supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop standard stalk and slash picture yet well acted and directed thus making it oddly interesting and watchable though the violence isn t for the squeamish especially the director s cut which was originally given an nc 17 rating 1 2 out of 
__label__0 i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop but was disappointed on many levels first of all the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable second the setting acting and story are not very authentic or believable third there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks how about some originality third there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity if any none seemd really central overall film was a great disappointment but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile 
__label__0 this film is so bad it simply defies reality the filming is grade school material at best the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form so bad it can t even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of showgirls the only thing this dvd had going for it was the cover art all i can write to those of you who haven t had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don t waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage if you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash 
__label__0 i was interested in the title and description of big rig while attending the sxsw film festival in austin tx however i was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as big rig ended big rig is comprised of several big rig drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the united states the characters are all wonderful people however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people instead the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide but never do at most we get lost we the audience end up going nowhere and like the direction of the storytelling end up somewhere but without direction location or plot why are we here where are we how did we get here the storytelling is sloppy and the directors intent on humanizing a group of people who they regard as overlooked and invisible comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending the problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers the directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions overall the story lacks any tension the film is entirely too long should have been a 15 min sketch the big question of so what is never answered and the entire film is one piece of see through propaganda that does nothing to further enlighten as the directors claim the outside world about big riggers 
__label__1 it s a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids i felt like instead of a movie ticket i should have been given a nambla membership based upon thomas rockwell s respected book how to eat fried worms starts like any children s story moving to a new town the new kid fifth grader billy forrester was once popular but has to start anew making friends is never easy especially when the only prospect is poindexter adam or erica who at 4 1 2 feet is a giant further complicating things is joe the bully his freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting he antagonizes kids with the death ring a crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you re punched with it but not immediately no the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade joe and his axis of evil welcome billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos once discovered billy plays it cool swearing that he eats worms all the time then he throws them at joe s face ewww to win them over billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms fried boiled marinated in hot sauce squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the radioactive slime delight in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism if you ve ever met me you ll know that i have an uncontrollably hearty laugh i felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his dilly dick hurts but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting like a g rated farrelly brothers film it is both vomitous and delightful writer director bob dolman is also a savvy storyteller to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm in addition billy holds a dark secret he has an ultra sensitive stomach dolman also has a keen sense of perspective with such accuracy he draws on children s insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas if you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries you will see that it is essentially about war freedom fighter and freedom hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars only to learn a valuable lesson in unity international leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from fried worms at the end of the film i was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed that was a great movie great now i won t have to register myself in any lawful databases 
__label__0 i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female but other than that i can t really recommend this movie the characters aren t really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didn t finish the movie i d skip this one 
__label__0 it gets really bad the only half way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film there are context errors everywhere the acting is horrible save kirk the story is as holey as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie if it wasn t already a corpse so all in all it s a waste of your life i would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale 
__label__0 in 1972 after his wife left to go her own way elvis presley began dating linda thompson miss thompson a good humored long haired lovely statuesque beauty queen is charted to fill a void in elvis life when elvis divorce became final linda was already in place as the legendary performer s live in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976 this is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship linda whole heartedly tending to her lover s needs and desires and even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium at times this movie is harsh and dark of heart a very unattractive look at the king and his queen don johnson is absolutely awful as elvis over acting to the hilt is not attractive stephanie zimbalist lacks the classiness of linda but does the job pretty well supporting cast includes john crawford ruta lee and rick lenz watching this twice is more than enough for me but don t let this review stop you from checking it out for most elvis fans that i have conferred with this is not a favored presentation 
__label__0 1st watched 4 29 2007 4 out of 10 dir mick garris campy vampire like stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3 4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for king fans it s the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers a shape shifting feline like flesh eating life needing near extinct breed of humanoid who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive they come across as pretty normal upper class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down we get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack which is also a first in my movie going experience hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film the boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a sleepwalker and then he just wants her body there is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all out satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he d just get over it and bring out the gore eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it s typical stephen king downbeat ending the movie is interesting because king s humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn t cut it 
__label__1 first week of may every year brings back the memories of the holocaust through movies on televisions among many movies they showed this was the one i had not seen the story is about hilter s life and how he came to power it starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in germany the movie was earlier presented as a tv series and later converted into a movie format scottish actor robert carlyle plays adolf hitler with great guts conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this man it is a good screenplay and narrative that educates the audiences on the main events that lead hitler into power and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of hitler the movie is a biased viewpoint of the director christian duguay who shows hitler as a one track menacing angry and shouting person who had such a strong hold on the germans and people around him hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction and there the movie fails to convince hitler s portrayal even though the venture was for tv all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie the production value sets costumes etc were perfect there is a lot of criticism of this movie in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented but still the movie is gripping every engaging and entertaining robert carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does he is amazingly good brilliant i would have liked a more balanced view of hitler s life because i think hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust as i have told several times that very sadly our society loves to garland or prosecute one person as a representative of the society s good or evil respectively 
__label__0 i ll try to use words to describe this on i saw the original which was good in its own way but back then i should have feared a sequel and i was afraid when i picked this one up but now that i ve seen it i have to say it s even worse then i thought why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin let s start with the actors they aren t all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful but what can an actor do with a script like this one it s trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn t been done before fails miserably in a futile attempt to get it up to date they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole big brother theme but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the 83 original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad in conclusion if you have nothing and i mean nothing to do go watch it or play frisbee with the dvd by yourself it ll offer you the same amount of fun i promise
__label__1 first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd it is on of my favorite movies of all time i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr knightley was an excellent chose he was brilliant it s a 10 10 movie 
__label__0 jason alexander is a wonderful actor but it s ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead the fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy in his more cutesy moments with the girl in the train station in the final number with rosie i couldn t take my eyes off him he was so repellent you keep expecting him to drop the nice guy act and start snarling vanessa williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie by the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie you ll see three versions that have more revisions different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations than any other musical i ve ever seen

__label__0 a friend of mine gave me this movie a friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a dvd casing from his i got quit excited by the prospects of an other michael chabon movie after all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great but boy was i wrong first off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so i imagine the castings went something like this tell me do you like fish yes i enjoy fish very much wonder full you re hired have some money than there is the script i have read chabon who i hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel i m not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out this is an actual line from the movie if you tell me something that you ve never said out loud to anyone before than this moment becomes unique unique does it does it really off course not you plank please pass me the imodium i ll have a whole ing strip the directing is well i ve got nothing maybe rawson marshall thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something stick to directing comedies no stick to directing commercials this movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age i give it 2 stars because i don t wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie 
__label__1 i sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope i didn t think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter but it absolutely did and then some first i must say that jared harris did an extraordinary job as john lennon at times it seemed that harris was channeling lennon the resemblance was often uncanny and he clearly studied lennon s mannerisms and vocal inflections aiden quinn was quite good as mccartney also bearing a striking resemblance to macca although he did occasionally trip over his scouse accent this work of fiction was well written and well directed it was pure fantasy of course but sometimes i felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion the rooftop scene was especially moving as mccartney told lennon what he had never heard as a child that he was worthy and important and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents i also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band my one complaint would be this i am not so sure that john was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life he had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans only a few years later he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had john lived a bit longer i am quite sure the beatles would have come back together at some stage and i am quite certain that lennon and mccartney would still be friends today well done vh1 i will watch it again and again 
__label__0  1 2 for this diane keaton farce someone should tell ms keaton enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats this flick is just too much as keaton s daughter sara dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives keaton who could not be reached by phone at first as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug grieves in a new way for grievers she retreats to the summer locale where all of sara s friends are staying she cleans the house sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter in addition she had an abortion thanks to this guy we re all now put on this guilt trip her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept she also hopes that boyfriend adam who is a playwright will not include all this in another play when the diary is found it has been written in japanese sara had a ph d in this language it s not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant naturally everything seems to tie up nicely in the end the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz every time mom and sara would speak they would both utter surrender dorothy as if this isn t enough during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film interiors where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman ms keaton also tries drugs with the group come on folks can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this fair to mediocre best sums up this film 
__label__0 the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called club 905 owned run by guy johnson andrew parker lead singer dylan sean cook guitar player mike jason mckee plan to tell the other band members bass player london brooke bailey drummer nancy tom olson that they are both going solo their services won t be needed any longer once at the club dylan prepares but mike doesn t show up the gig turns into a disaster then just as the band think things couldn t get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar that all the doors have been locked so they can t get out that they can t trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one by one produced directed by juan a mas the choke is a standard by the numbers teen slasher that really doesn t have anything going for it the script by jessica dolan susannah lowber not too many horror films out there penned by ladies has some surprisingly good character s in it some nifty dialogue but while it s much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it s so slow boring that even a few interesting character s can t come anywhere close to saving it as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used from the isolated location the victims can t escape from the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up a few murders a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like scream 1996 be surprising but doesn t make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically they couldn t have done some of the things they were supposed to to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on even though i don t want to boast i was spot on then there s the fact that the makers of the choke felt that it s audience would be entertained by showing endless well it feels endless while watching it scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious the kill count is low at first they all decide to stick together good idea but then they all just randomly decide to split up go their separate ways bad idea when there s a killer on the loose the pace is lethargic the kill scenes are unimaginative to top it all off the twist ending is poor director mas does alright the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping the gore levels aren t really up to scratch there s some blood splatter a guy with a hole in his chest a few dead bodies someone impaled on some metal poles most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything since the film is about a rock band there s quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible horrible rock songs used on it i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution it s not scary there s no real atmosphere the lack of blood gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look shot in a place called spokane in washington apparently the acting is one of the films strongest points as it s generally pretty good all round i mean no one is going to win an oscar but it ain t half bad the choke is a throughly routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever a criminal lack of blood gore violence nudity dead bodies i mean if a slasher hasn t got any sex or gore then what s the point those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for right 
__label__0 i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much it seems that disney however is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight to dvd sequels they deserve a razzie several in fact i thought the idea had merit but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn t much better what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films mary poppins aladdin beauty and the beast the lion king even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame they ve made so many great movies over the years that it s really sad that they ve sunk to point of making sequels that aren t even good enough to put in theatres i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation 
__label__1 first there is no way the remake can be as good because japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film as explained in the opening narration it adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie there is slew of different supporting characters personalities each does there part in making this movie wonderful this movie is full of comedy that isn t vulgar in anyway like most of today s gross out comedies yet it can still have you laughing out loud the reality is in real life you don t have a choice of who you work with or go to school with etc this movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences not to mention it makes for a great sub plot and much of the humor this is a story about dance that actually has a story and a good one at that there are a few back stories that are not out of place but actually support the main storyline truly a well written film the dancing is great too i happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort for that aspect however this movie goes beyond any other with dance in the fact that it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in japanse society highly recommended 10 out of 10 
__label__0 tv version of twister springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable my sister bought this at a wal mart a few years back when it was released i saw it back then and thought it was okay later twister with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out or was it before i think it was 97 and did a better job overall but twister was more silly fun this is realistic with a message it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a low budget character study john schneider and devon sawa he s the reason my sister bought it star and devon sawa who went on to wild america final destination and slackers got his big break here so in a way i was one of the first people to see him really take off i don t know if it s an honor or a shame i haven t seen how he acts in recent films night of the twisters all depends on personal taste like i said it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a low budget character study night of the twister has the latter so you decide i give it a 2 5 5 john ulmer
__label__1 the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible ordeal the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen as well as fine performances by ned beatty ronny cox bill mckinney and though he appeared only briefly james dickey the man who authored the book upon which the film is based as the sheriff of aintry it is somewhat disturbing and kids of course should be shielded from it but this is great dramatic cinema 
__label__0 let me tell you something about this movie i have seen it twice the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me i really liked it i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool i saw it again a few days ago it was horrible really i don t know why i thought it was funny before but now i didn t laugh at all there was nothing even slightly entertaining it was just dumb the story was weak the acting was nothing special there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist really don t get me wrong usually i don t complain about racism in movies however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like the shaolin temple or about the fact that the only black man in the street fighter is one of the bad guys or whatever you get the point there are people seeing racism everywhere i wonder how would they react to a movie like the meteor man why i will tell you why there are no asians in this movie there are no white people among the good guys in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys all the good guys are african americans don t get me wrong i don t care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen it is just not realistic if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with the street fighter there is no problem in japan most of the people are asians but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem in usa most of the people are white it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy just not real that is it i am giving the movie the rate of 4 10 it would be 1 10 if i hadn t have fun with it as a kid 
__label__0 i saw this film a while ago on a video cd i will 1st mention the good points the movie at first at least tries to appear that it is not biased like not showing one character as black and the other as white both main characters are friends and co exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport sport rifle shooting as comrades not as competitors but after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict sure the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began the history the 1990 elections the people who caused the war are not mentioned the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliament s 2nd largest party sdp according to the constitution of bosnia the sdp was to have the presidency in 1992 but there was a coup in january the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secession the history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic a man suspiciously absent from stth he was a student of nazism in ww2 he even wrote his own mein kampf in which he stated it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between the islamic religion and non islamic social and political institutions in 1990 he lost the idap elections to pro yugoslavia moderate fikret abdic a bosnian muslim that worked with christian serbs during the civil war and who treated his supporters like brothers abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic who lost the elections but seized the seat of power the events from above are missing from the movie but they are the factual events that lead to the war there were problems with props too serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 helmets which they did not use also the one soldier was holding an m 1944 ww2 rifle only used by ussr not yugoslavia the director and script writers had a chance but they chose to re write history 
__label__0 this film is just another distortion among many distortions on the so called sins of consumerism please note that reverend billy an actor bill talen is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the sins of consumerism we might want to ask are questions like what does reverend billy do for a living how does he make his money does he make his living off his tax deductible organization how does the internal revenue justify this as a tax deductible church or organization everyone knows that christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families everyone is not charitable everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families but holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity yes america does have more than its share of problems but with perseverance americans have and always make it through great difficulties and even in times of strife america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world that happens when americans pull together and unite rather than to separate and divide yes there are problems with corporations and monopolies but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities yes globalization has brought us its share of problems but it will take americans to bring production back to america americans and the u s government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our dependence on credit our over reliance on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave it is important to buy but if we buy less we will rely less on credit and if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day not to say that as americans we will gain an equal share of wealth wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed but stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america s wealth there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper middle class and who knows what can happen from there be positive work hard and at the very least you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams in life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for and if you or i don t have dreams we might as well be dead in america there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams as individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the pack it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives but as far as the distortions expressed within this film i do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives i rank this film with a 1 out of 10 but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero this film has no integrity and i cannot recommend it

__label__1 first of all i ve got to give it to the people that got this thing together 9 11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts it s a shame although not surprising that the movie was banned in the us that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of majid majidi s work the absolutely beautiful heaven s children and the color of paradise much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of afgan refugees in iran absolutely beautiful clip same goes for sean penn s clip which is superb as well but just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal alejandro gonzáles iñárritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut wrenching amores perros he does it as brutal as he can most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families those who were angry and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers a very hard clip to watch and one that you won t forget some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as you re not the only ones that are suffering in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people i will also make a special mention to the clips from bosnia herzegovina france india and japan although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn t however not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which in my opinion is extremely weak while the idea was good a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to the realization is terrible the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air time at all costs a guy saying he s a witness and hoping that he can go on tv and soldiers and paramedics shouting just because the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should that is unless you re a conservative in which case you d better stay out as you might get offended but if you re not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through 9 11

__label__0 they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone s vague recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasn t so misleading i d give it a better review but seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood film the book stuart little isn t about a mouse it s about a person who happens to be very small and mouse like he s born to his parents not adopted the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on there is a cat named snowball who thinks he s food and wants to eat him but snowball can t talk in the movie they screw all of that up i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names 
__label__1 after reading the other tepid reviews and comments i felt i had to come to bat for this movie roeg s films tend to have little to do with one another and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith the only other film like it in terms of its religious message would have to be tolkin s the rapture i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural it is a simple movie about catholic faith miracles and redemption though you would never guess it till the end it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns literally on a pun as a happily fallen catholic myself i know what the movie is about and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based then it will go right over you head as a film as opposed to a story cold heaven it is not ground breaking while the rapture is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery cold heaven downplays its own cinematic qualities there are no striking shots no edgy effects no attempts to fit the content to the form it is workmanlike shooting but subdued nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama it is a simple story that unfolds simply it may seem odd but at the end the mystery is revealed it looks ambiguous but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma in this regard cold heaven has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like the sting or the sixth sense or final descent or polanski s a pure formality all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves they may frustrate you along the way but they have a point an obvious one indeed but the fun is at least in part in having been taken in still even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line it is worth watching for way it directs and misdirects you try it especially if you are or have ever been a catholic

__label__1 well i was a teenager when i saw the movie the songs were a huge hit but the elite class skipped govinda movies back then coz watching govinda and karishma aka karizma movies were not the in thing for that class but anyways a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies rocked the 90 s through out and most of them were successful today i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered there was a long que of people and the riot they created when the a aa e uo uo o song came on screen the dresses of govinda and karishma were complimentary to each other the worst dressing duo of that time well karisma in the late 90 s transformed but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer as his dress sense remains the same but back then it all blended it was all good everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it was missing and then there was no looking back for this jodi as it went on n on making those indian carry on series hated by a few but loved by the masses if you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on tv i don t think you will regret it but remember its the worst at its best still i watch those movies when i get time coz i cant stop laughing so i say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when its done by the kings of their times it surely is watchable i recommend it to all movie lovers 
__label__0 this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i ve ever seen and that s saying something the chant of viva chiba viva chiba is heard at the title soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid stupid the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them of course that s our man sonny chiba the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard but what are her true intentions let me say at this point who cares soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills end of story oh yeah the woman was corrupt too congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film that s probably the most entertaining part of the film and it s beyond funny i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70 s karate scene was at the time watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student bad editing punching him in the throat but everything is badly done in this film terrible unbelievable fights fake i mean fake blood bad acting dubbing wardrobe and let s not forget the story one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country i bet fight after fight is laughable this was the 70 s when people still believed karate was effective in a fight but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie let s see he kicks a gun in half kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene give me a break not to mention the fact that it s very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it s filmed so poorly one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture ok as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood really fake blood too say it looked poorly made is and understatement the acting is totally non existent in this film i don t expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good but it wasn t and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent as expected from a 70 s wardrobe you ll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time don t try and hide it now the characters were stupid as well the pimp club owner s one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling it was very annoying overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making that doesn t mean that it s not entertaining with a film made so poorly it s hard not to laugh through most of this film if you can stomach it this was an old favorite watch with my best friend if it was purely bad i would give one star but the laughs it delivers bumps it up 4 out 10 
__label__0 i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
__label__0 what a boring film to sum it all up its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter in law karisma kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasn t too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hours of it the best part of the whole movie was the song ishq kamina and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was a piece of crap 
__label__0 it at all you have seen when harry met sally then avoid this one it will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can t bollywood even make a good remake but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it the charm of the movie is missing ranee looks terrible saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor the plots that have been picked up from the original don t look effective either the part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note it just doesn t look appealing what can be more disastrous you wanna waste some money this is what you can get otherwise put some more bucks and watch the original its too good to miss 
__label__0 the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it the characters were stereotypical white trash the movie s plot was stunted from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny regretfully that was the only funny thing in the movie ms jenkins would be better served if in the future she would refrain from using her life story to entertain people it was simply that bad the one positive aspect of this movie this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker 
__label__1 the movie follows the events of the novel cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni could be translated as the most beloved among humans written by marin preda a very controversial book and movie a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet very popular and hard to get due to its satiric contents over the communist regime it represents the drama of the intellectual man the humanist in a red world a movie filled with passion fear sexuality all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe one of the greatest romanian movies despite its psychological charge after all it is an european movie 
__label__1 it s easy to make really general comments about a film like this the fact that it s one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it started japanese cinema and was unlike anything the west ever made the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off caligari on more than one occasion but style was meant to be imitated and doesn t take away from this film s importance what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities for this purpose the madhouse is the ideal setting and the writers knew this this is a landmark film and every effort should be made to track it down 5 out of 5 essential
__label__0 if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action a few of the actors i ve seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better all the special effects are done by the great rondo whom performs all the magic whit his mind a cult movie is written on the box does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving 
__label__1 hello playmates i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey i have to admit i was very impressed by this film as a fan of black and white films generally passport to pimlico the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder who is apparently a distant relative this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey s performance however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it shame these films generally aren t shown on sunday afternoons anymore i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley private godfrey in dad s army i thank you
__label__1 okay here s what i think about jack frost i looked at the morphing box for the vhs tape and i thought to myself this looks interesting i rent it and i take it home boy was i right it is interesting they put serial killer s spirits in dreams in walking corpses and inside every day machines but this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer inside the body of a snowman i liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape the pot holder the snow globe etc i like the actor who played jack he put some fun into a killer really not seen since freddy krugger that s right i said it freddy krugger it s that level of cool i wish some of the puppet effects were better the mouth movements could have matched better but i chalk that up to a small budget the cast does a great job there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump all and all a great story good effects great dialog and a great cast i give jack frost 9 stars
__label__1 i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise i didn t cared much about tom cruise s acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character they merge and then speak and its beautiful however i must say this movie doesn t come under the average flick of weekend which you pick at random and watch gleefully it carries strong sentiments and characters so don t wash this one down with your beer and pop corns it certainly needs more than that 
__label__0 having just watched this movie i almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life but i guess there is some good in everything if i was to rate this as any other movie it can only receive 1 or 2 tops but if i grade it like a low budget ind movie it may get 3 or 4 that is a movie is supposed to be complete and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time this movie isn t but i guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills and considering this this movie has a few highlights if i am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project i guess the distorted sound effects had some quality they also manage to build some characters this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project because the character building takes too long since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project whats the point i guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything building characters suspense and a plot and ends up being nothing not a lot this movie tries too much and too hard and i guess it should have been cut to a short film i could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie there is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie the story should have been more streamlined i know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie but a slight surprise to who the killer is doesn t make a mystery the story behind the mystery receives almost no attention during the film which leaves the final point as a quick an unsatisfying wrap up therefore i would like to say this movie was a nice try but i cant i hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time if you don t have an interest in bench learning from producing low budget movies there is no need to watch this not even too see why everyone thinks its bad as others have stated i am pretty sure the many 10 s given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie this movie could not receive a 10 judging from any remotely objective standpoint 
__label__1  bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times it s a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered dead video tape laserdisc and dvd that should tell you something 
__label__0 usually i don t think hollywood productions are fit to be called film so i call them movies instead but this piece of elephant manure is not even fit to be called a movie hence the quotes in the title where shall i start 1 if this isn t the start of geriatric casting it sure is the epitome of it stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age she s supposed to play an 18 year old and she is forty effing two 2 a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france where we see cliché characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shop owner the bitchy queen of models the fairy god mother ex queen of models etc this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy 3 it s highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place especially if the whole focus is about that4 the horrible accents 5 the nana mouskouri elevator music i could go on but i think this is enough and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations i mean i invite everyone to add to my list p d:) :P :D
__label__0 how can barry levinson possibly assemble white hot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black the gorgeous rachel weisz old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker stiller and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi millionaire the premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand every chance they can stiller and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges stiller s character to take revenge it s a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce 
__label__0 this film is something like a sequel of white zombie since it is made by the same man halperin and features zombies halperin the george a romero of his day fails to deliver with this one though we have a man who can control the minds of people in cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free also a love interest for the evil man where this film really excels is in the imagery the cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers unfortunately we don t really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on i would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver and no strong villain like bela lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes and the use of lugosi s eyes a nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film why not recreate this with the new actor s eyes overall a film that could be a great one with a little script re working and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same post war time frame heck if they can fix up the hills have eyes then this film has hope 
__label__1 the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it but this movie caught me off guard it wasn t what i was expecting at all it s been a while since i ve seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing and it wasn t just the cast that did it for me the script was amazingly written every time you were expecting something to happen it didn t happen there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really can t say anything bad about this movie expcept i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time 
__label__0 so back when herbie made his first appearance i was perfectly happy watching dean jones mug away i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn now unfortunately i have expectations of a riveting delightful story whenever i watch a movie if i m not on some sort of medication and this is another good movie for the medicated there are no major laughs no complex plot lines no difficult twists herbie fully loaded is great for the fully loaded this was the first time i had seen la lohan on the screen since she swapped places with jamie lee curtis i thought she was excellent in that and i can t say i was terribly impressed this time around aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color she just didn t ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers her need for speed wasn t portrayed consistently in the film perhaps it was elsewhere she looked older than her part and seemed to always be looking for something a party designer togs new place to spend money off set i couldn t see any chemistry with justin long that romance seemed obligatory at best the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with matt dillon who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy it was great to see herbie again and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies if disney had popped out with some car 53 jewelry i might have worn some just to be loyal his new feature was a little inconsistent does he channel the thoughts of his driver does he now skateboard but whatever we all knew how it was going to end but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had hammered home what would have made the movie worthwhile have the old herbie in a real story with a real plot at the very least herbie s as good as lassie but clearly that s asking too much why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as herbie goes bananas and the computer that wore tennis shoes when it comes to innovation i m sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations for the rest of us it s for when you have the flu and just can t take the suspense of rear window 
__label__1 offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so called fire starters think stephen king s snore fest of a book with the same name but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac good special effects especially towards the end quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make wilder napalm a unique treat of a film to watch if you can find it that is on a personal note i was fortunate enough to snatch it up so to speak from the two dollar bin at my local video rental store out of 
__label__1 if you have sons or daughters who love action adventure intrigue and imagination without the need to break into song every twelve minutes then this is the disney movie for you my sons loved every minute of this film and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right this should go down as one of the disney classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non stop excitement 
__label__0 i awake suddenly aware that i m drooling onto the plastic couch cover and realize it s a warm saturday afternoon why was i sleeping did i hit my head or accidentally swallow all of my grandma s muscle relaxers could it be adult onset narcolepsy no i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out it s that head shaking mouth agape shoulder shrugging bad but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me and when he she woke up a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep no one will now how awful it is and he she can keep the 425 000 annual salary you ve been warned 
__label__0 two qualifiers right up front i actually think joe don baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director the cape fear remake a small role in goldeneye walking tall and i even liked baker in mitchell because he was playing an anti hero who was supposed to be unlikeable yes mst3k s coverage was hilarious but they took a lot of cheap shots at baker that he didn t deserve to keep things lively and entertaining he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie and he was the best part of the movie final justice seems to be more of the same but in spite of the exotic locations and the cowboy frontier justice theme it is quite a bit weaker than mitchell and the main reason is that baker s character as written is an idiot the movie has the conceit that because baker embodies old style frontier machismo he challenges his opponents to old style mano a mano quick draw contests and because he s so tough and macho he always wins even when he s hurt wounded outnumbered etc that s a conceit with a lot of potential it worked for gary cooper even if it condemns the film to b movie status but baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy s henchman to a showdown in a public market with civilians all over the place he could have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guy s headquarters which was why he was following them in the first place and they never would have noticed or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point but no he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout this is a guy we are supposed to admire the whole movie is basically like this most of the supporting actors are somewhere between ok the henchmen to pretty good the chief bad guy and his father who are two well known european actors they just go through the motions but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent but through it all baker s character pulls silly unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force on the positive side since 90 of the movie is set on malta or in the mediterranean you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras and really baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic but he isn t that bad certainly not the tub o lard that this films critics including mike and the bots in their hilarious coverage seem to think in short this movie is good for video wallpaper but the viewer should not pay any attention to it 
__label__0 man oh man what a piece of crummy film making but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time where i grew up in san jose california right on the border of cupertino we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again wanda nevada was one of those movies i fell in lust and love with the young brooke shields and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the 1940s the script makes almost no sense the direction is poor the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance a lot of dialog that s so bad it s good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick and hey everybody knows there ain t no gold in the grand canyon 
__label__1 does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivy s apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevators charles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husband s lawyer but again i don t recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot him herbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film 
__label__1 maybe one of the most entertaining ninja movies ever made a hard hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion eehaaa made in 83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far and we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel ninja mission 2000 the legacy of markov 
__label__0 this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of deja vu don t be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it doesn t get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is mediocre the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn t fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie 
__label__1 a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store and picking stuff just because i haven t seen it a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones he made this better than average drama watching it you begin to notice how many decent good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large preferably large and unsubtle and scandalous kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director um no thanks his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot the plague is coming but here s an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope here s an almost watchable barabra bel geddes with her bathos turned way down well for her they re a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones here s an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew here s a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment these are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life something hollywood in its greed now studiously avoids these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them it s a personable human scaled film not the grotesque overscaled production that he and others david lean will later popularize whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge i just watched it twice and i ll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes but it doesn t seem that important to me as a viewer this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain and naked city which you should really get your hands on 
__label__1 this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies although his majesty mr kinski is missing you still have young joachim blacky fuchsberger starring once again as the typical clever american womanizer you have young eddi arendt in his best and just as well typical role ever the cool sophisticated british butler and you have not so young anymore lowitz as the melancholic yet very dry ironic and thus highly entertaining police investigator furthermore you ll get offered a freakish and very campy evil guy behind a frog mask hence the movie s title you ll get a crazed out swinging soundtrack classic b movie action scenes partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives please remind the time of its origin yelling scream queens and on and on all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness highly recommended 
__label__1 i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a person s interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father s face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this aren t made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure 
__label__0 first of all f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft secondly the f14 s and f18 s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers thirdly the f16 has only one m61 cannon not two last but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing f18 s and f14 s being mysteriously transformed into f16 s this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 when students hand in really bad work teachers assign 0 s now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a 0 10 option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 
__label__1 if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes ka den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didn t stop delivering what he s infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn t be ignored but it s not at all a fault of kurosawa s the material in dodes ka den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there s things that happen to these people and kurosawa s challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there s not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man child who goes around all day making train sounds the clickety clack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there s the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site specific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he s lost a lot more than he ll tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i m not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social around there are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there s the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there s a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it s about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it s a little post apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it s a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it sometimes there s charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawa s cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they ve always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them i e the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it s one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it s like the abstract has come full throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it s a brilliant tricky double edged sword that allows for the dream like intonations with such heavy duty drama with a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodes ka den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality 
__label__0 this film once sensational for its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the radicalism of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60 s youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its self consciousness with respect to the fourth wall every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle

__label__1 i didn t know what to expect from ned kelly but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800 s i ve never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia s most notorious killer naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly s society lover highly recommended and that s from an aussie 
__label__0 i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself the devil she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy maidens are chained up the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner peter weston is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her 
__label__1 answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is creepier nastier and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth the acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the less than wonderful script it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable young anthony de marco as jake puts in a particularly good performance fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog try it especially if you re not a monster fan this is not a horror flick even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film jake s closet is suitable for mature adults the whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts 
__label__1 although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special if you ve never seen this film before you ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney s aladdin cribbed from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers i ve given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting it doesn t kill the film but it does weaken it still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie 
__label__1 just came back from the first showing of basic instinct 2 i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy 2 just as much if not more great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking the music is superb reprising the original s theme don t go expecting academy award material go to see it for enjoyment and fun that s what movies are designed for escapism i can t think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was am thinking about going to see it again this weekend go see it 
__label__0 i had to walk out of the theater after an hour all i was seeing was people cheating on wives schtupping like dogs in a rut and using the f word like a diabetic using equal no thanks it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate talk about it and swear at each other the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1 several murders occur 2 vinnie sees murder scene 3 vinnie stares moodily across atlantic east hudson river 4 vinnie cheats on wife and 5 joey most sympathetic character in the show gets kicked out of his parents house more than that i didn t wait to see the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb but there was nothing for them to do the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happen sorry spike take some lessons from notting hill or shawshank redemption either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships

__label__0 i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the hands down worst film i ve seen this year worse than even catwoman which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction in september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife s death on sept 11 to track down osama bin laden they made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentary the psychotic idiotic protagonist who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i don t know why he didn t just wear a sign on his back that said shoot me the crew s translator supposedly their sensible voice of reason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom you wish they d brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons around tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew 
__label__0 wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent 8 weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at check in and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if super efficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it well forgive me but didn t they already have her daddy ready for slaughter so you better oughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore wouldn t it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important call required or even cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists keep the dumb dad in distress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist assassin couldn t the massive bazooka missile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the 50th story of a miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they ll speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for 8 weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow star trek style gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to perhaps get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as 1 bazooka 2 car 3 boom my 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid cod hitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no cctv then i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops her allies or getting on the blower at a call box direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhood watch district crushing the front porch in the process an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who aren t even mildly curious thus ensuring 15 more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast hollodeck type house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all cillian surely renamed silly un for doing this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i d better stop because the stream of drivel i m writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams hadn t been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from red eye to no eye dear rr

__label__1 after star wars a new hope redefined science fiction and the empire strikes back redefined star wars it s hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what s going on in the war there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion s final confrontation with the emperor when the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land including han solo chewbacca and leia the battle raging on in space including lando and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star which leads up to another duel with darth vader it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no escape although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far fetched it didn t seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well with the light tone of a new hope and the more sinnister tone of the empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale the special edition for return of the jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not much of the original really needed it fifteen years of technology advancements didn t seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good the gaping non threatening sarlaac s mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly trap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense also the disco was taken out of jabba s palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small ewok village which was the case of the original and that didn t really end a story this big the way it deserved it s hard to say which of the three films was the best but since it s all part of the same story the over all trilogy is like one big outstanding film a third must see for film fans 
__label__0 medellin is a fabulous place to live work and study i ve been there twice and never did i hear anything about guerrilla activities paramilitaries taking tourists hostage or anything of the sort there are invisible police but it is not a big brother system there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life but they do not hassle someone without good reasons la sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters the directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of la sierra and when a character dies there is genuine pathos it is difficult to imagine however that the three youths are all members of the bloque metro a gang that used to terrorize la sierra before the colombian government began to restructure the country la sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in colombia there are of course things to be wary of such as petty crime but when one considers pickpocketing happens in modern cities such as london new york or tokyo colombia doesn t seem that different after all colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war torn country is now prospering more than ever 
__label__1 the cinematic interests in the british monarchy continues with the young victoria 1837 to 1901 after having seen in recent years the efforts with keira knightley s the duchess cate blanchett s elizabeth films and scarlett johansson and natalie portman s take on the boleyn sisters with the other boleyn girl more contemporary stories would include helen mirren s award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess diana s death each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ok so some may dispute johansson or were the flavour of their moment and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character s legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films however the young victoria as the title already suggests is a lite version of the young queen s life and if you re looking for that definitive event or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady self serving politicians unfortunately there s nothing of depth here that s not to say the young victoria is without directed by canadian jean marc vallee best known for crazy and written by julian fellowes this film chronicles in very plain terms the life and times of victoria emily blunt soon becoming the new it girl when she was a child the troubles she faced before coronation such as the eagerness of her mom the duchess of kent miranda richardson and her adviser sir john conroy mark strong to appoint themselves as joint regent to her throne as already planned for by reigning king william jim broadbent as if that wasn t enough the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne paul bettany being a prime minister in waiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace on one hand you d understand the need for a young and new queen to have trusted people in key positions but on the other are they really acting in her interests or in the interests of others even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert rupert friend where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film and pretty much everything already included in the trailers for both they ve been brought up under the influence of others and told each step of the way exactly what to do even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding and to do so with the help of each other instead of being pawns there s this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling and at times absurd rules and regulations trust also becomes a much valued commodity and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean however all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative from childhood to romance marriage and children in fact there s so much fast forwarding here especially the last few minutes filled with inter titles that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more and room of course for another movie which i suspect would probably not see the light of day but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film s response and come out with a mini series or such it s a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes sets and art direction would be confined to a film that s quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues that they don t really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character defining adversary with its star studded cast one would expect more but one would be left wanting more instead recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british monarchy only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned 
__label__1 this movie is visually stunning who cares if she can act or not each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek the locations set designs and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty youth and wealth in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek s story and this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn s role as father mentor lover and his portrayal of a man of men lost to a bygone era when men were men there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence containment and security yes they do not make men like that anymore but then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek 
__label__1 a lot of talk has been made about psychological westerns but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre it has big name stars who perform very well but it is the director who makes this such a good movie stewart granger loses his british safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the west as one of the best robert taylor plays the upstart in contrast to the usual young upstart taylor s character is middle aged too who wants to slaughter buffalo and lures granger into business with him they hire two other big name actors lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn into being their skinners granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct knowing if they become extinct the native american way of life will greatly suffer taylor soon reveals a sadistic side but it is a realistic saidism unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film created by nerds and dorks he is insecure and needs human companionship still he won t stop at murder the end pits the two against each other with a startling conclusion the psychological effects of what they re doing are well depicted

__label__0 i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one s heard of and could be a possible gem i saw this and since i m a fan of violence and gore i got it it got the rating of em which means extremely mature thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else i got it the warning on the box said extreme violence extreme langauge and nudity the extreme violence struck my fancy the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick it had one or two gory scenes but i ve seen worse in a pg 13 movie of course the amount of gore in a movie isn t all that counts right you have plot also well the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it don t rent it i speak the truth i can t imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say i m gonna rent that again it had it s moments where it kept you going but i m never going to see that film again 
__label__1 just saw this tonight at a seminar on digital projection shot on 35mm and first feature film fully scanned in 6k mastered in 4k and projected with 2k projector at etc usc theater in hwd so much for tech stuff 18 directors including alexander payne wes cravens joel and ethan coen gus van sant walter salles and gerard depardieu among several good french international directors were each given 5 minutes to make a love story they come in all shapes and forms with known actors elijah wood natalie portman steve buscemi totally hilarious maggie glyllenhall nick nolte geena rowlands soo good and she actually wrote the piece she was in msr depardieu and many good international actors as well the stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to alex payne s touching study of a woman discovering herself to van sant and one of those things that happens anywhere maybe nothing really off putting by having french spoken in most sequences with english subtitles and a small amount of actual english spoken though that will probably relegate it to art houses a la diva also only one piece that might be considered experimental but colorful and funny as well the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships all easy to follow unless the experimental one irritates your desire for a formulaic story several brought up some emotions for me i admit i am affected by love in cinema when it is presented in something other than sentimentality i even laughed at a mime piece like no other i have seen thank you for that the film hit its peak for me somewhere around a little more than half way through then the last two sequences picked up again some beautiful shots of paris at night lush romantic kind of music usually used to good effect not just schmaltz for emotions in sound generally good cinematography though some shots seemed soft focus when it couldn t have meant to have been main character in shot scene pacing of each film was good and overall structure though a bit long they left out two of what was to be 20 films but said all would be on the dvd seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance not sure when it comes out but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work and sometimes what doesn t work if it covers too much time emotionally for a short film should be in region one when released but they didn t know when 
__label__0 serum starts as eddie derek phillips is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an md like his father richard dennis o neill his uncle eddie david h hickey however his joy could be short lived as eddie is involved in an accident is run over by a car taken to the nearest hospital it doesn t look good for poor eddie so his uncle eddie convinces his brother richard to let him save eddie with the serum he has developed a serum which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness desperate for his boy to live richard agrees but the procedure has unwanted side effects like turning eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thing executive produced written directed by steve franke i ll be perfectly frank myself say serum is awful serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to rip off other any number of other s ends up being slightly more fun than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers the script is terrible it has the whole re animator 1985 feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge syringes trying to eradicate death but it s so boring it s untrue the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home after spending some time away finding his ex girlfriend has hooked up with someone else arguments with his step mom getting drunk with his mate generally boring the audience stiff so once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get eddie re animated then he kills a couple of people police catch up with him shoot him the end thank god serum is devoid of any of the characteristic s that one would associate with a good film the character s suck the dialogue is poor it takes itself far too seriously it s dull it s slow it s forgettable considering it s meant to be a horror film there s an alarming lack of blood gore or horror not recommended did i mention serum was boring i thought so director franke does nothing to liven this thing up although competent there s no style here at all the gore levels are none existent there s a bit of splashed blood a bitten neck a couple of scars on a dead woman s face a couple of scenes where a needle pierces skin that s it don t expect a re animator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed much like i was in fact filmed in what looks like one house one restaurant a lab the film has no variety either just looks cheap throughout there s a couple of scenes of nudity but that s nowhere near enough to save it technically the film isn t too bad at least it looks like proper cameras were used i can t really comment on the special effects because there aren t any but generally speaking serum looks reasonably professional apparently shot in texas or should that read it should have literally been shot in texas the acting sucks although again i think they were proper actor s rather than friends or family of the director serum is a terrible film it s dull slow boring has no gore feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes i don t understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch re animator or one of it s sequels again instead seriously i recommend you give serum a miss there i ve just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life you can thank me later 
__label__0 yes this movie make me feel real horror when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it the bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting i m always supporting independent movies when it deserves the support but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies i m still traumatized i will not trust in any nice cover anymore 
__label__1 when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature i was right a bug s life like toy story is great story great characters and great animation my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick david hyde pierce lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich s like you hoo mr early bird how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim s like i m going to snap i m going to snap i just died laughing at that scene being a big fan of insects i think a bug s life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever i don t know how you could hate a pixar film i think they re all pretty good films good job pixar 
__label__0 one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film ascript existed that made any sense was the rough cut 3 hourslong and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives why would anyone finance this mess i will say that tomwlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canwith the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given butcharacters come and go for no apparent reason continuity isnon existent and the acting cinematography and direction are toput it politely amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunatechoice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyoneactually attempt to actually watch this film 
__label__0 the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call girl the other an upper class political party the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as the godfather as here as a little servant see also donnie brasco actually the big young lion has become a tired old one this passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too but his slowness is only a make up because he can get back his energy in church scene maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al s talent 
__label__0 this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along 1 2 
__label__1 here i thought nanook of the north was the last word in archaic semi doc eskimo movies how wrong as an avid sea kayaker i stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand made skin boats the movie did not let me down any student of kayak umiak construction should have a look see here note to fellow skers they appear to be using norton sound kayaks with single blade paddles but the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest even though there were as others have noted some little back shot fakey bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance it was from this very amateur anthropologist s viewpoint probably the perfect time to make this movie early thirties the talkies are so new that they including louie b mayer actually let the inuit speak in their own tongue and there is so much that was still despite the infused melodrama authentic they are really whacking that polar bear that whale and those caribou a fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with stars technicolor etc to gum it up the seventies version don t even a very good companion piece to this excellent movie is white shadows in the south seas 1928 geograpically the mirror image to eskimo it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of western culture technology on an unsuspecting people 
__label__0 is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you ll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didn t have much of a budget compared to spielberg s herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an insurmountable handicap i ve seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielberg s budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he s foisted on us primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show he s returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour that s all that happens ok i ll grant that one extended excursion from the main character s house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it s a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a first year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkity yak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessert thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g wells text else we d have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone can t convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks he s a filmmaker so he s content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesn t need dazzling technical effects some really potent sci fi s have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects don t need to be complex they can even be crude e g fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal byron haskins 1953 version but they must be handled well unfortunately hines effects are both crude and incompetent tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect that s less than convincing fine we can work around that just don t use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away it s not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please don t show it twice but no hines won t listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those 180 minutes somehow boy next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks he s getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree let s have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they aren t even good amateurs but this needn t prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting that s what directors are for and editors which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if america s butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a herky jerky effect that s nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890 s if he was i can say he doesn t know how to do it 
__label__1 miike makes a children s adventure film not unlike the neverending story it s actually one of my least favorite of the director s films even the worst miike is better than a good many films though and the great yokai war has a lot in it that s worth recommending it s at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it the dvd includes an english dub but like all of miike s films it can tend to move very slowly that means you ve got kind of a weird unevenness where sometimes there s a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse the story itself isn t very good either and miike s perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head most of what i liked came from the technical side of things this has to be miike s most expensive movie and it looks fantastic yokai are japanese spirits and they come in all different fantastical forms and the costume designers special effects crew and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job i ve seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on yokai monsters spook warfare and the cheesy rubber suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state of the art makeup and special effects i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys or girls in this case agi who sports dark eye shadow a tight white outfit a white beehive hairdo and a whip she s played incidentally by chiaki kuriyama whom you might remember as lucy liu s teenage henchgirl in kill bill vol 1 the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki who provided voices for miyazaki s spirited away and howl s moving castle 
__label__1 a much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever declining spiral of domestic violence at times difficult to watch while morris day is portrayed as the misogynist prince as the knight on motorcycle steed he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and wendy lisa even further two of his compositions computer blue admittedly the album s weakest track and darling nikki are shown as being songs that kill off an audience perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a card that lists the slightly shorter than prince apollonia as 5 6 the nearly complete amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they ve never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point and do perfectly well under the direction morris day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham though jerome benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well particularly their stage act which is hilarious day and benton even go so far as to make an abbott and costello routine funny which takes some doing lastly there s prince while i admit to bias i do actually think he s a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low key version of himself acting isn t his profession this was a film made for entertainment so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn t robert deniro and thinking they re making a point is sadly deluded i don t want this review to be a derisory attack of other people s comments but i ve even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit how would a film about domestic violence be shot then with full overhead spotlights and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame the film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths and this isn t some retro recreation prince s best film with oscar winning music it sees him at his zenith and it s saddening to realise that even though he would make some fine albums he would never again capture this high 
__label__0 what a disappointment i hated the mummy but this one was even worse it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time i can t believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas cage wasn t very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america s most wanted buildings the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn t very convincing either i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment what a drag i guess i ve just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure 
__label__0 not sure if i m referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director devil hunter sure is one bizarre horror movie the plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like cannibal ferox and cut and run chick gets kidnapped in the jungle by a tribe of savages the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp to make matters worse this film has ultra minimal gore no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis not fun i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro trash film this one just fell way short 2 out of 10 kids 
__label__1 i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters lindy and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life s tragic disarray the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip news media crowds mobs and assumptions it s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it s merely an account of a true story that happened there society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one s own unaware perceptions influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one s life the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the masses the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside suspicion was jet fueled mostly by a virtue of hers to the public eye she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up for tv and the press how much of the downward spiral could ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public s liking in the media meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of film making but she and the screenwriters do understand lindy what is infuriating is that it s not that difficult apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie s choice the devil wears prada angels in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself she frustrates us because we don t know what she s thinking or feeling it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her but this is the movie s way of suggesting the reaction of the public s attention she is married to a pastor and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most initially they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god s will kick starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media s intake didn t immediately identify so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry well meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen but the australian public plays the real leads here like punctuation for each plot advance director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections this golan globus docudrama is not particularly memorable the setting s atmosphere doesn t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public 
__label__1 eric clapton jack bruce and ginger baker re unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called cream those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it all skinny very long hair wild clothes and loud music they played a combination of rock and blues and it was for the most part good stuff well these guys are now 60 something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us i was always extremely familiar with clapton of course who has never been out of the limelight but i didn t know what to expect from bruce and baker neither of whom i hadn t seen in decades they surprised me when he was young baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death now he looks healthy in shape and his drum playing was solid bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they re doing some people criticized this show for being low key i don t agree with that i have no complaints the concert sounded very good the second song spoonful was outstanding the highlight of the concert for me highly recommended 
__label__1 this film is like an allegory of the gospel it has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when italy was ravaged and devastated and was filled with a huge homeless impoverished population it is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration toto is a character like doestoevisky s idiot a modern christ finding his way in a big city he is goodness and purity fortified by love and his acts change the people he encounters as much as the miracle working dove the story is told in a natural manner and simple style yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of fellini s surrealist fantasies it is one of the most inspiring uplifting movies ever made 
__label__0 this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i couldn t even follow it the acting is high schoolish the sound track is irritating the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible the credits are even slow i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film don t waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting 
__label__1 spoiler this movie is about such a concept williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school finally the under dog get its shot and williams can save face instead of being the clown a great reverse tragedy 7 10
__label__1 i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted however i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she is the script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and castinga must must watch movie for everyone
__label__0 this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get s lost in central park really it s not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back 
__label__0 a lot of death happens in the wild you don t need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary what is with this fascination with gruesome death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a family friendly nature film and why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film s trailers were the filmmakers afraid of losing money then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birds of paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible it was surreal it s as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of first and second graders on a school field trip wow from the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat if there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on animals actually copulating giving birth laying eggs bathing sleeping cleaning each other socializing playing emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual behaviors like mouth brooding migration problem solving skills culture yes many animal species have what humans call culture communication skills parenting healing abilities etc in other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more well rounded and focus on delight and inspiration instead 
__label__1 this is absolutely one of the best movies i ve ever seen it takes me on a a roller coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriella s sång i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy 
__label__0 lame movie completely uninteresting no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum they manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies the scene where hartnett grabs the family s car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty it just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruel some subplots weren t even explored they were just used as filler why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes why and on what grounds is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist for some reason even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer s house to jack up his own commission they keep coming back to him anyway they knew he lied to both of them yet there they were coming to terms that both said they would never go for stupid just stupid this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders there they were just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover amazing that they didn t hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each the scriptwriting was terrible the action sequences were boring the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett it fails miserably and ford s phone turn the damn thing off how many times could it ring in a 2 hour movie 50 60 it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie every 30 seconds that stupid tune would play and if it wasn t ford s then hartnett s was ringing it was incredibly annoying complete waste of time ford s worst movie since 6 days 7 nights which was without a doubt the lowest point of his distinguished career 
__label__1 nicolas roeg s projects are variable to say the least but are never less than interesting insignificance is obviously first and foremost an adapted stageplay it s wordy and pretty much room bound but it pays to view this film more than once the underlying themes are not overtly presented and what s more it takes a while to adjust to the juxtaposition and role reversals of the four protagonists einstein mccarthy munroe and dimaggio einstein is wracked by guilt over hiroshima yet fancies the simplicity of a sexual liaison with munro munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and craves intellectual credence senator mccarthy is at the height of his witch hunting powers but is an impotent sleazebag dimaggio is insecure about his celebrity self obsessed and prone to violence each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction each character has a troubled abused abusive past and a questionable future gradually we see that obsession itself is the central theme america s obsession with its postwar cultural icons and mores the obsessions of the protagonists for something none can have peace of mind and or happiness compared with the theory of relativity a proposed unified field theory and indeed the cosmos itself all the aspirations and interactions of roeg s protagonists seem insignificant yet these aspects of the physical universe it s all quantum trust me affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us monroe s mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb without naming it as such is not an anachronism per se but can only be understood by a contemporary audience indeed all the references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable viewer one au fait with 50s occurrences personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century this film and its screenplay are either very very clever or extremely opaque and pretentious ultimately however probably insignificant live long and prosper :)
__label__1 after having seen a lot of greek movies i feel very suspicious against most of them but after watching this i felt astonished the movies is great without a big try you cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical it s a real story and it is happening in greek rural areas in places forgotten from god the movie is like a punch in the stomach and i would really wish that things are not like this it obviously talks about the xenophobia of the greek people the ignorance to anything different the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex convicted the problem is that he is not one of these people he is different and they do not want them that s why all the good things he is doing turn boomerang to him and also speaks about the apathy of the people because there are some people who are against the hunting of the king but they do not dare to say their opinion in the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like god says but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king this shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system in the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them if you want to remain different and even alone you are lost and it is not far from reality i think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and i believe that his play was great small comment for hatzisavvas plays the policeman he is like a dinosaur he has played a lot of roles and i m sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo i definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good greek movie 
__label__1 i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible i am attempting to watch all things star trek this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved shades of grey is the first recap episode in the tng series having just watched the shows these clips were fresh in my mind but i noticed how a couple of them were re shot because the film looked better season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me and the actors looked silly like they didn t fit in their own skins the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker s life on the enterprise up until this point the data and riker scene in the holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker s authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon then the admiral kicks his a but good this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi up until this point they have mentioned the fact but they have yet to exploit it let the record show that the st wiki memory alpha claims that imzadi means first and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come here is the article http memory alpha org en wiki imzadi by this point in the series production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci fi behemoth it was destined to become watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows a ds9 movie would have been nice too 
__label__1 i must confess to not having read the original m r james story although i have read many of his other supernatural tales i ve also seen most of the previous bbc christmas ghost stories and this one in my opinion surpasses most of them only equalling the signalman i can t really fault a view from a hill the direction and mood is perfect as is the acting lighting and of course the story and writing i thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team i understand that the bbc plan to make some more not necessarily based on m r james stories so that s promising 10 10
__label__0 if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy this is going to rock your world and might i add kudos for proving that good talent good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc which prefers to air crap like jim belushi s show year after year k 911 is a big steaming brown german shepherd sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie it s exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve jim s comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee if you enjoy jim s work this movie is your reward 
__label__1 so what constitutes a real independent film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge i m sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy which is why we should be glad that films like hatred of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film love it or hate it hatred isn t afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that kallio the director didn t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place he s in this to tell stories good ones you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but don t be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel if you expect smut or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the finer points of the horror suspense genres check this film out yes bruce campbell did produce this movie and i m sure he s proud to tell anyone that it s not evil dead bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and it s obvious that he didn t get involved with hatred so that it could do so either my advice though to all dead ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr kallio and mr campbell are trying to show you the acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally it s good to see compassionate performances in a horror film so often actors in films such as these don t even seem to try with hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horror film campiness technically hatred is about as competent as indie film gets the editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and hatred keeps a quick pace without any bog down points or bad anti climaxes all in all hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi million dollar fake indies but personally i don t see a problem with that it s a film by folks who actually care about the medium people who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie check this one out 
__label__0 really really bad how does a film this bad get made i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point interesting camera work or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck except for the nudity and pancakes but it looks like genius compared to this dreck the best script doctor in the world couldn t have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo the only thing going for this film is that it ended i ve got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something ugh i m glad i only paid 5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill 
__label__1 this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and that s about it with a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like mulholland dr a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this 
__label__1 from start to finish i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie it s amazing that the groove tube is possibly the granddaddy yet raunchiest of all comedic skit movies this is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia for 73 minutes the weird strange humor never stops just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier it s way way better than comedy central or any prime time show do yourself a favor and trash all those soft lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket better yet tell your box office manager you want the groove tube back on the big screen 
__label__0 i saw this film at the rotterdam festival as did presumably all the other voters the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got it s most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite round the twist but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you re trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states as i can t think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic poorly acted albeit by an amateur cast and prey to the subaltern mentality the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in all problems can be solved by leaving the island 
__label__1 it s very very funny you know just like a comedy is supposed to be it also looks very very good like a hollywood spectacular should so what more do you want howz about a very very good sally fields she is so much better here than in anything else i ve ever seen her in and she looks so damn good this movie is all you need to understand why she s a star those eyes like a silent movie star but better in fact everyone s eyes are so good i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend we d do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner they don t do that at all in soap dish great the eyes have it sorry there s so many terrific performances its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear there s a whole workshop going on with kevin kline on how to overact very very subtly got that yeah he s damn good so is robert downey jr who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the slick slimy executive cathy moriarity while not the most gifted actress is so charismatic and riveting especially when she s angry and even whoopi goldberg is decent her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing ok no whoopi bashing i hear ya and then there s the hair soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighties so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves they get bigger and sillier just like your s did yeah we got pictures soap dish is better than i thought it d be better that i wanted it to be i m sick of movies that tell me i m supposed to care about shallow self centered semi talented egomaniacs ie tv soap actors soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at em thank you 
__label__1 i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store it was in almost mint condition and i d never heard of it before clearly nobody else had either i can t believe my luck you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message the very moral and non triumphalist stance of the mandela party undoubtedly despite its enormous length i had to watch it in two sittings it was like a book one couldn t put down perhaps the songs are not all that memorable but the spirit of the thing glows on forever i cannot understand comments that a musical clearly designed for stage is not realistic i ve seen south pacific and read the book too and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book i ll treasure this little find until it wears out one day they ll make this again on a better budget 
__label__1 especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed 1973 this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong too many people and nothing works the only people who can live in comfort are the rich it s set in new york in 2022 i think and it reminds you of your worst vision of calcutta i got to appreciate charlton heston s acting after seeing him in orson welles touch of evil he was maybe is capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi heroic people here he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt taking rare food treats from the rich and being totally corrupt actively condoning evil the movie all seems to take place at night and sweat is dripping off everyone except in one of the rare air conditioned apartments even though i hadn t seen it before i knew the famous ending which will not here be revealed but the ending is certainly foreshadowed great scenes with edward g robinson going to the council made up of elderly jews with heavy accents so it seems where the truth is revealed and then going off to the thanatopsis to check out gritty pre star wars dystopian science fiction 
__label__1 this and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera was the greatest epic to come out of hollywoods greatest year 1939 i will not not restate the obvious cary grant victor mclaglen who was a bengal lancer and douglas fairbanks jr give superb comic performances however i want to note two other less understood elements of this masterpiece the magnificent final battle sequence as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment is simply grand it never fails to enthrall me yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannelli s performance as the guru this is no fu manchu caricature but an well drawn articulate historically informed have you ever heard of changruputra maurya he defeated the armies left in india by alexander the great villain indeed one can see parallels between this mystical evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties a german not an indian gunga din anti nazi tract not quite but still a tremendous funny moving epic 
__label__0 i have been waiting for this movie a long time especially because juhi chawla is in this she s a great actress this movie contains six stories it s a new concept flew over from hollywood so it s not a new item 1 khamini priyanka chopra is a dancer she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her but then rahul salman khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriend priyanka chopra is still not a good actress when she yells i get annoyed salman khan cannot play comic roles but in his serious parts he is marvelous 2 vinay anil kapoor is married to seema juhi chawla he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman with forgetting what he really has in life his wife and kids anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors actresses they are great but this story is to thin for them 3 shiven akshaye khanna is going to get married to gia ayesha takia but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off 4 ashutosh joh abraham is married to tehzeeb vidya balan she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss now she doesn t know that she loves her husband anymore 5 raju govinda is a cab driver he meets stephani shannon esrechowitz who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman raju has to bring staphani to that man but falls in love with her i never liked govinda s movies he is very annoying not funny but in this movie i liked him very much like he has been growing up the last years 6 oh yes there is sohail khan he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati isha koppikar he want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in between sohail khan is not a handsome actor but he is funny i like his movies now here s the problem all these stories aren t interesting to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting here and there the stories touch each other but is not significant for the characters my conclusion priyanka cannot act loose that woman in the bollywood industry sohail khan should make more movies this role for him was too small salman khan cannot act comic roles but real serious movies that s written on his life as an actor this movie sucks and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor juhi chawla akshaya khanna and john abraham it s just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan and you only let him sing a lullaby 
__label__1 when my 14 year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night there s one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k 911 the third installment in the highly successful k 9 franchise starring everybody s favorite tv dad jim belushi folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that it s starting to skip no joke but of course you ll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesn t measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k 9 movies some nay sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment direct to video at that may not seem like something worth watching you d prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie i won t give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet one that will have you howling with laughter it s a shame john belushi isn t alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party don t forget the puppy chow 
__label__1 john garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability he has all the stereotypical notions about blindness and is sure he ll be a burden to everyone the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can t get through to him neither can his girl back home played by eleanor parker he s stubborn and blinded by his own fears self pity and prejudices it s a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama the best scenes are on guadalcanal where he s in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane dark glasses and holding out a tin cup all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera 
__label__1 like the jeffersons good times was one of the those classic american sitcoms which was never aired in the uk not to mention it came out in the 1970s a decade where of which i wasn t born yet but like most fans of the show i watched a few episodes on you tube and afterwards i loved it the evans family are headed by james and florida two parents trying to make ends meet and who despite their lack of qualifications encourage their children who have their own aspirations in life to fulfil them and to take their chances james was the strict but loving dad who didn t dare hesitate in disciplining j j michael and thelma should they over step the line whilst florida in contrast was a fair kind hearted and considerate mother and loving wife although she was in many ways similar to james with regards to their attitudes to parenthood and family values from an afro american perspective the kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves j j was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour who would often wear multi coloured outfits and whose dy no mite catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as arnold jackson s whatchoo talking bout willis from diff rent strokes michael was the smart alec who dreams of becoming a lawyer whilst sister thelma had her own dreams and hopes her verbal taunts with j j were mostly hilarious as was the love hate relationship between brother and sister which was played out extremely well by both mike evans and bernadette stanis over the seasons there were a few cameo appearances made most notably from janet jackson debbie allen and a young gary coleman as himself i actually prefer good times over say the cosby show which was an 80s show because a i preferred the evans family over the huxtables both in terms of a characterisation and b as i felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues in a way that resonated with many viewers it was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class afro americans in 1970s america the cosby show attempted to cater to the mainstream audience in a candy coated way as the huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated themselves into an upper class u s culture we would associate whites with whereas good times in contrast was much more edgier and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way i actually found that whilst the cosby show can be fun to watch at times it lacked that bit of sassiness which good times has and of which made it trendier and cooler the show did jump the shark during the latter seasons as it continued after john amos s character james died in a freak accident in reality it was known at the time that john had quit good times for good and so his character s death was written as it is on the show without john the show suffered and alas it lost a lot of its charm still for a sitcom good times ticked all the right boxes if only they had shown this in the uk during the 80s as it certainly is as jj would put it dy no mite my rating 8 and a half
__label__0 i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles e g good will hunting the fisher king the world according to garp these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although well acted is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to smoochy club paradise and alladin on ice every good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i don t need a feel good hollywood cheese fest but i ve got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness this movie reminds me of love liza which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares 
__label__0 imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it s raining and you re finished with the museums you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don t have to engage your brain it s sold out options the bank job in bruges the leatherheads or prom night you ve seen the bank job suprisingly decent heist movie that and in bruges again pretty good so you re down to two you don t fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the 8 50 walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for 8 50 it would be money better spent it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn t know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyone s intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen ben affleck and hayden christansan i hate his acting so much i don t care how you spell his name you are relieved on your title s so in summary not good 
__label__1 i grew up on this classic western series and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on sunday evenings to watch it bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs the series chronicles the adventures of the cartwright family who live on a ranch near virginia city nevada around the civil war era their ranch called the ponderosa is run and defended by the widowed father ben and his unmarried three sons adam hoss and little joe these three brothers have different mothers all of whom have passed away years earlier the cartwrights are a hard working prosperous and honourable family highly respected in those parts the ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding also trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth needless to say few of these excursions pass uneventfully although hospitable much of the cartwrights energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation the cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary they are involved in various town affairs even the political life of the nevada territory one of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present despite occasional disagreements between ben and his three sons and despite frequent disagreements between the three brothers now one brother might beat up another every now and then but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long the characters are all very well drawn ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity the oldest son adam the most rational and suave of the brothers left midway through the series the middle brother hoss is a gentle giant of a teddy bear who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies the youngest little joe is a hot headed handsome charmer who by contrast has quite a way with women this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible for whatever reason the actors are all stellar in their roles including pernell roberts adam dan blocker hoss michael landon little joe and of course lorne greene as the principled family patriarch ben i also love the ranch cook hop sing played by victor sen yung this is a wonderful action packed western with great values the cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous if only there were more programs like this vintage western on tv these days 
__label__1 personally i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy and brando should have won for best actor anyway the movie is awesome the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it do so and fall in love 
__label__0 cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that i ve ever seen not that they didn t try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting i m not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrong some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing i had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran there was also an insincerity about it all being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it that was bolstered by the pretty 17 year old girl who was in love with the 30 year old junkie and the frantic nature of the lead was a turn off enough there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was listless and unending with uneven time lines the characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you ve just not seen enough skip it i assumed that this was a first time director who was enamored by his own turds but he has done this before i m puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money 
__label__0 me my boyfriend and our friend watched this movie if thats what u wanna call it and we agree with the last person but we were stupid and bought the damn thing we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it we hate it really suxz so beware do not buy this thing they call a movie we would return it but don t no if anybody would want this stupid movie oh and another thing the shouldn t call it the legend of diablo they should of called it legend of azar and this movie is rated r this should not of even been not rated we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie this is a movie that would have been done by a church theses actors are never gonna become nothing because this movie 
__label__0 holy cow what a piece of sh t this movie is i didn t how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn t know either i don t remember any farting or belching in the book do you they took this all times childrens classic added some farting belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted it into a kaka joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i don t want the kids that i know to think it is don t take your kids to see don t rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie 
__label__0 the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets it s suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlito s way or at least did not care about continuity this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one of carlito s close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie they re not even mentioned luis guzman pachanga in the original is in the movie but he plays a completely different character the original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969 70 considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier wouldn t you think one of carlito s long time friends would make an appearance in the original carlito start s out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail that s only a few month s between the end of the prequel and the start of the original semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it s an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original what happen to gail it s the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release 
__label__0 it s unfortunate that you can t go any lower than one star prior to watching the wicker man i had considered aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars in all fairness the wicker man doesn t detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it there is a cheap trick all too often used in hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful it is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers even more so in that the carefully crafted or however they put it conclusion didn t seem to follow logically from the plot which naturally i can t elaborate on without introducing spoilers and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point it is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths pedophiles and possibly die hard nicholas cage fans but only to a few of the mainstream audience if you really want something along these lines i heartily recommend m night shyamalan s the village instead lacking some kind of memory erasing pill i suppose i need to watch something better to force it from my mind say attack of the killer tomatoes or pee wee s big adventure 
__label__1 vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable however i have watched this movie three times now and believe me it s an awesome movie vivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do or would do when it comes to marriage in that sense sooraj r barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well made highly entertaining movie several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride amrita rao the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family the song do anjaane ajnabi goes well with the mood of this scene the first conversation between shahid and amrita when he comes to see her i e a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation also amrita s naive nature limited eye contact shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid s questions the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle alok nath when she feeds him at shahid s party in the form of another s daughter in law rather than her uncle s beloved niece clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r barjatya film in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on screen couple without a shadow of doubt other characters alok nath excellent anupam kher brilliant mohan joshi very good on the whole vivah delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families the movie has top notch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r barjatya it s a must see 
__label__0 the proverb never judge a book by it s cover was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface as i viewed the artwork to king of the ants i instantly thought horror the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover back spoke of a dark vision the synopsis promised a story of murder betrayal retribution instead what i discovered beneath that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock king of the ants features chris l mckenna as sean crawley an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world even if it means murder except sean crawley is someone you don t care about never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character in fact he s downright unlikable but not as much as daniel baldwin ray mathews who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust esp in the homeless and little to no common sense and george wendt as duke which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean now there are a couple of interesting hallucination sequences in this film the source of the cover images but this film never delves further into that world it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters bad dialogue and unlikely event after unlikely event oh the horror 
__label__1 i have to say seventeen missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery dedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a so called graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mother s wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance seventeen missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 10 10
__label__0 as an ex teacher i must confess to cringing through many scenes though i continued to watch to the end i wonder why boredom perhaps the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish mashed and unfocussed the plot too although there were some good ideas the plight of a relief teacher for example were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3 d development not one of mr nolte s finer moments as to young mr macchio does he speak that way in every movie plot and acting complaints aside the hair styles alone were a nostalgic if nauseating trip :)
__label__1 this is my favorite classic it was filmed a little west of philadelphia pa when i was 13 in 1957 and released the next year then in 1970 i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the home of the blob the theater scene was in phoenixville near valley forge park and it is still showing films today

__label__0 the first cruel intentions the original is my favorite movie of all time it was an absolute masterpiece so how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad sarah michelle gellar was perfect in the first movie in this one amy adams sucks she is terrible and couldn t they have found a chick who actually looked like sarah michelle gellar at least the same hair color i mean come on robin dunn isn t as bad as adams but he is absolutely terrible when compared to ryan phillipe the sebastian in the first film is devious deceitful and much more evil than the sebastian in the prequel and what is up with the story line it basically goes like this 1 sebastian has a bad rep at his first school so the movie says although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life and how he has been with girls 2 sebastian moves to new york and just suddenly decides he s going to turn himself around he falls in love with danielle might i remind you that in the original sarah michelle giller says quote you broke up with the first person you ever loved because i said to so how can he have been in love in the prequel and he s all nice and charming and all good person as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing 3 he does a complete 180 and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie and then seducing cherry i mean its terrible and i loved the first one so much i haven t even seen the third one yet i hope to god its better than this prequel 
__label__1 it s amazing that so many people that i know haven t seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie i ve never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie s slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that s the only flaw i could find in this cult classic if you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated director s cut for the best viewing option rating 9
__label__0 we all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust maybe that s a bit hastey but damn if slaughter high wasn t terribly unoriginal even for a slasher flick pretty much the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former bullies who all show up to reminisce as you d expect they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april 1st by means of electrocution burning hanging and chemically altered beer i ve got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie but considering the ending i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie 
__label__1 it s a generic coming of age story think the member of the wedding summer of 42 a summer place even little women and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music not used slow motion or played down the golden lit prettiness of the setting otherwise it s done with rare emotional perfect pitch nothing s forced every line has feeling and the pacing is just right even the below a list casting helps bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material in particular witherspoon is excellent her line readings are fresh and original and her body language is just right for a gawky hoydenish 14 year old on the eve of womanhood waterston is also very fine even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck one senses that the film s makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects no big stars no big car crashes no special effects and consciously decided to make the best possible movie box office be damned it s intimate and honest and it sticks to the ribs if you find yourself misting up at the end you don t have to feel you ve been duped 
__label__0 this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver s license it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars such things as dune buggies drag racing custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull drawn out and even sexist at times none of the people in the film are actually heard instead everything is done in narration and voiceovers sorry but i can t stand that there is nothing educational or interesting about dad can i borrow the car it s just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their wonderful world of disney tv show 1 10
__label__0 i had several problems with the movie 1 the screenplay specifically kim basinger s voice over movies are not books they should show the action rather than have a voice over tell us what s happening occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script in fact it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over 2 i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex carter s acting was pretty bad that s a significant failure for me in defining jessie s and thomas characters with no connection between them it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex deprived if it had been properly done the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story 3 with the book i understood jessie s mid life crisis in the movie it seemed more like just plain boredom on the plus side i didn t think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv though that thought did occur to me 
__label__1 i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years 
__label__0 at one point violet lucy liu tells neil cillian murphy that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure she said because i m bore phobic it mean that she can t really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities well i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic because watching the detectives is a cheer boredom have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward but neil s life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store she s an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him anyway after some dates they decide to see each other the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can t really doing something normal whereas neil is completely opposite to hers the question is is they are going to be in love at the end you bet watching the detectives is a cliché romantic comedy to its core and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else from the first couple of set up we know that neil is pretty laid back guy who didn t really commit to anything and then violet enters the scene looking all weird and annoying so at this point we all know that we re going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they re going to end up in the end is it worth waiting for i would say no as i said they tried to give something more for the audience watching the detectives is trying to talk about commitment to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart or whatever well i think it is completely bullshit this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself forget about it that girl is one of a nutjob after collaborating with many great directors recently danny boyle s sunshine and 28 days later ken loach s the wind that shakes the barley and neil jordan s breakfast on pluto to name a few it s pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop paul soter by all means he s not bad as usual but such a talent actor like him shouldn t be wasting his time in the movie like this on the other hand lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet her acting is a mess i mean it s all over the place and so over the top tony montana would have been proud the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title you simply can t really connect a dot between the plot and its title and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all in short watching the detectives is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn t imagine bloodymonday rating 1 5 4
__label__1 vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie abre los ojos open your eyes and in my opinion a much more human and emotional version tom cruise plays david aames a selfish egomaniac who takes other people s emotions for granted and thinks only of himself jason lee plays brian shelby david s best and in many ways only friend penelope cruz plays sofia serrano brian s girlfriend whom accompanies him to david s birthday party cameron diaz plays julie gianni david s occasional bed buddy kurt russell plays dr curtis mccabe a psychologist interviewing david all of their interactions and the consequences of them make vanilla sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made i won t explain anymore of the plot because it s far more compelling the less you know ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow if you pay attention you won t be confused the film is very complex but not confusing and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made 
__label__0 i don t know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd orcas are most definitely not the cold blooded killer this movie makes them out to be its silly orcas are extremely intelligent don t get me wrong but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was so i was at least somewhat amused by it personally i d recommend going and seeing jaws if you re wanting to see an animal killing humans type of movie but if you re like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i d say go ahead d:D
__label__1 unlike tinseltown s version of hello dolly jay presson allen s screen adaptation of ira levin s hit broadway thriller couldn t wait for it s stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen so producers wisely decided to make the most of it s lengthy white way run the film s opening and closing scenes are shot inside new york s intimate music box theater where deathtrap played for nearly five years even the film s final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay s famous logo although marketeers decided to go with a more fun rubik s cube icon for the movie now on a low priced dvd release deathtrap seems just as fresh and inventinve as ever the cast is just right better than their stage counterparts and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for our one room two act thriller to take place in opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways director sidney lumet wisely tags any new material onto the beginning and end of the film and leaves levin s wickedly twisty center alone the film s last scene is a major hollywood departure from the boards and slightly undermines one of levin s plot points from earlier in the film helga about a dagger will be used by another woman because of play like robert altman s the player however our new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage screen and could it be real life 
__label__1 i love cartoons they can show things that films with real actors and scenery cannot though computer effects are changing that more and more they can push the boundaries of satire the simpsons good taste south park spectacle aladdin or reality toy story there are some good examples of this in ice age such as when we see a motley herd of now extinct mammals migrating across countryside chatting like old friends such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time it s a really fun film sit back enjoy the deliberate anachronisms the lovely backgrounds and the belly laughs the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth sid an idiotic sloth and diego a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe for very different reasons on the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems also popping up throughout the journey is scrat history s unluckiest rodent who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter in glaciers on top of dead trees in ice caves his opening scene is a classic it s a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the nappy changing or the dodos are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good there is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred s eyes not a must see but good for a fun hour or so 7 10
__label__0 the most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever let s forget that in order to become a saint the saint must be dead and saints don t have significant others that for a millennium nick has been the jolly elf to fred s scrooge is never even hinted at open on nick learning how to make toys then on fred learning how to run numbers nick giving a sick child a dolly fred repossessing the dolly along with the family farm after a few more such episodes morph to present day fred venting his spleen at siblings anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy there i just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy this santa who is one ho ho ho ho ho away from a massive coronary is a neurotic wuss saddled with the queen of the harpies an operation straight out of mega mall hell and answers to a board huh which just gave the easter bunny his pink egg oh and his right hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin tight mini dress and go go boots ho ho ho ho ho but what really sent me over the edge was slam being named 1 on the naughty list shouldn t a naughty list be reserved for the future hitlers and stalins children who are the true embodiments of evil nope to old sausage fingers a good boy who lashes out because he is unwanted and unloved is the demon seed the nimrods behind fred claus should be boiled in their own pudding bah 
__label__0 it s hard to believe people actually like this dreck i do think kids can enjoy it but to me it s the kind of kid film parents can t bear to sit through predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the star spangled banner i had to turn the sound off then i came here and discovered they did that because she won star search i ve always felt jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful sadly missed brother and this crap shows why zero stars 
__label__0 he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero s acting and the hole thing was i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie 
__label__1 i thought this movie was hysterical i have watched it many times and recommend it highly mel brooks was excellent the cast was fantastic i don t understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating i loved it i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor his i just can t say enough about this movie i look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also please put this movie on more often i can t see it enough leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine ever since cinderella i always thought that she wasn t really funny but loved her acting in this movie she was very funny and her and mel did a great job together they should put more of his movies on tv 
__label__0  i love new york is another entry by vh 1 mtv networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ebonics speaking craziest contestant and her mother and give them a show on this network many will argue this is a show true it s not as bad as it s previous show flavor of love but it s just as bad it reminds me of a skit from the 90 s show in living color where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on the love connection dating show and he picked robin givens for a date mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in this show reminds me of that the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto you ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv but these are professional reality actors so why bother it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network well you can t hate them for trying to make a buck maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour or wonder if she and her mother s next show would be on the wwf any way you slice it it s a train wreck you ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately 
__label__0 kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always worth watching i say nearly and almost in large part because of this movie first off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weak willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn t give up until several days later that said kevin kline s character is even more annoying and less likeable so even if you normally like these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass 
__label__1 i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie at least that s my opinion i am not sure it s a movie about drug abuse rather it s a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers drugs are side effects something marginal again it s not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that he definitely failed as most people think it s one of the many drug related movies i however think something else is the case as in many movies portraying different cultures audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture i e something they ve grown up with and are quite familiar with this movie is to show what those genius people very often think and what problems they face the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time they feel like i went to work did nothing still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects what should i do now with my free time and what s even more boring when you can start predicting behavior not because you re psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past so for them from one side it s a non challenging job which is also fairly boring sometimes and from another they start to figure out people s behavior it s a recipe for big big boredom and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic math describes logic while life is not really a logical thing is actually absolutely right :)
__label__0 tyrannosaurus azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous spanish explorer hernando cortes ian ziering has landed in mexico with six of his best men including lieutenant rios marco sanchez they intend to claim the land in the name of the spanish maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises within minutes they have their first sight of local aztec savages within minutes after that cortes his men are captured held prisoner if that wasn t bad enough it turns out that a couple of tyrannosaurus rex live there like to eat the locals in an effort to win their lives the spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas ulterior motives it s not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for directed by brian trenchard smith who coincidently made one of my all time favourite exploitations films turkey shoot 1982 which i throughly recommend to one all also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of aztec rex the title was changed by the sci fi channel when they aired it maybe as the original title tyrannosaurus azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film this is yet another idiotic cheap looking sci fi channel creature feature that s all you need to know really based on around the real spanish conquistador cortes during his expedition to mexico the film definitely doesn t strive for historic accuracy although i will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately tyrannosaurus azteca is still just a creature feature with a bunch of people running from some poor cgi computer graphic of a monster despite it s period setting not too sure what else i can say despite being set centuries ago the usual clichés are here the character s are the usual cardboard cutouts make stupid decisions the selfish one the heroic one the backstabbing one the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten the pretty woman are all here easy to spot the film is predictable silly dull doesn t really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace there s one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you the story isn t that good has plenty of holes too this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days now i have seen commented on plenty of sci fi channel creature features usually the cgi computer effects are terrible while tyrannosaurus azteca doesn t exactly buck the trend i will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards there s a few decent gore effects here too there s a cut out heart a guy s leg is bitten off there s some blood splatter a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur there s a few dead bodies seen someone is stabbed with a spear the t rex gets to eat a couple of people too the production values are really cheap the aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from styrofoam those spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist they could have simply stepped out of it run away it was so low with a supposed budget of about 900 000 i can t see where the money went shot in o ahu in hawaii in apparently fifteen days the acting isn t great from no one i have ever heard of tyrannosaurus azteca really isn t any better than any other cheap sci fi channel creature feature despite an almost interesting unusual premise that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not at a guess probably not

__label__1 the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african american entertainers of the 30s than any denigration of the entire race stepin fetchit caricature notwithstanding besides who i just mentioned there s also frog or fish versions of cab calloway fats waller joesphine baker bill bojangles robinson and louis armstrong this happy harmonies cartoon from hugh harmon and rudolf ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be if not they re certainly very flattering impersonations even the lazy shiftless fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as hold that tiger plays on the score highly recommended for fans of 30s animation and jazz music 
__label__0 scary movie 3 2003 was a bad idea to begin with the last film was a mediocre effort put it next to this load it s a comedy classic whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots at least it was funny there s nothing funny about forced humor jokes pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool the humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who ll laugh at anything when they catered to the junior high school crowd any sense of self respect was tossed out the window ring parodies are not funny i have watched them in comedies since 1998 they re so dated michael jackson jokes are not cool either what s even worse is making fun of two broken down has been performers whose best days were never the death of american cinema has been a slow one films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it s coffin whatever happened to real humor i haven t laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time too many bad movies rot the brain you want proof go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what s on the shelves this movie is bad don t believe the hype i would rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again definitely not recommended unless you have a handful of brain cells 
__label__1 it isn t always easy to explain what a movie is like but this time i think i ve found it it reminded me of two movies trainspotting small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland and the blair witch project because of the style of filming it s about the loyalty between two friends one of them is coming out of jail the other one hasn t been caught yet with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol as they try to find some fuel they find a farm in the middle of nowhere the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them than it all goes wrong one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer s daughter and they have to run what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland the two friends literally have to run for their lives apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time ok that s not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place the scottish countryside but i still find that quite amazing especially because this isn t actually a bad movie it s perhaps not the greatest movie ever but they still can be proud of what they achieved i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie i give it a 7 10

__label__0 this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing pratt falls 75 of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didn t think i d ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film there are at least 3 others that suck more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasn t dead inside even bogdanovich s kids are awful the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible there s a reason bogdanovich couldn t get another project until 4 years later please don t watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it you re better off finding another soulmate i d rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity
__label__0 i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren i m a person who they call a cultural barbarian i hate art in any kind of shape or form rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague no one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind let me give you a résumé in a few sentences it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker the housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist she falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay despite of this they make love with each other at the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is deported by agents the end you want an even shorter résumé boring that short enough the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity on a side note my sister loved this movie like i said i m a cultural barbarian 
__label__1 i ll be honest with you i liked this movie it s a great zombie flick that is packed with action original ideas good acting but is also packed with bad zombie effects part iv entitled after death is also good i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere 10 out of 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive slumber party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other recommendations check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section 
__label__1 this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanza s voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did 
__label__1  the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom jerry s cartoon it features the usual cat mouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse him as much as it is weird it s also very cool and funny to see what we can t see jerry invisible it s amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who s doing it we know who right it s like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts it s equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he s invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when he s not visible some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry s shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks tom s chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too 
__label__1 it s a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us i found it through a rare video dealer and it was certainly worth it this is without a doubt the best film made during the pre code era and the finest film of the 1930s masterful director frank borzage made wonderful films about the depression and with man s castle he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them and they help make this movie a wonderful romance young s trina is sweet and hopeful while tracy s bill is gruff and closed off the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult but in the end rewarding relationships on film man s castle is the most soft focus pre code film i ve seen borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter s village where bill and trina live into a palace the hardships of the depression are never ignored in fact they re integral to the film but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh it makes the film warm and affectionate man s castle is the crowning achievement of the pre code era if only more people could see it 
__label__1 a remarkable piece of documentary giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself for further evidence check out some of the comments on imdb compares extremely favourably with oliver stone s comandante which is mainly an in depth examination of fidel castro s nostril hairs i don t know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being or yet another in the long line of populist latin american caudillos nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans it s hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions but i ve certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what s at stake and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup someone says in the film we re making history and that s exactly what the film feels like it s capturing outstanding stuff 
__label__1 i gather at least a few people watched it on sept 2 on tcm if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the u s it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the u s was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible i watched because i had just seen a documentary on bad women actresses in the u s pre movie censorship board set up in the early 30s it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than hedy s most sensational shots in ecstasy in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this by today s standards and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty it was a nice lyrical movie to relax to i loved it for what it was a simple romance i watched it after pre recording it during a sleepless early a m i would love to see the first version released in the u s for comparison s sake 
__label__1 the books of james michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s his tales of the south pacific became a major blockbuster broadway hit for rodgers hammerstein south pacific was directed by joshua logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another michener success sayonara it was only a decade before that american films during world war ii did not portray the japanese kindly i m sure it wasn t easy for people who fought the pacific war to change attitudes overnight that and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance sayonara is a relevant film today the military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally in america at the time sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states today gays in the military is a big issue someone may one day do a sayonara like film on that issue joshua logan was on familiar ground south pacific also had racism as a component of its plot with a sure hand logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story marlon brando patricia owens james garner kent smith some of the occidental players do a fine job but the picture is stolen by the orientals here miko taka hits the mark beautifully as brando s love interest but the real stars are the two that one both supporting players oscars red buttons and miyoshi umeki buttons is your everyman enlisted man air force member he falls passionately in love with katsumi played by miyoshi umeki they marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up they presume to know what s best for buttons and umeki buttons was a tv comedian and a fair talent but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career and miyoshi umeki s oscar was the first one given to an oriental it got a great deal of attention because at the time of the academy awards miyoshi was starring on broadway in flower drum song i was privileged to see it on broadway it was the first broadway show i ever saw i still carry the memory of it that oscar symbolized something else too our war with japan was really over and we saw in sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture ricardo montalban plays nakamura a kabuki theatre actor if sayonara were done today logan would never get away with it but montalban is fine good location photography and a grand story this film should be revived more often it has a great moral 
__label__1 what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a sci fi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a sci fi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodes his performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story which i think was even more his goal seeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend 
__label__1 writer director brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called somewhat unfairly hitchcock imitations contrary to popular belief de palma doesn t rip off hitchcock he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent modern way like hitchcock de palma is known for mixing blood soaked death with macabre humor dressed to kill made way back in 1980 is perhaps de palma s most well known hitchcockian film and it s probably his best as well the story involves a cross dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt out housewife played by angie dickinson and a street wise hooker played by nancy allen yes it will remind you distinctly of psycho but de palma s flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative the museum sequence is particularly well scored and edited the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film dressed to kill may not be a complete original but i d say it s definitely worth your time rated r 105 minutes 9 out of 10 
__label__1 i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story the acting by nolte lee arkin and the supporting cast was superb the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details 
__label__1 how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was and still is the best document of texas life for the time period consider the following men beat their wives get drunk at bars nightly get married to settle a fight commit adultery and compete on mechanical bulls try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly they dont make them anymore it seems current films are always about people with lots of money they live in huge homes drive expensive cars and don t work this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete s sake anyway i watch it at least once a week no kidding i have dissected this movie from end to end feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary consider the following scenes bud sees sissy they are split up he amicably honks and waves she flips him the bird he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off buds mom calls him approx 18 hours after he gets into town on a sunday to see if he has a job yet all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid x2 with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him you all live like pigs think about why this scene is needed think about it was it necessary could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink god i love that sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull only a few days or possibly the next day after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband steve asks hey sissy remember wes oh yeah didnt you beat my husband up the other night so let s get this lesson goin to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one bud and sissy s many fights which by the way all take place in public in gilley s the wedding reception picture taking session oh the humanity could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way my legs are sweatin momma in conclusion you don t put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology it is a documentary of real life i only wish there was a director s cut 
__label__1 i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal documentary of not this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes i kept focusing on how these women who are clinically way beyond eccentric reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue blood universe perhaps some abuse or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its own this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation without going completely over the edge as the edies do their thing i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble strewn bedroom cats urinating on the bed racoons emerging from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad like a child s birthday party gone seriously wrong very definitely worth seeing and seeking out you ll never forget it but very disturbing 
__label__0 i have seen most if not all of the laurel hardy classic films i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel hardy however fails miserably for various reasons one of which is how out of place their cloths are still early 20th century however are both portrayed in the 90 s setting some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever the real laurel hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation 
__label__0 this kind of inspirational saccharine is enough to make you sick it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess you d need such prompting to feel if you re stupid enough to watch a film as simple minded and sappy as this streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it s just that a display switched on and off like a light because i can t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film even though it s based on a true story and an inspirational one at that i m sure the set up execution and performances play like a third rate tv movie or half witted high school drama 
__label__1 maléfique is a very interesting movie it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures the central concept is great three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth who the audience identify with and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell the atmosphere is well woven it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes in the château d if prior to becoming the count of monte cristo the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell particularly the character we are meant to identify with carrère a white collar criminal whose crime is not specified but it s obliquely suggested might be fraud on one occasion carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell the claustrophobia is unbroken there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall so even though the film appears to be very modern it has a very old world feel of incarceration the characters are intriguing we have marcus a violent pre op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pâquerette french for daisy a heavily retarded young man pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and unfortunately this included his baby sister hence his current predicament i like this comment on internalisation very primitive lasalle is a withdrawn possessed elderly man in for brutally murdering his wife the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you and there s a ritual that goes with that i think that s what disturbs me the most seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically it has a real life ring to it the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong i m actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self destructive i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don t really reinforce the message consistently particularly with carrère also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film not in terms of a successive revelation either i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish more by design than execution such as the famous vagina eye and the sodomy of lasalle for me totally hollow images at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with and some things don t seem logical for example we ve been clumsily led to believe different things about carrère s child this doesn t change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird a pure horror movie there is no comedic dross or genre segueing like cube 1997 natali the obvious movie to compare it to it s a total immersion experience where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters this last comment i make about it being a pure experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge this prompts lasalle to go insane that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge it s something i myself have felt one final comment is that two of the quite well received comments on the board have confused the characters names to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character simply click on philippe laudenbach s page and you will see he was born in 1936 
__label__1 what a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe i don t know how come the rating of the movie is 7 3 it should be 9 3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect you should watch this movie once i think twice well it s up to u anyways i love this movie and it s not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya the only thing i don t like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if a r rahman would be the music director but anyways we can t do anything about that so ya 
__label__0 ah yes the 1980s a time of reaganomics and sly chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies at the time i couldn t believe how movies like rambo missing in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office they re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly troma s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place of course not troma s war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that there s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is 
__label__1 if you love the thin man series you will love this movie powell s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles there are even dogs the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy but it isn t half bad 
__label__0 this film is horrible bad acting bad writing bad music it s just horrible not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role playing games but the key elements of the film are poorly executed may the god i don t believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination 
__label__0 this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel spin off of the original series compared to the live action series this show is utter crap the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it thats basiclly the idea every episode the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god which is quite right since he s her mind control slave but this stupid spin off is not worth the time or the effort 
__label__0 one would think that a film about a young person s coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring think again this production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it s about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market it s almost as if the film maker considered making a movie but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random and randomly boring images and go nowhere scenes throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting pretend that good lighting ins t important in the film making process and wrap it up under the auspices of an arthouse film this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film makers to poo poo the indie film movement and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films if you re interested in films covering this subject matter you d be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logo s website or renting get real better yet read stone butch blues whatever you do skip this long winded piece of dreck 
__label__1 ok so the oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year and i was rooting for gosford park to win come on robert altman had deserved an oscar for years that said i guess that it was high time for an african american to win best actress contrary to the previous reviewer halle berry s role in monster s ball was far more original than nicole kidman s in moulin rouge i never would have thought to nominate the latter for anything especially in a year that saw mulholland dr among the things that i had predicted was the stuff about the september 11 attacks i knew that they were going to say something about freedom yeah yeah robert redford should know better but contrary again to the previous reviewer whoopi goldberg is not the worst host among the past hosts was bob hope for whom i have no respect i really liked her jab at john ashcroft so although i wouldn t have given a beautiful mind best picture the 74th annual academy awards still pleased me i have to admit i enjoy the oscars more than my own birthday and the day after as my parents and i were hiking around the dwellings in bandalier new mexico it was spring break i was thinking to myself that when jim broadbent won his oscar that most people watching were asking jim who i wonder whether or not woody allen will ever attend the oscars again 
__label__1 funny sexy hot there is no real plot but you needn t anyone so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college cliques need no development all in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others last thing i ve got to say unbelievable funny you ve got to see it and if you are young and you want know more about the female body you ve got to see it twice
__label__1 i may be getting ahead of myself here but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time i watched it piece by piece on tcm last night the question arises to me why did they do that putting their lives in jeopardy many of them died on the trek why would they undertake such a life endangering journey just to find food for their animals once they reached the land of milk and honey why didn t they just stay there would you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle as dangerous as it was to do it for that purpose alone shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people risk death for a cow better them than i 
__label__0 i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru not one laugh in it ok maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big black bald gay virgin but the rest of it was shockingly un funny on top of being void of any laughs the skits go on forever steer clear of this one if you value your time and money dreadful the worst 
__label__0 in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe i can t see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who s afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn t always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens 
__label__1 i was very impressed with this small independently made picture the story about a pair of social outcasts who meet become friends and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children is at times hilarious at times sad but always provocative music mostly by underground bands was used to great effect as was the experimentation with camera angles filters and slow or fast motion techniques the performances the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film are some of the best i ve seen in the last couple of years if you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot i really believe you ll appreciate by hook or by crook 
__label__1 i m giving it only 9 out of 10 because i need to view it again in a more current mind frame to have a fresh perspective what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when i watched it i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day probably 1990 or so i might have even recorded it but that recording is long gone i m sure i wrote to greencine to try and get this title in they currently don t carry it i hope i can find it at a local video store i would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere it s interesting at the very least if you enjoyed movies such as edward scissorhands beetlejuice gummo or anything sort of strange and along those lines try this one out 
__label__1 kurt russell is strong and mostly silent in this futuristic action thriller from paul anderson event horizon resident evil set on a garbage dump planet soldier plays like a cross between rambo and shane with russell barely speaking as the title character an obsolete genetic soldier left for dead the supporting cast of colonists including connie nielsen sean pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute michael chiklis is able they spend most of the movie being scared of russell and the rest of it running for their lives russell s performance here is one of the best he s ever given with almost no words to say he conveys emotion feeling and meaning with looks and glances it is almost a mime performance when the action sequences kick into gear he kicks ass and does so in a strong silent matter of fact way there are flaws jason scott lee is brutish as a superior genetic soldier jason isaacs does a great impression of frank burns from m a s h as a weaselly commanding officer and gary busey busts a gut and nearly busts his girdle as todd s mentor this is an underrated and excellent sci fi flick and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner david webb peoples wrote both screenplays 
__label__0  spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead when this show first started i found it tolerable and fun fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked it also had high ratings along with spongebob but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the show first off toilet humor isn t all that funny you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp but that s pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke next there are the kiddie jokes lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross dressing lololol i just can t stop laughing at such gay bliss somebody help me but of course this show wouldn t suck that bad if it weren t for stereotypes did you see how the team portrayed australians they saw them as nothing but kangaroo loving boomerang throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert but now is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all over used jokes the show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever cosmo is mostly the one to blame i hated how they kept on mentioning super toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and cosmo would freak out and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e mail episode you know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid s room yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s to others if i m not mistaken i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show thank god everyone around my area says it s like the funniest nickelodeon show ever i just can t agree with it i think it s just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse 
__label__0 you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad plus every time i see mercedes mcnab the sister i keep thinking watch out she s a vamp for those that know buffy angel a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i don t know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn t make back any money i d say it s good for little kids in it s simplicity but i don t know if i d want to subject a kid to it umm 1 10 because that s the lowest it will go 
__label__1 i do miss the company vestron they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s this is very apparent with the astonishing paperhouse a film that touches me deeply each and every time i watch it the idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings thusly the dream world manipulating reality and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she s never actually met is fascinating and never disappoints charlotte burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing she becomes very self aware and strong towards the end even finding she doesn t hate boys as she so defiantly claimed at first through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones all visually stunning with a grand score from hans zimmer i m quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on cd when it was released in the united states on rca victor at the time of this writing there is no dvd of paperhouse yet available in the u s only in europe here s hoping one of my wishes will come true as i truly cherish this beautiful film and a dvd of it would be very welcome it s satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend marc elliot spiers both charlotte burke and elliot spiers do a magnificent job throughout i find the editorial comment on amazon com about it being hammy acting quite perplexing i found every aspect of paperhouse to be exhilarating even in minor scenes of brilliance like when charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door it s quite powerful you don t have to be an arthouse type to enjoy paperhouse just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more there is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and i m still in awe of the cinematography and sets for me it s never like watching the same film twice as there are so many details to absorb and savor a very emotional experience indeed while there are many films i adore there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me films like paperhouse static resurrection and donnie darko when i see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins all i have to do is watch paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed 
__label__0 as a veteran of many many pretentious french films i thought i d taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything but not this pointless relentless violent unpleasant meaningless the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art avoid at all costs 
__label__0 this movie is a 90 minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom what kind of high school is this anyway unless you are a major ramones fan do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish this movie should be called ramone fever everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick as far as teen comedies go you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one 
__label__0 the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael played impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all it s a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future 
__label__1 well this is an ivan reitman film with the rare exception ivan likes to entertain his films generally aren t deep but they are often entertaining enough my super ex girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so grand and i love her portrayals i like luke wilson too and rainn wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isn t very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before it s a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a headache and don t want to strain your brain it s escapist fun and there s nothing wrong with that when you strip away the super girl stuff you re left with a story about relationships and relationships gone bad it s a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love not all of them take being dumped as well as they could a slice of life with a twist 
__label__1 i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment there s tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn t watch sepet and or gubra for 76 times i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future and i absolutely love the voice overs its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsin s voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the tree it captured malaysian s attitude and in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isn t sorted out all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it it kept me glued to the screen i couldn t even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha 
__label__1 don t read anything about this movie especially nothing that could contain any spoilers just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it and you ll have a really great experience if you like to see an intelligent twisted story go get the dvd and you ll truly not be disappointed cypher is not really a sci fi movie more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business it s about corporate secrets how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness cypher is much deeper more complex and what belongs the story and the ending also much much more satisfying than vincenzo natali s other movies cube and nothing actually it s one of the best movies i ve ever seen and that s something i really don t say this about every fifth well made flick sorry can t tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience just give it a chance ;)
__label__1 dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i ve ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren t writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever 
__label__0 this is the biggest insult to tmnt ever fortunantely officially venus does not exist in canon tmnt there will never be a female turtle this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own once gone no more the biggest mistake was crossing over power rangers to tmnt with a horrible episode the turtle s voices were wrong and they all acted out of character they could have done such a better job better designs and animatronics and no venus don t bother with this people it s cringe worthy material the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking they totally disrespected shredder the main baddie some dragonlord dude was corny the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies what s with the thing around raph s thigh the silly looking sculpted plastrons if they looked normal acted in character and got rid of venus got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds and better writing it could have been good 
__label__1 pleasant diverting and charming the best part is the swing numbers especially the rendition of my buddy partial though it may have been the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film 
__label__1 this is one of jackies best films that is him without opera buddies sammo hung and yuen biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy
__label__1 a great gangster film sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father son camaraderie brilliant star cast leading with tom hanks michael sullivan has done a terrific job great acting by him again he is an acting legend great acting too from paul newman jude law and daniel craig casting is just too good the plot is quite good you will enjoy the movie a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930 s set in the 1930 s this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie a great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son way underrated for my liking deserved a fully deserved 10 
__label__1 i generally find loretta young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways but in this lyrical frank borzage romance and even though she s playing a low self esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy she s direct and honest and irresistible it s an odd little movie played mostly in a one room shack in a hooverville unusually up front about the depression yet romantic and idealized tracy playing a blustery hard to take regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today s standards softens his character s hard edge and almost makes him appealing there s good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell who never got as far as she should have and jo swerling s screenplay is modest and efficient but the real heroes are borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close up and young you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up she s too good for this guy but she s so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion 
__label__1 at the start this one is from england so of course i had 98 chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema i never heard of this film before from the minute i saw helena bonham carter i said to myself oh here s comes the feminine version of my left foot i was right but i was also wrong wrong because the two movies are very differents my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie not because this is funny but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality here very beautiful bonham carter did exactly the same thing but with very feminine emotions the story is well written and it s very intelligent for me miss bonham carter gives one of the greatest woman s part of the 1990 s with emily lloyd in breaking the waves gee and look at her eyes she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston louise brooks michele morgan and ava gardner she s also a true talent as seen on many other movies see this one you won t regret it and a very fine job by branagh too 
__label__1 val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific i have seen kilmer on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is superb nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed the movie deserves being watched more than once the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing 
__label__1 i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carné almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i d like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing hôtel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks 
__label__1 i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i can t recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly i d had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real thing about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 2 5 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully i might say lovingly made movie and i m really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself if there is a person on the planet who doesn t know ernesto che guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s che s image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers che s image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helps movies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics but i don t think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this two parter is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind the first movie the agentine shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren t the second film guerilla picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film benicio del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to play personally i felt that the argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more entertaining in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat in much the same way that the recent valkyrie while being a good movie was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che guerilla we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises the movie does not romanticise him too much he kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children but overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didn t you think the end was like butch cassidy 
__label__0 i thought this film would be a lot better then it was it sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener and the start of it reminded me of pleasantvil but this film came up short the plot is just to ridiculous the kgb and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies how to act like americans but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated so they grab two yanks from the us to spice things up i don t know but this seems just to out there it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent someone screwed up in the casting job also for a comedy this is painfully dry there is one two funny spots tops and they are nothing to sing and dance about the film in the end will likely put you to sleep and as a twisted punch in the face this film is so pro the us it makes me sick the movie keeps on saying again and again the us is god and russia is the devil this is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the japanese in world war 2 it s films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself this gets a 4 out of 10 and i m being kind it should really get a one but the dance scene was funny but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny 
__label__1 coming of age movies are quite usual these days for 1980 foxes really gives its meaning jodie foster plays her character straight out ever since she did taxi driver four years earlier she has a stronger character in this movie she s jeanie a high schooler who has plenty of guts and seems to get out of any situation she s in scott baio plays brad way before chachi on happy days he s deemed immature by the other girls cherie currie is annie hangs with the wrong crowd chased by her policeman father jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident and one gets married to a much older man growing up isn t easy sometimes we got to explore life how it is in reality you got to be careful about the people surrounding you for me i was my own person and i tend to stay that way great music great plot this movie s a gem 4 out of 5 stars 
__label__1 the trailer for this movie didn t do the movie justice and while the movie didn t know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be this movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be kidman being one of my favorites of course i m biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better three out of four stars 9 5 02 
__label__0 the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was ham fisted and cliché ridden i cant blame the actors but surely someone must have said are you joking i cant say this this episode had a press perspective and police perspective while the police perspective was standard enough the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable i notice that this was an hbo co production if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light i was completely cringing during the press conference scene it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true 40 minutes into the first episode and i am still waiting for the suspense skip five daysthis the 2008 9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top this story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable for a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour i then began looking for journalists called scoop and for perry white to make an appearance i saw the 2009 hunter before five days made it to australia not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to bonneville and mcteer going around again head shakingly awful 
__label__1 other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film that s simply not true and a little unfair the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity i don t think there s anything wrong with the tarantino esquire way of interlocking stories together perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try i thought it made the film much more interesting perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening but that s about the only fault i can find nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone 
__label__0  except for jon heder this guy tanked the entire movie the plot sounded entertaining a 29 year old slacker son heder still lives with widowed mom keaton who happens to meet a new love daniels slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship he also meets a girl faris i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach heders performance is annoying which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you re upset about the end in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me 
__label__0 we faw down aspect ratio 1 33 1sound format silent black and white short film stan n ollie get mixed up with a couple of floozies kay deslys and vera white after setting out to visit a theatre which burns down in their absence needless to say their tyrannical wives vivien oakland and bess flowers are not amused leo mccarey s ok comedy laid the narrative framework for william seiter s masterpiece sons of the desert 1934 with l h playing brow beaten victims of circumstance forced to tell a monstrous lie which backfires in spectacular fashion much of it is very funny especially the scene in which stan is teased by deslys leading to a violent game of push and shove however some of the fun is undercut by oakland and flowers playing their roles completely straight which adds an element of unpleasantness to the henpecked husband scenario originally released in the uk as we slip up 
__label__0 it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldn t recommend this movie 
__label__0 this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer s part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn t do anything for me i still don t really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person s life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i can t recommend this movie to anyone 
__label__0 i don t really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film it s an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level it s completely amateur constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clichéd the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i don t want to be too harsh i ve made my share of student films and they were all awful but there s no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it safe assumption that much like the cast positive comments are filmmakers friends and family 
__label__1 young beautiful eva hedy lamarr marries an older man zvonimir rogoz unfortunately he can t satisfy her sexually and ignores her frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce then one day she s skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods her horse gallops off with her clothes and she runs after it she meets young and very handsome adam aribert mog they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants ending spoiler naturally since this was made in 1933 she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale end of ending spoiler this horrified people in 1933 but it s pretty tame by today s standards lamarr s nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude it s either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such there s only a few minor shots of her breasts also when she has sex with mog nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release now today they re back in this film would get by with a pg 13 easily now shock episodes aside this is just ok it is beautifully filmed and there s next to no dialogue except for the music score this could be a silent picture luckily all the actors are good lamarr and mog especially and they re so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i ve ever seen in a movie the scenes with the sexual symbolism there s quite a few of them are unfortunately pretty obvious today i actually started to giggle during one so great direction beautiful imagery attractive actors good acting all around but i wasn t exactly bowled over by it i found the movie slow moving beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me somewhat dull obvious static and had a negative ending i can live with the ending but it doesn t excuse the other problems i had with it also the final sequence is really strange and out of place so i admire this film more than anything else it was well done and i d recommend it but with caution many people seem to love this movie so i m in the minority use your own judgment 
__label__1 this is a sleeper it defines nicholas cage the plot is intricate and totally absorbing the ending will blow you away see it whenever you have the opportunity 
__label__0  women they re all scrubbers no not a good translation not at all this lags behind the previous year s dad s army entirely missing the special small screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen you could just about say that this film well represents a britain entering decline and more precisely even than that a british film industry entering decline and that is hardly a recommendation is it to be an exemplar of saddening folly all that remains after the subtlety of the tv original has been surgically stripped away by cliff owen galton and simpson are endless dilapidated musical cues yawn from the ron grainer theme bolstered sentimentality that shoddy thick eared ending how much bolder does the second steptoe film seem in comparison an increased seediness with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely fully applicable to something like the misbegotten monstrosity yours truly on this site from 1973 the mutations there is a strangely botched cut adrift tone about the scene where harold is beaten up in a rugby club that i partly hate and recoil it so far as a friend intimated from the mood of the tv series but this at least seems an original slant and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the britain of 1972 there is however an implied prostitute aye of a heart of gold who turns loose woman traitor pon poor auld arold and beyond caricature writing of the class element not to mention surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads brambell and corbett collude with the script and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham what would anthony aloysius hancock have made of it all i will merely concede that a few moments just about work chiefly those where g s play things a little more carefully and b c touch tenderer nerves and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair but and oh how this pains me to say it it is tiresome boring both wilfully detached from reality and what made the tv series great and also fully in tune with the lazy tawdry misogynist fuck it that ll do actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film making in the britain of the time 
__label__0 woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better but it would be hard he has had of course some films that aren t quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda not quite so tired and so unfunny his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen is it still our good old woody the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy than we begin to see the two points of view both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex husband in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together or make you laugh more than once or twice there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can t fit it together on there own they cam t stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year 
__label__0 it s interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film but the problem is that it s not very good there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn t bother for any of them rather bland and sometimes downright bad photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can t expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it it s unfair to review the film and compare it to other high budget films but alas that is what one must do on its own it s not very good and compared to others it s still not very good but it is not without its good points i liked the plot it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end sometimes in the really dark scenes it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well however in the end the film fails to impress the characters are pretty much non existent and we don t care for any of them any of them might die but it s possible to pinpoint the final survivor from very early on 
__label__1 if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and 3 d computer animation hasn t worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero s journey 8 of 10 
__label__1 watching david bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba susan hayward raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance look for the silent screen star francis x bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer hooray for the old testament and hollywood 
__label__0 i really didn t like this movie because it didn t really bring across the messages and ideas l engle brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it i m afraid i can t say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l engle this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating don t see this movie if you are a big fan of l engle s texts because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie 
__label__0 this is yet another depressing and boring film about aids and tragedy it begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie i kept waiting for it to pick up but unfortunately it never did the acting is fair but the script needs a lot of work and if you re looking for the nudity don t waste your time with these not so hot actors due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions i missed 1 8 of the movie if you have never seen over five gay films or have recently come to terms with being gay you may find this film interesting otherwise it s your run of the mill low budget movie it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen 
__label__1 the farrelly brothers bobby and peter are at it again with fever pitch the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby s film to the screen something that it would have been hard to do the novel of the same title dealt with a man s obsession with soccer since it is set in england where that sport consumes most of british sports fans it s to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans when they make their hero a boston red sox fan fever pitch is a film that presents an obsessive fan ben wrightly whose life revolves into the red sox season and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks a young woman who is going places but at thirty has no life of her own the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox at home games in fenway park this team s fans are probably the most loyal people in the world having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but until 2004 never won a world series in fact the ending from what we heard had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film ms barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera jimmy fallon a popular television comedian turned movie actor has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in taxi in our humble opinion the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale

__label__0 generally i don t like films directed by sydney pollack the firm being somewhat of an exception and i ve never been a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn t seem to make any sense the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway i d much rather watch any of hitchcock s films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more 
__label__1 in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies this movie does contradict the first i won t deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didn t even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began this was my favorite movie at age 3 6 and it did not scare me or confuse me at all 
__label__1 the movie looked like a walk through for immoral study most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about now who drew this penis sounded a bit gratuitous dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful albeit visually this movie got its moments i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while

__label__0 when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach still unfortunately despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays lesbians it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with however this does not mean that the film is directly bad as it s rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy ending nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages one can t help but roll eyes towards the resolution personally i was close to shouting finish already at the screen there were some decent acting in the film and the two young female central characters had some good moments so did their parents and other bi characters however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism he didn t even appear very likable but rather self involved despite his good deeds which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained i give the film a 4 as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from the script and cast had many good believable characters giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others had the let downs not been this disappointing i d easily give the film a 7 or 8 if you enjoyed this film i d recommend the film east is east which i think is an as good if not better rendering of cultural conflict as well as being amusing and engaging

__label__1 one of john ford s best films the informer doesn t feature any grand scenery of the american west instead the intense drama ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of british character actor victor mclaglen s face the former prizefighter who once faced joe louis in the ring delivers an academy award winning portrayal of disgraced ira soldier gypo nolan on the worst night of his life the plot is gracefully simple in 1922 dublin a starving and humiliated man who s been thrown out of the ira for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant for 20 he betrays a friend to the tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial self pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions it is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple gypo that is the film s most impressive achievement in most movies a burly lout of gypo s type would be cast as the heavy he d have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown in the informer gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience because liam o flaherty s novel had previously been filmed in 1929 rko gave ford a very modest budget the director and his associates particularly cinematographer joseph h august turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself in addition to mclaglen s oscar the informer also won john ford his first along with wins for best screenplay and best score 
__label__0 when sam peckinpah s superlative the wild bunch 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so with a talented if whisky marinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah s epic and soldier blue definitely falls into that category soldier blew er blue tells the story of foul mouthed new yorker cresta lee candice bergen a blonde proto hippie chick who s been rescued from two years of captivity among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she ll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money also on board the wagon she s traveling in is a shipment of government gold cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills accompanied by honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman calling gant by the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent outstripping gant in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements a band of hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played by donald pleasance here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and that s saying something and in the tradition of many previous western set romantic comedies each other during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably and predictably attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on while gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn t filled with rattlesnakes mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there i go thinking in nyc real estate terms again realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won t spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby to be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what s coming what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets unarmed people are beheaded a nice effect i have to admit women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes then raped and mutilated in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs no joke this scene would instantly garner an nc 17 rating if released today to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted i m all in favor of westerns that don t shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it s a heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well duh then it s a light hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally hilarious pair of buck toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub plot that goes nowhere all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film s promotion and poster imagery but by trying to be all things to all audiences soldier blue ends up as an incoherent preachy mulligan stew of presumably well intentioned political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre wouldn t it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history if you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity

__label__1 what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was he could take a light script and with the right casting and editing put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end you really want to know how things are going to work out the script is perfect for cybill shepherd who at the time needed to capitalize on her moonlighting success for the new generation who was fortunately for her probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start in this film she s every bit back in form as a still pining widow living vicariously through her daughter mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with fried green tomatoes two years later she may have looked too young for the role but that works well for the way the story unfolds this is her film but she doesn t overstep her bounds as a lead shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point and there s ample support from ryan o neal in his best role in years and christopher macdonald masterson s natural charm pretty much coasts on its own either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word ardolino makes good use of his cast s sex appeal the same way he did with dirty dancing but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room use your best judgment they re your parents after all i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well again credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze where are they now ardolino s next film would be the phoned in sequel to three men and a baby but his final theatrical release sister act would finally give him the nine figure grossing smash hit he deserved mr ardolino your cinematic touch is missed

__label__1  jake speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message it has its flaws of course at times it s a little slow it introduces its villain too far into the story it s action is paced at the rate of a snail s heartbeat it has a z grade cast although i ve always admired the work of karen kopins who has the straight laced good looks of sandra bullock but with all this going against it jake speed really is inspiring thanks to a charming script by wayne crawford who plays the title role and andrew lane why do i find it so inspiring because it says to me hey why not try to be a good person the story is essentially a stranger in a strange land premise that is good and heroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people jake is more than a boy scout he s more than a knight in shining armor jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty mean and evil world it s because of this that jake speed really needed to be a hit it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the world imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people i m not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex but that it would be nice if more movies such as jake speed would get a chance due south a tv show about a canadian mountie is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainment sure jake speed has violence blood and guns but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person you ll beat the forces of evil every time 10 14 99
__label__1 i haven t seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a life changing event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days

__label__1 lars von triers europa is an extremely good film how s that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever

__label__1 i remember this game it was always sitting on the shelves alone until one day i decided to try something new for a change and got this game i stared in awe at it since it was the first ever game for the ps1 that i owned that had 4 discs when i played it i couldn t put the controller down seriously the storyline of this game is so good and twisted it s almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline and that is hard to accomplish when you play the game you get so involved with the characters it s unbelievable that it s only a ps1 game as it feels like a movie and i believe it should be made into a movie too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves with a 50 off sign sitting on it trying to sell well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good heck that is how i got into final fantasy vii looking in a catalog and finding it but this is different than final fantasy legend of dragoon is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games surprisingly i wouldn t be surprised if it was made by square enix but it s not hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series or the dragon quest series but this one is but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised which it should be graphics are pretty good for a ps1 game but what can you expect from it it s ps1 man made in 1999 story i have already mentioned is amazing almost beats vii characters are a amazing you get involved so much with them and their actions a definite 10 out of 10 definitely deserved more praise and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix 
__label__0 the invisible maniac starts as a young kevin dornwinkle kris russell is caught by his strict mother marilyn adams watching a girl tracy walker strip through his telescope cut to twenty years later kevin dornwinkle noel peters is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a mollecular reconstruction serum however during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails they all laugh at him dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes jump forward two weeks later a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress mrs cello stephanie blake as stella blalack says that she has hired a replacement yes you ve guessed it it s dornwinkle the student don t take to him treat him like dirt however dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges his desire for revenge co written directed by adam rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym rif coogan i wouldn t want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either the invisible maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff the script by rifkin sorry coogan tony markes is awful it tries to be a teenage sex comedy horror hybrid that just fails in every department for a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes a few boob shots not much else i m afraid the birds in the invisible maniac aren t even that good looking the comedy is lame every joke misses by the proverbial mile this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having henry jason logan a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny the invisible maniac makes the police academy 1984 1994 series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication as for the horror aspect that too is lame it s also an incredibly slow it takes over half an hour before dornwinkles even becomes invisible dull predictable boring has highly annoying unlikable teenage character s director rifkin or coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try make the invisible maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience there s no scares tension or atmosphere as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through he does nothing with the invisibility angle just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets there is very little gore or violence a bit of splashing blood a few strangulations the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun unfortunately he was invisible at the time we only get to see the headless torso afterwards the budget must have been low i mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet when he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him the entire school has about a dozen pupils two teachers the invisible maniac is a poorly made film throughout it s 85 minute duration i spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion lets just say the acting is of a low standard leave it at that the invisible maniac is crap plain simple i found no redeeming features in it at all there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish definitely one to avoid

__label__1 so what s the reason is there some sort of vendetta against this awesome show or somebody involved therein why would the best show i ve seen in years be canceled i m addicted i saw this show on randomly last fall and immediately loved it and watched it every week then it went away and i tried to tivo it but it wasn t being aired so i forgot about it for awhile until i found the episodes on abc s website now i want more i agree with everybody else with the rest of the junk on tv today it was refreshing to see something as well rounded and developed as this i watch boston legal for my eccentric comedic fix and house for my intellectual mystery jackass fix my wife loves grey s anatomy for its realism and i do love hate the show but it could not be farther from real for me way too much drama everything that can go wrong does but for once there s a drama that s really real real people real problems sure there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good girl running from the mob etc but these people especially in nyc are really out there and i relate to each and every one of them i can t seem to get enough i just hope that abc will get their heads out of their bean counting butts and continue this show get some respect for having a quality drama out there this could be one of the best shows of all time if somebody will just let it 
__label__1 i read a few reviews of this tv movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment i agree that perhaps the film goes on a bit too long 2h30 would have been enough but i certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter jim jones expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner the movie takes its time in showing how jones recruited followers brenda vaccaro s and brad dourif s character are stand outs in that matter but also in observing an uncanny shift in jones perception of reality it is mind boggling to see an egalitarian left wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator perhaps the movie doesn t explore jones motivations enough which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times may have to do with censorship as well but powers boothe s mesmerizing performance makes it all come true i am not familiar with the details of the real jim jones life but boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real the movie features many strong scenes among them the preaching messes of jones jones s meeting with father divine a remarquable james earl jones congressman leo ryan ned beatty s visit to the guyana camp and of course the suicide scene it is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and boothe is quite commanding in those last moments madge sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower and so do veronica cartwright as jones wife and brad dourif especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion the relative calm of the end of this scene the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one s mind a disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses worth watching if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century not to let it be repeated again like ironically the inscription in jim jones camp those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it 
__label__1 this is a great movie i did the play a while ago it had an extra zing to it i loved vanessa williams as rosey and also jason alexander has a good voice it was great the setting were also very good except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes makes it pretty long overall i give it 8 5 stars they also added a few parts but it was still cool 
__label__1 this was a pretty good film i m not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment but i didn t want to take a chance anyway near the end of the film the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory i can t remember the first passage he reads but the second one is genesis 9 6 he says it s genesis 9 12 but he actually quotes verse 6 this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment it s too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today did anybody ever hear of john jay the first supreme court justice in the history of this country he said that the bible is the best of all books too bad we ve lost that view in america 
__label__0 there are movies that are awful and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long forgotten and unwatchable also lots of violence and bad stuff not just cheesy stuff you know what i mean add to the mix as well what is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content why final justice of course remember mitchell joe don baker was the star of that movie and that was riffed by joel and the bots on mystery science theater 3000 now this time with mike taking joel s place on the satellite of love but with the same bots that trio got to make fun of mst3k s second joe don baker movie final justice of course much of the naughty stuff that i mentioned was removed for television release but still i want to watch that episode and mitchell as well because what does joe don hate the most why none other than mystery science theater 3000 p s if you have a big lots nearby check that store for the uncut tape lol that happened to another user 
__label__1 the haunted world of edward d wood jr isn t a particularly good documentary aesthetically it s lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in cohesive but this adds to it s charm i say this because it s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such there s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall it s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but don t expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after wood s own heart 
__label__0 what in god s name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies was zombie 90 ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here zombie 90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas who specializes in earth shattering gore films such as goblet of gore and anthropophagus 2000 and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isn t much different than the rest although the level of ineptness well earth shattering zombie 90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson s dead alive is gory think about it getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a z grade nightmare i can t tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longer i ve seen only one film that was worse than this the chooper for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme pestilence a try but you ve been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all you re here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride schnaas 1 10 updated 7 5 09 after a few more viewings of zombie 90 i ve had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie 90 is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star 
__label__1 if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don t bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it s even up to you and your beliefs as to what s happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romero s tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out 
__label__0 it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone brian depalma al pacino and even michelle pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage it is nice to see people so rich and successful wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of film making of all time this movie represents the worst of hollywood what is this is it based on a true story well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today but then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a cuban refugee going to make it in the american drug subculture kind of like rocky on cocaine is it a movie about cuba or cubans for the life of me i don t believe there is a single cuban in this movie the accents are totally fake and scene with antonio s mother looks like a poster for midwest american values the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show is this movie about miami it looks more like l a transposed in florida afterall a palm tree is a palm tree is this a romance novel the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other is this a drug movie well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water admittedly the acting is terrible let s get to the rest the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence welk show i think i heard a polka the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective clearly the photography budget was excessive the sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse the writing is appalling this is one of those movies were the script writes itself you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks so i am going to ask is this even a movie it could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours but at least a drama series has some kind of focus maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap 
__label__0 this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue in cheek à la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up brain dead teenagers and asked them to ad lib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoul busting broad on the motorcycle 
__label__1 one of the best films i have seen in the past five years the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being superstars in the making funny charming sad and inspiring this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry clark s often nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing so don t miss it 
__label__0 i can t figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad it s like the tv station are desperate for anything anything at all they re buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant where does all this fake light come from that and all that stupid bickering between the characters they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive it tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping but because it s such bad directing and acting you will not your florence nightingale fix with this flick sorry i m joining the negative feedback and i concur that this is one of the worst movies ever 
__label__1 japanese tomo akiyama s keko mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequels but i haven t seen them since these films are hyper rare some kind of re releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizard whatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed well the main thing about the film is its name keko mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background the most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say keko mask unknown while the actor names are listed the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies she has a gorgeous but lethal vagina yes you read right she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like i ve never seen such a beautiful vagina and now i can die in peace this film is totally fantastic there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films japanese censors optically fog blur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc there s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl s bare you know what for the first time and says hey there s no fog in it i couldn t help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this also one character says in the end that he will return if japan films allows to make the sequel i m glad it allowed as i ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous one sequel should include blues brothers yes those blues brothers in it etc this is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find this would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don t mention here and it wouldn t be even necessary to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek i think you ll love this little gem as i do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 8 10 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal 
__label__1 i m not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti grudge people are talking about here perhaps it s just that some people like to rant about things the movie was certainly imperfect uneven acting some may have had difficulties with the time changes actors all too willing to go places i d really rather not go etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections first and foremost i loved the breaking of the rules bit normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone giving you time to regroup get friends and find the token mysterious paranormal type normally semi spoiler alert when you re hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you ve found out they re just misunderstood or they ve been freed or whatever secondly the production was exceptional while the movie was hardly special effects laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against em they ve got their place but great for those who ve begun to take the conventions for granted and who don t have trouble with the time distortions 
__label__1 i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell played by p j soles is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuff it was fun energetic quirky and cool yes i ll admit that the ending is way way over the top and far fetched but it doesn t matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie it s sex pot and rock n rocll foreveri read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not

__label__1 with the advent of the imdb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience why because users here who do a search on two time academy award winner glenda jackson can find the return of the soldier among her credits so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie fans of ann margret can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb given all the cross referencing that goes on here so why isn t this movie out on dvd don t the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film and the return of the soldier is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered get with it people 
__label__1 i don t know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i m a fan of urban horror there s not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf just the title alone peaked my curiosity so i decided to check it out and i was surprised it s not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story is it low budget yes can you tell that it s low budget yes but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn t matter i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice i don t know what s up with all these bad reviews for this film all i hear is worst movie ever have these idiots seen every movie out there there s thousands of movies out there how can you categorize one as the worst ever a video not movie like zombiez may be the worst film i ever seen but i can t say that it s the worst movie ever since i haven t seen every movie out there bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs listen if you don t like minority based urban films the ghetto films hip hop etc then why watch these types of movies knowing that you don t like this type of stuff sure this is a horror film but it s not just a horror film but it s an urban horror film with a multi cultural based cast i don t like tv shows like dawson s creek or the o c they suck to me films like garden state wedding crashers and i heart huckabees suck to me i m a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me why because i can t relate to them they don t peak my interest just common sense believe me i will never watch garden state 2 garden salad wedding crashers 2 here s a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring now back to this movie in regards to saint405 s comment above i don t know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked stupid by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me everyone did a great job the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good job i m an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it s not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off anywho i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i ll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this bring on the sequel i m out jerzee representin 
__label__1 directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi battlefield baseball and jun ichi yamamoto meatball machine is apparently a remake of yamamoto s 1999 movie with the same name i doubt i ll ever get a chance to see the original so i ll just stick commenting on this one first of what is meatball machine a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore it s not something you ll end up writing books about but it s nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema meatball machine follows the well known plot boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date boy finally meets girl girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg boy in turn does also transform into said thing and goes on a quest to save his love will he succeed who gives a damn as long as there is carnage and death i m satisfied the plot is simple relatively clichéd but it does it s job well enough setting the movie s course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives and yes it too luckily shows more violence i m happy acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film it s not exactly painful for the ears but it s not exactly good either the movie s main attraction besides the violence and gore like i haven t mentioned that enough already are the cyborg designs done by keita amemiya who s work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video games is well known the necroborgs as they are called in meatball machine look stunningly detailed without the usage of cgi amemiya s designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal painfully awesome in their appearance able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws rocket launchers blood firing shotguns and so on and so on though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film necroborgs are a movie class meatball machine is tetsuo the iron man mixed up with alien all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode it s an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking 
__label__0 1st watched 5 26 2002 4 out of 10 dir michael almereyda weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter s body at least i think that was the relationship a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king s the shining the difference is that there was campiness in nicholson s performance that isn t at all in this film this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one liners and attempts at litening up the mood don t work at all the performances are not the problem here but the story is everything doesn t seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which of course gives him top billing in an attempt to sell the film don t buy into this gimmick and avoid this film 
__label__1 there are so many hollywood movies made now that are not only torture to watch but also have no bearing on anyone s life whatsoever granted movies don t always have to have deep meaning but it s nice to know that there are still film makers out there who care about telling human stories i won t give away the premise of this brilliant film however the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones i have ever seen in my life and i m a 32 year old film buff too bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites which includes on the waterfront sunset boulevard and black narcissus to name just a few this moving movie should become one of your favorites also that is if you have a heart 
__label__1 this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september 11th attacks this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u s soil the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks and some of the pieces are actually funny but not abusively so this film came highly recommended to me and i pass on the same feeling 
__label__1 i love this film it s one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesn t try too hard to be star studded the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completely the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes no that s not a spoiler

__label__1 ah noir my favourite genre otto preminger s follow up to laura is a film noir set in a postwar new york where corruption and violence run rampant it stars dana andrews as sergeant mark dixon a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors when he accidentally kills a murder suspect dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss tommy scalese dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man s wife the beautiful morgan taylor of course in typical noir fashion things quickly go down hill while the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom like most great noirs it is also wonderfully paced sucking the viewer in right from the start still like most of preminger s workmanlike films it s not something i d watch again it lacks the verbal wit of wilder the visual flamboyance of hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of welles like lang s later work sidewalk feels very much a clone of what a noir should be instead of something really artistically genuine thematically the film is nothing special it s about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal in one scene dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook the film flirting with the notion of predestination but this one scene is as far as otto goes or dares to take his ideas the camera work is likewise disappointing there s no intelligence in otto s camera no effort is made to assign the camera to anything it doesn t play with space or architecture or empahsise the step by step police procedural it s just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out meaningless though most people don t care about these things there is however one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters noir cage which itself enters a vehicle lift another cage and is taken up into the chief gangster s lair like lynch s blue velvet otto retopologizes the film constantly likens upstairs to hell this works well but the set design fails to reinforce it 7 10 otto seems content to follow the hawksian mould of what a noir is rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go like detour night in the city scarlet street in a lonely place act of violence bomberang and johnny eager where the sidewalk ends is one of those well made second tier film noirs it s competent and engaging but lacks that extra special magic 
__label__0 unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes for a short film the cinematography costumes sets sound editing and everything else is very very good this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals so the quality is to be expected the problem as usual resides in the story itself thing is it s not really a story to tell a story or in cinema s case show a story you need plot and conflict you need things that happen to the protagonist events these events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he can t get it tim watcher has no problems or goals he s a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind that s it so what we have here is pure exposition instead of being shown a story we re simply learning things about this tim watcher individual of course considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film s short duration it s hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice over narration in this case it s used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we d never glean in fact if it wasn t for the vo we d think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things to make it worse the vo also explains what s happening on the screen the images we re shown are just decoration for the text we re listening to i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something but because the images don t stand on their own it s impossible to say that what s left obviously has value as a measure of the crew s technical capabilities not incredible but good but fails to entertain amuse thrill or at the very least show a story 
__label__1 i strongly disagree with ctomvelu regarding jim belushi s talent i happen to like belushi very much admittedly i was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because i was such a huge fan of his late brother john but jim has an on screen charm that has gotten him very far and he has developed it well over the years curly sue is one of his earlier films his weight is a giveaway ain t that true for most of us and i like the film yes it is touching and heartwarming so if you re into car chases explosions and gratuitous sex then you might want to pass on this one it is a warm film of three lost soles who find each other don t get me wrong i am all for the three aforementioned keys to a successful film but i also like a nice solid tale like this one and although belushi and kelly lynch deliver excellent performances the real star of this film is alisan porter who is absolutely adorable i don t know what happened to her career but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball agent parents herself should be shot you couldn t ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film and yet nothing of note has been heard from her since another sad hollywood story 
__label__1 putting the ufo thing aside this was the best documentary i ve seen factual reporting by neil and buzz a must see the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006 no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes the facts will blow you away and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero s of our time ever see a man save his own life bet not neil saves his life when only mili seconds separated him from death amazing to watch it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death from a failing computer 10 stars 
__label__0 i was really disappointed in this movie those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose the acting was ok kinda wooden and cardboard the ending was sorry i just didn t care for this at all no way could i recommend this mess 
__label__1 i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of mary kate s and ashley s characters sam and emma stanton they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but unfortunately it s just not that easy for them to actually do i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i m sure that you ll agree with me here if you haven t seen this movie yet then i say you really missed out big time and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now this movie is a real winner sincerely rick morris
__label__1 but this is a great martial arts film liu chia liang ranks second to none as a fight choreographer only sammo hung at his best compares this is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique rather than flashy camera angles etc during fights the direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed this film benefits also from liu s participation in front of the camera liu s performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history liu is supported by the beautiful and talented hui ying hung of my young auntie fame and hsiao hou whose acrobatics are breathtaking and preferable to any amount of wirework as for the plot this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge but with character and moral development along the way and a most fitting resolution the humour in this is also of the best if you only watch one kung fu film ever this would be a good choice it has it all 
__label__0 ziab la ta kol al lahem is an awful movie this is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link acting is also very bad despite the presence of a good actor like ezzat el allayli but something is really astonishing in this movie talking about sexuality emancipation of women nude scenes are very rare in arab cinema even in this days i really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies but with better quality the reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting but also the lack of prfessionalism this movie look like an amateur one we can see a lot of errors in the screen if you want a good arab movie ziab la ta kol al lahm is not the one recommended but if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same 
__label__1 i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and innovative this is a 10 in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not they took some risks and did a few things different i think it worked well i am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone else s interpretation 
__label__1 a must see i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious we re talking nonstop laughs it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty brains and serious acting ability peter cohen the director has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men s egos in the urban dating world for all of it s comedy whipped succeeds with it s intelligence which is so rare for a first time director especially with a romantic comedy he is a major talent judah domke brian van holt jonathan abrahams and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady s men you ve got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet s web check out the trailer on whipped com it s worth the 3 minute download 
__label__0 this movie was banned in england why tom savini george romero dario argento lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80 s horror film good looking girls who can t act to save their lives by the way a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour a scythe a crazy brother wandering around the family estate and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end but banned seriously when the english parliament banned this movie the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore which was greatly underdone there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made obviously but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with as it stands the film is entertaining but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result banned what a joke 
__label__1  where the sidewalk ends 1950 opens appropriately with dana andrews and gene tierneys names inscribed on the sidewalk as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate the sidewalk represents respectability integrity and morality only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter but even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion and when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one s shoes wet mark dixon dana andrews was born in the gutter his father a professional criminal and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb as a police detective dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked but he possesses a mean streak that he can t escape when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised a cheap criminal who ll cheat and lie to cover up his offence where the sidewalk ends was the only film to reunite dana andrews gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb laura 1944 though the two films as far as noir goes couldn t be further apart whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country house murder tale this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama given her ravishingly memorable performance as laura hunt it s unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused occupying the typical niche of the pretty helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in jules dassin s the night and the city 1950 andrews on the other hand has rarely been better exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that i hadn t expected of him gary merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss scalise but he doesn t seem mean enough for the role and i think that an actor like richard conte who played mr brown in the big combo 1955 would have better suited the character i hadn t realised this but conte appeared just one year earlier in preminger s whirlpool 1949 the tension as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime is absolutely riveting certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era though i feel that the situation still wasn t exploited to its full potential the taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified dixon as the perpetrator but preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs had the witness been brought in as dixon was re enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance we could have had some genuine fireworks and why for that matter couldn t the taxi driver s testimony have immediately absolved jiggs taylor tom tully from suspicion of murder niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben hecht who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard hitting cops and wise cracking felons andrews seething and implosive law enforcer tormented by rage and remorse has rarely been done better at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas ray s on dangerous ground 1952 
__label__0 waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap 02 out of 10 
__label__0 a cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films the trail leads the mother all over europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep this is one of the countless soft core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill personally i d rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we re seeing this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of s m to the proceedings the violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement its all so incredibly fake worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting basically par for the course for many of these films you ll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur but there was nothing the most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a buick i watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller avoid 
__label__1 this is how i feel about the show i started watching the show in reruns in 2001 i enjoy the show but it had too many faults i hate the michelle joey characters stealing story lines from old tv shows they even stole from the partirdge family then in 1 episode the partridge family was mentioned actors playing different roles in different episodes mtv martha quinn the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in 1 episode the michelle character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out revenge to her sisters for a joke by them on her story lines that came went in 1 episode joey getting the tv show with frankie annette never heard from it again after that danny all of a sudden playing the guitar 1 episode he is coaching soccer 1 episode he is coaching softball baseball 1 game you are out huh danny jesse joey keep getting jobs really quickly with no experience only in a tv show i did like the d j stephanie characters wish jodie sweetin could have learned from candace cameron bure had a clean non drug adult life 
__label__1 of those comments here before mine i mostly agree with edyarb s the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny but though managing at some points in other places it failed you could see them wanting to make a joke but no one in the audience laughed also agree with edyarb s view on the end credits leave it normal or make it cool but not what they ve done now ok that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie i enjoyed it it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn t feel like a waste of money to get the ticket the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature like luke wilson s character matt asking the super chick p nis or bed when she told him she d get him a new one after a wild night in bed ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore i cannot however agree with bgs1614 who says that the film could earn an r rating there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that some sexual acts yes but nothing explicit only humorous and no nudity whatsoever maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more i d like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever superman returns and click i didn t really expect anything from either one i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic which i wouldn t oppose film superman surprised me with actually having me feel good goosebumps about seeing his first heroic deed like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it but for the rest of the story i d rather watch my super ex girlfriend at least it offers some surprises click again was a total surprise much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie the jokes also work much better than in ex girlfriend both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones anyway the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i ve seen within a very short period and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all i d rank them click girlfriend superman 
__label__0 let s cut to the chase this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the american pie teat period the whole plot and that shouldn t imply that there s a whole lot to go around serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes if you re a tween guy and you re too squeamish to purchase actual pornography then this is the movie for you otherwise the movie doesn t have much to offer at all the acting is sub par the character development is virtually non existent and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity binge drinking and pranks none of which are particularly memorable go buy real porn if that s what you want to see and if not go watch a good movie animal house kids or even the original american pie are all great cinematic works and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity it s not how much it s how you use it 
__label__0 this movie is god awful not one quality to this movie you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i ve ever seen this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies please avoid this movie at all costs it is unwatchable and pointless you ve been warned i ve got nothing else to say about this stupid movie 
__label__0 i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so long and unfortunately it wasn t worth it even for a die hard lynch fan i found this to be really tedious nothing happens there are long long long painful pauses where nothing happens long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing or caring what the hell it was all about what happened before and what happened afterward there was a mulholland drive allusion the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita esque and a lost highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly unfortunately it s all very uninteresting and very dull nothing happens it s very forgettable and i think i will delete it from my computer and forget i ever watched it sorry david

__label__1 if saura hadn t done anything like this before iberia would be a milestone now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding 1981 carmen 1983 el amore brujo 1986 sevillanas 1992 salomé 2002 and tango 1998 i would choose saura s 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which iberia pales iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albéniz 1860 1909 and in particular his iberia suite for piano isaac albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture its re formatting for a non spanish audience he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and d indy he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravel s bolero but moving in that direction naturally the spanish have repossessed albéniz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispano arabic and jewish cultures iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar the very concept is more diluted saura s flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro another of the spanish filmmaker s important collaborators the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh or somebody just unexpectedly says something in flamenco more than any of saura s other musical films it s the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé s that is the story and creates the magic because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story iberia is in a similar style to some of saura s purest musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albeniz s music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing in flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements there is only one flamenco song in iberia if you love saura s flamenco you ll want to see iberia but you ll be a bit disappointed the style is there some of the great voices and dancing and music are there but iberia s source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience 
__label__1 i ll be quick to address the matters of the film here it was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all consuming passions a young italian woman who cannot emotionally connect with her jailed political radical fiancé due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life finds solace and passion in a new young lover whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship with the anxieties rage tenderness and passions that swirl around in the atmosphere of the story equal the dispassionate quiet that seems to engulf the two leads it lends the film an unsettling mood that permeates through all the political strife that is otherwise lost on the viewer unless you have a deep knowledge of italian politics during the 80 s i found the film compelling what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead it isn t simulated and leaves little to the imagination there are other scenes of sex in the film which i do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in but the oral sex scene i feel derails the focus on the actual story it was smooth sailing up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears which caused much hoopla back in its day it s like hitting a roadblock it s jarring and unnecessary and i am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it and what s unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film which i believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface emotions and further turmoils layered in the subtext overall wonderful film hampered by a much not needed sex scene 
__label__0 i wasn t really hoping for much when i went to see this after mst3king the heck out of jasonx with some friends though i was hoping for a similar experience here unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously do i care about jason s problems i m sorry no there are a legion ft13th movies that cover that anyway at at then end of the day he s an undead serial killer i m just not going to get that sympathetic freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch only not funny 
__label__1 i know that this is an unpopular position concerning zabriskie point but i loved this film i know i know i can legitimately be called an antonioni fanatic i love l avventura i love la notte i love l eclisse i love red desert i love blowup and i love professione reporter aka the passenger the only antonioni film that i don t love the only one i ve ever given less than an 8 10 and one of only three that i have given less than a 10 10 la notte and l eclisse being the other two though i fully acknowledge that i have to see both of them again is beyond the clouds which can fairly be called an awful film however there is not better awful film if you catch my drift so if you re not an antonioni fan you should only logically ignore me if you are even a casual fan though and you are wondering whether this particular film whose name when spoken is often followed bya spit which is generally despised by even antonioni s admirers is at all worth seeing the answer is yes okay the reason that people tend to hate it is because 99 of film watchers care only for the narrative of a film well that s not exactly true if a film is amazing in a particular aspect say acting or cinematography or direction and just decent in its narrative film watchers might very well love it but a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece and have a lame or illogical story that s another thing that has ruined the cinema over the years logic then they absolutely hate the film i will actually agree with that in some ways as much as i may dislike it and want to change my view it really is difficult to love a film whose narrative i perceive as poor however other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative this is certainly what must drive viewers away from zabriskie point i could relate the story to you but you probably would just think it was nonsensical it is actually but to me that just made the whole endeavor more fantastic and beautiful i d actually compare it favorably to 2001 which is my favorite film however 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this film what zabriskie point has in spades is mood the music helps a lot the score includes a lot of acts of the day including pink floyd the mood is kind of similar to the moods of antonioni s other masterpieces filled with loneliness and desolation also the freedom that comes from that the best sequence in the film is when the lead man and woman her name is daria i know but i don t remember his name pull over in their vehicle next to a historic marker on a desert highway there is beyond the stone wall that has been erected to keep cars from flying off an ancient lakebed it s basically a rocky desert and the two go to play in it the setting is enormously beautiful the woman says this is such a beautiful place what do you think the man i think it s dead there s no inclination to whether that s a good thing or a bad thing this is a lot like sentiments expressed in other antonioni films characters are constantly wanting to disappear or become invisible instead of david locke the protagonist of the passenger fed up with journalism we have the young hippie sick of his friends politics he thinks they talk too much and don t act out what they feel is right or at least he says he does it seems to me more like he just wanted out of the situation the film is also simply amazing visually antonioni s films are all identifiable by just a few frames but his visual style was always building i like the passenger more than i do zabriskie point but zabriskie point might be his ultimate accomplishment in that aspect well that might sound odd l avventura and red desert are amazing pictorially i think it s the camera movements that are particularly amazing here he obviously made a ton of money on blowup which was the biggest arthouse hit of its day the biggest ever at that point he spends it well here especially with his aerial shots one of the film s greatest sequences involves the man who has stolen a man s private airplane dive bombing daria in her car the one thing that can be fairly criticized is the film s politics they re certainly facile not that hippies were facile but that antonioni s vision of hippies there weren t any in italy of course are bizarre and well filtered through a foreigner s eyes there s a rather childish criticism of advertising but it s a criticism that still exists today i say can t you people just ignore it what does it hurt are you walking around buying things you don t want because of billboards or there is also the criticism against capitalism daria a secretary works for a company that is stealing the land in the desert the land that she and the man enjoyed to themselves in order to make cheap suburban homes for families rod taylor a very underrated actor whose most famous roles were in the time machine and the birds plays her boss the ending which i won t ruin you ve got to see it is almost offensively cheap i can though understand the treatment of police officers not that i disdain them generally but they were awful at the time they can still be awful now they ve always had too much power these trite arguments against the american way of life still don t effect my opinion of the film much i find this filtered view of america extremely interesting i really don t think a hippie would have disagreed with antonioni 10 10 
__label__1 recap the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother in law to be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him unfortunately its a waitress from the bar and not his fiancée and suddenly she turns up everywhere the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent in laws dinner and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed it is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival comments actually much better than expected not the sweet romantic comedy i expected but something much funnier something with a little edge this movie wasn t afraid to take the jokes a little further and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half panicked and deep in trouble as he is here and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex so more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good i enjoyed it very much 7 10
__label__1 this two parter was excellent the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films but what tv shows don t do that these days what we got here was a cracking good sci fi story a great big really scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the ood the best new aliens the revived series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters complete with a couple of unnamed expendable security people in true star trek fashion some large scale philosophical themes love loyalty faith etc and some top drawer special effects i loved every minute of this 
__label__1 of all the movies of the seventies none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel i mean yes there were movies like the exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is a story worth getting into then there are all the stars and soon to be stars my absolute favorites were eli wallach sylvia miles and burgess meredith then there are the subtle clues that lead to what s going on too pay close attention i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like black and white cat black and white cake plus the books are really good as well i m just sorry that they re not going to turn the second book into a film it s so scary that it would outdo this movie 
__label__0 this movie is terrible but it has some good effects 
__label__0 i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasn t even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake bite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic i m shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun it s easy to understand that soap realizes it s a piece of s it and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense it s the worst kind of lame movie it s joyless 
__label__0 what of domino did i hate over everything and i mean everything else perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face maybe it s the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they re uttered by people like kiera knightly who if you buy as a bounty hunter then you ll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012 nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility absolutely nobody at all it is a painful and misguided experience taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them the principal question is was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she s coming across as tough but really she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school attempting to impress her peers there are things you genuinely don t know how to react to whether they re supposed to be funny or not if it is supposed to be a comedy that begs the next question is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs i don t think so the film opens with the title card based on a true story sort of if that s supposed to be some sort of post modernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose then you re simply on another planet truth is in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying sort of which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer following this we learn of domino s relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the sort of cop out as in real life she was just four but if the film had gone by reality s dates then her entire drive would ve been born out of the death of her goldfish we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey rourke domino knightley herself and would be love interest choco ramírez during the scene an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son s life to be spared what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers fire off weapons at innocents we don t know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads a feeling of no why are you doing this why is this happening bad seeds are planted and wouldn t you know it they stick the film is painful to watch excruciating even as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills 90210 here is another daft post modernist slant people playing themselves and that sort of joker card being played again christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jr s natural born killers character so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and choco s gang purely for her good looks i might add it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver s registration i ds or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another the problem is as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isn t a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up if there is any feeling between choco and domino it exists on such a small tiny minimalist scale that you have to ask why it s even included so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative wise we find out the reason for the fake i ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded he must ve swam really quickly double the speed of the film s fasted edit which means something in the region of 01 of a second yeah sure the film s story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up plus there s a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film s comedy runs so dry that it has to resort to the jerry jerry chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show when did we last laugh at jerry jerry when we were say seven years old i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film s existence 
__label__1 a winters day 28th december 1986 two bored 14 year olds hire a movie hmmmm police story looks interesting who is this jackie chan never heard of him two hours later after watching the film in a daze we wanted to know more 16 years later and severely out of pocket from collecting jc movies the film still grabs me like no other ok maybe i have a soft spot for it as it was my first cannonball run doesn t count jc movie but it is an excellent movie it has all the classic jc elements action humour action heart and action some comments say it s dated it was made in 1985 of course it s dated but then so must jaws casablanca singin in the rain and the godfather without movies like police story where would hollywood action be today ps set standards many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies to really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen you miss so much of the movie otherwise yes he really does fall off the bus going round the corner if you haven t already see this movie now 
__label__1 this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story i too cannot understand why people would trash this movie if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan this movie may not suitable for u this movie presents high degree of realism the actors and actresses performance is examplary not fake just natural no special sound effects so special side effects the camera work is excellent the music is oh so good i can t wait to get the soundtrack it leaves your body numb like constant garderner the directly has raw talent certainly not a follower 
__label__0 when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film usually when you have these types of movies there s generally one sasquatch but in this one there is like what 7 or 10 of them acting was good plot was ok i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims very good camera work i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little this movie was way better than sasquatch the sci fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain abominibal was not good the one i m reviewing is ok but the movie sasquatch was not but i m not reviewing that so let me get back on track this movie is good for a rainy saterday afternoon but for any other occasions no 
__label__1 when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film and when i had i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied it was a great movie don t get me wrong but i think the great parts where already in the trailers if you catch my drift it went very fast and it rolled on so i was never bored and i enjoyed watching it the humor was absolutely great my first contact with a sloth or something like it 
__label__1 this is the first michael vartan movie i ve seen i haven t seen alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn t ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don t think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good 
__label__0 when converting a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author s intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart s children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good enriching strengthening experiences of homesteading her land the book details her life on her and her husband s adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances though they lived dozens of miles apart the film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this woman s experience as harsh unforgiving and nearly pointless perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak odious landscape devoid of friends or hope don t waste your time with this movie read the book instead 
__label__0 anurag basu who co directed the flop kucch to hai made his debut in this film the film was ahead of it s times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to hawas which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better businessthe movie starts off well malika s guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with emraan malika is too crude vulgarthe scenes between emraan and malika are well handled and the twist in the tale where ashmith confronts emraan is brilliantthe pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of emraan isn t fully convincingalso the cop track seems half bakedthe finale is too filmy toodirection by anurag basu is good music is a winner all songs were fab camera work was stunningemraan played his naughty streak very well this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb ashmith too was good in his role for once he did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half but her dial delivery was at times not up to the mark sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films raj jhutsi is okay
__label__0 chilly alienating adaptation of rebecca west s book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired now there s an original idea it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks this extremely well cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co stars jackson christie ann margret and ian holm but the burners are all on low there are a handful of good scenes particularly whenever jackson is on screen but bridges pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film s dulled out color is enervating long on the shelf this soldier is best left forgotten 1 2 from 
__label__1 ok needless to say this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience namely stoners and like minded people that being said if you are one of these aformentioned people this film is a must in fact i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong what monty python s holy grail is to geeks and nerds so is this movie to potheads i first saw this film 10 years ago or so and i still crack up every time i watch it the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle far better than latter day knockoffs like half baked attempt to there isn t a plot so to speak the film is more of a collection of various skits as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze despite this the film has an excellent sense of pace and doesn t drag at all many people cite up in smoke as c c s best work but i would have to say that next movie is superior so if you re in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs light up tune in and let your mind float away oh and free tommy chong =)
__label__1 i saw jack frost for 4 00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that s something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing i only axed you for a smoke and worlds most pi ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too jack be nimble jack be quick jack gouged eyes with candle sticks if you re looking for a for a b movie comedy horror that s full of puns then check jack frost out 10 10
__label__1 a brilliant movie about family guilt sacrifice betrayal and love macy is such a great actor it was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with campbell who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but doesn t have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for but he s such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work i highly applaud the casting of tracey ullman as the neglected wife who knew sutherland is also very good the way he moves makes his character look taller and even younger in some scenes almost everyone knew what they were doing macy s portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery 
__label__1 smallville episode justice is the best episode of smallville it s my favorite episode of smallville 
__label__1 a series of vignettes most of them spoofing television of the 1970 s but also with some digs at the government and corporate america one of the longest segments the dealers is not that funny to me and i don t know what it is parodying some of the others though are absolutely side splitting i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment most of the foul words i know are used in the movie and if you object to full frontal nudity stay away 
__label__1 wow all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy she speaks russian then i m surrendering right now in her short skirt high top boots and pronounced bust line she s a real babe even if her zombie like eye shadow sort of comes and goes this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin ruining all the fun okay probably i should leave off my hormonal response this is a very well produced half hour by that underrated force behind the series s success buck houghton naturally the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry it s post nuclear holocaust america we know because she s part of the invading force and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage they wander among the destruction in alternating moods while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics which of course it eventually does lucky bronson and that s about it no real talk except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown nonetheless the screenplay is still entertaining and rather daring for its time even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers a popular cold war stereotype of the time in passing it s rather curious that the very slavic looking bronson buchinsky would be cast as the american and the glossy looking montgomery as the slav appearance wise it should be the reverse my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female regardless of appearances however that may be there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere still the episode remains a very very watchable 30 minutes 
__label__1  the big goodbye introduces us to the first holodeck adventure in this case captain picard posing as private investigator dixon hill this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern repeated several times on tng as well as ds 9 and voyager after entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game represented by the failure of the holodeck s safety program this concept is used to expand star trek s possibility and enabling a kind of genre mix picard s dixon hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead see for example chandler s marlowe stories or polanski s all time classic chinatown star trek never focuses on the story mostly it s a simple how do we get out of here scenario but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters those holodeck games are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound but did star trek ever had a technical scientific point to it i mean besides some utopic concepts the big goodbye shows a relaxed patrick stewart a mcfadden that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode at least the early ones and data has some great scenes too although i find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp s plug out of the wall would have really surprised him for the fact that he d done research on that period and its customs wesley continues turning peaceful trekkies into potential murderers why didn t they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off but all in all this one s fun 
__label__1 i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his her reluctant guardian i ve seen enough of them baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small town china in the 1930 s extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom he s nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though she s showed great promise as street performing heir even after he reluctantly takes her back he s not too upset when she s kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young street smart girl had to go to survive in that society the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child it s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense the peek at small town life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film 
__label__0 billy crystal co wrote co produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy drama about fathers and sons adult irresponsibility and growing old billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack ha ha which causes him to seek out his estranged father alan king a movie extra who fancies himself a big star the script is sub neil simon nonsense with one liners galore a flat inexpressive direction by henry winkler stuck in sitcom mode and family conflict at the ready crystal and king try their best but king is over eager and frequently over the top jobeth williams has another one of her thankless roles but manages to bring her innate down home class to the proverbial girlfriend character it s a comedy i guess but one that blinks back the tears shamefully from 
__label__1 i wasn t aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film i d been devastated by the movie trantula at age seven but i was ten now the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer s probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster s attacks i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor s office poor doc and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors too huge now to fit through just one it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve like diner he seemed like a sure dinner to be to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description but in the end better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick trying to act brave he knew i was in trouble and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor there the red pulsating heart like hungry dude sat waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom it took months to recover i m 57 years old now i ve made it of course the blob wasn t destroyed 
__label__0 i usually like zombie movies but this one was just plain bad the good parts girl swimming topless with thong bottoms sonya salomaa s topless and ona grauer s boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran the bad part too much video cuts too much matrix slow motion it drags the action not enough blood and guts bad acting and no story the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene a total waste of 6 and time i give it a 2 out of 10 
__label__0 this sure is one comedy i m not likely to forget for a while wouldn t normally bother to comment on this movie it s so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it s kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is so what is it then well of course it s not really a comedy instead it s intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they re especially pathetic and as for the acting well let s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one s expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned also even though i m a big fan of the horror genre i m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting but still b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances if you can find the humour in that and i could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after that then that s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer oh that and two or three pairs of breasts woohoo how exciting as for the story it s not even that it doesn t try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime the lesson watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you ll be made to pay for what you ve done i rest my case so all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock n roll i rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if i could or perhaps i wouldn t it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors names correctly in the titles i mean that s something innit 
__label__1 the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just aren t the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot 
__label__0 oh man this thing scared the heck out of me when i first watched it and i was sixteen that creepy animated barbie is scary as hell i want to stop talking about her now 
__label__1 i saw an american in paris on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since both in the cinema and on tv it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century george gershwin and features the greatest male gene kelly and female leslie caron dancers in hollywood history the supporting cast of oscar levant as quirky as ever georges guetary why didn t he make more movies and nina foch brilliant in an unsympathetic role are at the top of their form the closing ballet superbly choreographed to the title music makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post impressionist artists all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged but the most memorable are it s very clear caron and kelly on the banks of the seine and i got rhythm the kids of paris joining gene kelly in une chanson americaine if you love paris see this movie if you ve never been to paris in your life see it but see it 
__label__0 this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn t even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie jim nabors is wasted the other actors aren t given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours stroker ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it 
__label__0 i saw rachel s attic thinking that i would be in for an enjoyably visceral ride however it was not to be the case visceral yes but enjoyable that would be a big fat no in fact the only reason that i gave it a 3 is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears ever so briefly as one of the film s reprehensible characters how they ever lured mr hansen into this piece of work i ll never know the story idea is interesting but poorly executed the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that are the special effects yikes i ve seen better effects in a grade school play give it up mr w it s time for a career change i hear they re hiring at mel s diner there are very few well made inde movies coming out of michigan and rachel s attic isn t one of them 
__label__0 though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series bulldog drummond escapes this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that s less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn t have the charisma of ray milland that said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying also john barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises anyway it s another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining 
__label__1 a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after he s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he ll be transferring soon bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940 s it still remains as funny nearly 60 years later this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 my grade a 
__label__1 farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays marjorie a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would be rapist well done to farrah for being a golden globe best actress nominee when her rapist joe terrifically played by james russo comes into her home which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out marjorie has to play along with joe s frightening demands it does make for some disturbing and shocking images when her roommates come home they are astounded to say the least by marjorie s actions and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police makes the film even more nail biting i do find diana scarwid quite irritating but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed overall extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now well done to everybody involved 
__label__1 an insomniac s nightmare was an incredibly interesting well made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main character s subconscious without coddling the viewer the acting was top notch honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i shot this on my camcorder look to them but this director knows what she s doing the lighting the cinematography quality work i m looking forward to a feature length work from tess nanavati 
__label__1 at first glance this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states a race against time and plenty of secret service agents the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel but wait the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas character pete garrison instead a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981 the ss agents are specially trained to take the bullet which is what makes them special who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot all this because of his failure in a polygraph test due to his adulterous banging of the first lady kim basinger tsk there are shades of clint eastwood s in the line of fire both featured aging actors and aging veteran has been heroes with a bit of a historical reference who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty while eastwood s movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex kgb villains and the mole within the presidential detail with douglas on the run from the law he becomes similar to dr richard kimble of the fugitive hunting the proverbial one armed man while at the same time relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents which turned out to be quite interesting to watch despite slick processes it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents keifer sutherland and eva longoria top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrison s probable involvement in the assassination plot and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled x files fox mulder and dana scully but alas these two had very little to do here we know the reason why they re in the movie and that is to get their fans into the theatres also longoria s role seemed unable to shake off her sexy mama gabrielle and here has her in fairly low cut blouses sutherland actually tells her to cover up and tight pants ogle fest for fellow agents nonetheless it s still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world and the typical threats that they face daily including the following up on every nutcase s threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world it s a decent suspense and investigative thriller with enough subplots to keep you entertained but one thing though like most ending action sequences this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through 
__label__0 over the past year uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker cranking out the competent in the name of the king a lord of the rings clone and the proudly vulgar post 9 11 satire postal but then came seed and the counter was reset to zero keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach and i m a fan of the guy his films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision and are never dull spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received seed is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombie s successful reboot of halloween the antagonist is maxwell seed will sanderson a mute hulking brute who s slain 666 people and sits on death row awaiting execution after unsuccessfully frying the beast he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem trying to create a new millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression ultimately resembling a washed up pro wrestler doing the toolbox murders on a succession of equally boring victims furthermore seed s character and boll s message run contrary to one another the death penalty is wrong sure but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who s left a couple hundred corpses in his wake i think not meanwhile michael pare acts like a listless long lost brother to james remar s character on dexter a cop who sits at his desk a lot thumbing through newspaper clippings and watching pointless stop motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seed s lair by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seed s hideout the sequence is so drawn out ill conceived the lighting is almost non existent and unexciting despite a healthy dose of gore that it almost put me to sleep the shoddy film making isn t limited to just that sequence seed appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly a technique that s more stomach turning than the gore itself these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering almost non existent narrative at 90 minutes the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture which might have been boll s intent all along pure genius i guess the joke s on me 
__label__1 this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot there s not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice overs describing their experience why they participated etc it s a document it s mind blowing i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this nb the producer doesn t have the rights to distribute a dvd version i ve also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr boerner and order a copy on vhs :)
__label__0 pointless humourless drivel meant to be a comedy but not one laugh in the whole film gratuitous violence often with guns what kind of warped mentality can either make or say this is a good film 1 out of 10 
__label__1  girlfight follows a project dwelling new york high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem purpose and much more although the film is not about boxing boxing is all about the film so much so you can almost smell the sweat technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it girlfight is no chick flick and no rocky it is rather a very human drama which even viewers who don t know boxing will be able to connect with 
__label__1 wow this film had a huge impact on me it moved me it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia who is sold into the sex trade i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named holly the setting of the film is realistic the film was an eye opener i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists the content of the film was very very moving it was one of the best films that i have seen this year thegirl who plays holly does a fantastic job with her character ron livinston gives a fantastic performance the film moved me to tears it tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide everyone should go see this film i think this film will make a difference i loved it 
__label__1 the case of the scorpion s tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino who appears to be a giallo master second only to dario argento ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabulous who dunnit quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery it also makes sense in the end a big plus cause that s not always the case for these giallo s as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red herrings and ultimate solutions here the less you know about the plot the better pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography the catchy music score the gorgeous females anita strindberg is a goddess brutal murders black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few in most parts it s decently acted goerge hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well martino directs with a sure hand keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces if you re a giallo fan this is a must see if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general this comes highly recommended 
__label__1 i expected something different more passion drama again another failed attempt of originality i m sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliché of cheesiness 15 year old teens may appreciate it though the acting was not very convincing and the lines common lacking any wit still the soundtrack was good and well adapted i can t say that this movie is a total flop because people do watch it but it didn t meet the public s expectations and sunk into mediocrity so to conclude the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half which is an appreciable thing thus i guess its worth seeing if you don t get annoyed
__label__0 istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that errol flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the irs it s a remake of the fred macmurray ava gardner film singapore from a decade ago unlike that studio product istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the golden horn but errol flynn who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film was way too old to be playing these action adventure types any longer his scenes with cornell borchers really do lack conviction as for cornell she plays errol s former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia she both doesn t remember errol and is now married to torin thatcher but errol s got some nasty people led by martin benson and werner klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession got to deal with them too best reason to see istanbul is to hear nat king cole sing and play the piano most people today don t realize that cole was an accomplished jazz pianist they only think of him as a singer actually he was a pianist first the singing was an afterthought istanbul is a routine action adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie 
__label__1 director douglas sirk once said there s a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art this statement defines his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous melodramas sirk s melodramas were as the very word signifies dramas with music the music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screen turned canvas but this ain t life but its representation an imitation of life sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood most notably technicolor to distinguish the artificial from the real thing let s remember that his golden period coincides with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama blackboard jungle rebel without a cause sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else another of sirk s statements summarizes this you can t reach or touch the real you just see reflections if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen one ends up giving up therefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where there s no difference between real and its false copy nobody can say that the hadley are real people that town ain t real either with those hideous oil pumps all over the place so in this realm the acting is affected the decore is fake the trick is visible everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual connotations of dorothy malone with the oil tower for example sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time the angles are the director s thoughts the lighting is his philosophy in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows the hadleys house with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way a house that resembles a mausoleum that no party can cheer up as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night sirk s photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director s craft sirk considered himself a story bender because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose written on the wind is a good example it wouldn t work in any other hands the other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin who was for 50 s comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama their films are full of the machinery of american life advertising tv sets jukeboxes washing machines sport cars vacuum cleaners to depict its emptiness and decay i m inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences the game was played by both sides so it was camp now we regard them as cult or bizarre because we are not those spectators anymore that is why todd haynes s homage far from heaven turns into a pastiche because it reproduces sirk s work nowadays as if nothing happened in between then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly there were always immovable characters rock hudson and lauren bacall here against which he could assemble a series of split ones his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones sirk is interested in too when robert stack flies the plane and tempts lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them obvious faustian echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river in the sirk s universe the studio often imposed happy ends have no negative impact in fact they worked just great sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feud it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga i absolutely agree and i m sure the parallel is not incidental both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caan s sonny corleone the action of fighting her sister s male friend is symmetrical the non son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town even details as the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork because both films deal with the subject of power the acquisition of power its manipulation and legacy even kyle hadley s sterility the event that hastens the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power in this case a weakness in sexual power the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane one wouldn t think at first of similarities between welles and sirk s films but there are a good many starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family s fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne rock hudson as charles foster kane was adopted by a tutor having his own father alive amazingly the same actor harry shannon perform both wayne and kane s fathers this detail is cannot be a coincidence written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director some say that this is his best film in my opinion magnificent obsession all that heaven allows there s always tomorrow and imitation of life are just as good and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end 
__label__0 now isn t it considering all the good work done by danzel clive and jodie the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die hard heist movies copycat yes a couple of jokes no absolutely no unpredictable twists to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us if someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe who the hell is the rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell it could just make my day but it seems that spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy 
__label__0 a high school principal keenan wynn with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman cathy lee crosby but a catalyst for their new winning ways are you really surprised along the way a romance grows between the coach and the team s star player jack michael biehn the police are never notified packaged along with other crown international pictures as a grindhouse movie really does this film no service this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week cathy lee crosby looks great as coach randy rawlings especially in her skimpy outfits but i expected more than mere titillation from an r rated film a side plot involving a dorky center who is hypnotized by his teammates into thinking he is former nba player sydney wicks is the actual reason for the team s new success rather than cathy lee s coaching too much tease and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment 
__label__0  the cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all the plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real like lunatic could buy it don t get me wrong there s nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy award nominees and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest in a short analysis the cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really doesn t sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch 
__label__0 a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a left wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercover it s a pity there s no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalesce stories about left wing refugees in france don t have to be this dull read arthur koestler s memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death ditto to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film it s only sold in cheap low class saloons vive le tabac parisien that s what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasn t disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals the film s indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the o neill play it premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though they re running out of potentially marketable operas to revive opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer s character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidence name dropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque s earlier all quiet on the western front well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn t time to develop any drama 
__label__0 there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood cary grant was an angel in the bishop s wife 1947 of course the best were the topper movies in the late 30s early 40s and more recently warren beatty s heaven can wait 1978 which was a remake of 1941 s here comes mr jordan these were well written funny entertaining comedies all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels now comes writer director jeff lowell making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable bitchy young woman kate eva longoria parker who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist ashley lake bell who is falling for kate s fiancé henry paul rudd one thing that is clear at the outset longoria parker is no constance bennett marion kerby in the first two topper films who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured there is a line right at the beginning when henry s sister chloe lindsay sloane tells henry you don t smile that aptly described my situation throughout this film the main problem with the film is that the script just isn t very funny but it s made worse by longoria parker s presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen just to start out with compounding her lack of comedic talent she is covered with so much pancake makeup who knows what she really looks like kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue she s so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her well she actually just fades out so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is chloe wants henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after kate s death from what i saw of kate he should have felt a wonderful relief so she introduces him to ashley who really doesn t know what she s doing as a spiritualist she is also a cateress to make ends meet to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate there s a lot of meshugaas that goes on the vacuity of the film is epitomized by a b story revolving around ashley s assistant dan jason biggs this is thrown in near the end but the way ashley handles it indicates that she s as much of a boob as kate since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women he deserves whatever he gets eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin it doesn t and more s the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny as it is norman z mcleod constance bennett roland young alan mowbray and co must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two topper films has wrought

__label__0 this movie features charlie spradling dancing in a strip club beyond that it features a truly bad script with dull unrealistic dialogue that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking 
__label__1 i was able to watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it i wasn t sure if it was really a comedy or a drama it had elements of both mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful our image of 60 year old women has certainly changed since aunt bee they are vibrant beautiful sexy the only drawback in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in either the mtm or rhoda shows from the 1970 s i d have thought that since it was set in new york city where rhoda had been set that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie kavner would have appeared assuming of course she was still in the big apple it is my hope that abc will make this a series and bring back for guest appearances all the old casts of these shows by the way what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion or an eventual series wasn t that the network that carried the mtm and rhoda shows 
__label__0 townies is the laziest movie i have ever seen and i saw the blair witch movies parts one and two it seems confused in what it wants to be it s not funny enough for comedy it s not tragic enough for drama it s not bloody enough for horror and it s not good enough for watching it has scenes of a man doing slapstick bloody karate so i think oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally handicap woman and a trusting mother then it slaps itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks the part i m speaking of is a lonely townie who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling the rest was a waist of my life then just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne the director making fun of toby the star in public it made me sick even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd two other movies by wayne aren t the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits i even like killer nerd a bit it had some great lines i still use to this day if you like underground films if you like overground films and if you like to watch your feet just resting were they are you will not like townies 1 2 out of 
__label__0 i read the novel some years ago and i liked it a lot when i saw the movie i couldn t believe it they changed everything i liked about the novel even the plot i wonder what did isabel allende author say about the movie but i think it sucks 
__label__1 diane keaton has played a few heavy parts in her many years on the big screen but she s mostly known for the light and fluffy stuff with woody allen such as annie hall she deserves an oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it doesn t really matter what the competition was the year it was first shown try and find a scene in which she doesn t appear and it was all heavy drama exhausting in its pace and retakes action all at full speed the make up made her as young as possible and she fit the 30s age category even in close ups but she was playing half her age and at a very fast pace the movie overall was fairly well done staged and shot well with a strong supporting cast but keaton carried the load 
__label__1 i think it s a great movie because you get to see how diana s life at home is she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because it s alright between diana and adrian but you don t get to see how it is at home and i didn t really like it that you also don t get to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think i m going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you don t like boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it :)
__label__1 i found still crazy to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late 60s early 70s rock my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd don t worry it s only been three times and she loves it too it is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with perfection it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in love actually brought him more attention bruce robinson was incredible as brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer i live in sherman oaks california and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time we even talked of the idea of an american oriented remake before wisely dismissing that why mess with the original my only problem with still crazy is that it wasn t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience 
__label__1 finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o donnell you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is it is not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the real tale some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from 66 then is this a magnificent movie so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story 
__label__0 roman polanski has made many many movies that are unexceptional his fame bewilders me nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown i haven t seen knife in the water or tess any contribution he s made to film concluded more than twenty years ago his work is just embarrassing safe and or dull the pianist frantic oliver twist the ninth gate pirates r s baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out it s lux produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 horror movie never show the baby but this is just misconceived horror sap everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early um thanks for that finale destroying title and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days it did not sustain my interest i find that whatever this movie might have been it is utterly derailed by the 1960 s version of what femininity was farrow is such a chronic distracted helpless waif housewife her frailty is oversold she s irritating in the extreme there s no real ideas in it nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential

__label__0 a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub genre the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set pieces that we ve all seen a hundred times before has great potential as an insomnia treatment 
__label__0 plot an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra marital hijinks in a flashy car they then become stuck literally in a compromising position while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities that s it that s the entire movie there may have been some dialogue here and there but nothing comes to mind it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless but actually physically painful to watch the fact that it starred two of the uks best up and coming actors one of whom is now sadly deceased only adds to the horror ian charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar winning chariots of fire let s remember him for that role and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened 
__label__1 this is one the few movies i can watch over and over if you ve never seen it give it a shot richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly it reminds me of julia s untimely demise it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear 
__label__0 i love the 80s slasher flicks and i remember when silent night deadly night was pulled from our theaters i was very disappointed so i was very excited to see some of these on fear net you better watch out was what i ve come to expect of these types of movies the quality of the special effects were laughable by today s standards the character development too long but all in all it was laugh out loud funny the scenes where he loses it because santa aka dad is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting torches not flashlights as you would in the 80s but real torches really tickled my funny bone however the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature i also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were it took me awhile to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear on brothers 
__label__1 i loved dan in real life a wonderful journey to love story like you ve got mail or while you were sleeping but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up dan burns steven carrell is a popular advice columnist who can t seem to get things in his own life straightened out until one day on a family gathering trip he meets and instantly connects with marie the always beautiful juliette binoche a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin but marie must be off for a previous engagement and they must part ways later we are treated to dan s tight knit fun loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes what i liked so much was that although the family s characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn t venture into parody or crude exaggeration the burns family is simply a close loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren t unrealistic the family is nosey but never mean spirited or gossipy quirky but never outlandish and then dan falls in love with his brother s girlfriend he s brought to the family gathering and thus begins a roller coaster of restrained longing and funny love budding i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome it s not particularly hip or clever never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny but real dialogue in fact early in the movie the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood style conversation where the characters say what they re thinking out loud so i ve probably rambled and repeated myself but i highly recommend dan in real life it s a great date movie trust me you ll laugh and only if you re a geek like me you ll get a bit teary eyed filled with fun and magical love dan in real life won t disappoint 3 5 out of 4 stars grade a
__label__1 this movie makes a statement about joseph smith what he stood for and what the lds church believes with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the flds church and criminal fugitive warren jeffs jeffs is not associated with the lds church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about jeffs from the lds church jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all it s points about joseph also point away from the fews of the flds church and their leader at this time in the media world this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that some of the most obvious differences between jeffs and joseph is portrayed in joseph s humanity acceptance and love jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie jeffs thinks of the negro as devils joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wife s favorite horse to a african american former slave to buy his son s freedom joseph is shown doing housework for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees lastly joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all times i loved this movie and if you don t know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes then this is the movie to see and if you had confused the lds church with the flds church then you really need to get your act together we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ the sanctity of marriage and the family as well a patriotic to our homeland and country we are all different as well just like you can find different protestants presbyterians methodist baptist and catholics what s important is our message and what we stand for this movie trys to portray that but there is so much of joseph s life that can t be covered in a mere 2 hour movie this was a really great show 
__label__1 what is cry freedom like it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people main character of the story is donald woods kevin kline chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa woods writes several articles where he speaks critically about views of steve biko denzel washington soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa right from the top even from the chief of police when biko dies in police custody woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place so world can find out the truth attenborough managed to make a good movie about people with main message that black and white are the same cause we are all people story leads us to south africa and this movie is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i m disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie this is movie from which we all can learn something although it is a bit long this story couldn t be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko also relationship between woods and biko was shown great just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through but sometimes sacrifices must be made biko s death so the truth could be reveled woods book 
__label__1 this is possibly the best short crime drama i ve ever seen the acting is superb especially amanda burton who s character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some she does an amazing job balancing rachels carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who s lost a child its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv film the ending which i m not going to give away is fantastic mainly because you don t really get one you ll get what i mean after you ve seen it this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you re not touched by this you re one cold hearted person 
__label__1 if you enjoy cleese all the british pythonesque humour of the time then this little gem is absolutely hilarious arthur lowe is a real treat i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously i can t believe it is now only available in the us ntsc of course and not in uk where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour 
__label__0 this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal or as i should say steven so dull like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re dub his own lines leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped a few films before this was he has done this too but i don t think to this extent to be honest the film looks pretty good the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie of course all told this film is pretty bad it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself don t bother anything over a buck for this one is too much i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film what s taken me so long to realize this 
__label__1 pinjar is a genuinely good film with great acting good narrative good presentation touching emotions etc it seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite improving these days and this film is one evidence no bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me i was literally thinking about the movie for hours marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human the film rests on the great acting of urmilla matondkar and also some from manoj bajpai urmilla plays a girl in north india in the background of the partition and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face a must see film a technically superior bollywood product which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world 
__label__1  good times in my opinion is a must see cbs hit despite the fact that i ve never seen every episode i still enjoy it it s hard to say which one is my favorite also i really love the theme song if you ask me even though i like everyone it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tv land now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good 
__label__1 i first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the bbc when i was working on uk s 2000ad my pal steve parkhouse recorded it on vhs and sent it to me up till this point i d really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by ridley scott coming out of hong kong this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui hark pronounced apparently choy huk yet for all the smoky back lit exteriors and ambitious special effects stop motion in a hong kong movie at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and elegance of joey wong granted joey is gorgeous but it s her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that s hard to analyse and though joey is now almost 20 years older gawd which of us isn t this will always be the enduring image of that actress some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they re missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by pu songling around 1700 that s a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story just wanted to get that off my chest for me chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale it has high tragedy because we know that chio sin and sin seen can never be together it s about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we ve experienced great loss it s about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of true love and the comedy stylings of wu ma don t hurt a bit either enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a filter of western culture and you ll get on with it just fine 
__label__0 i went on a visit to one of my relatives a while back and we popped by a theatre so we d thought we d go in and give this film a go what a mistake this film is awful in every department i d never heard of the film before and literally everyone still hasn t no wonder this is as rank as it gets it s a comedy so it says well the only thing funny is the ability or lack of it of the director to make such a film getting so close to christmas this should be titled how to under cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hours or however long it was as i walked out at the end of the film you ll come out feeling as though you ve been food poisoned on a sick turkey and regret you wasted your time on such dribble who knows why such things get made some people had walked out from the theatre before the film was well over and i blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier it really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent and all that you come out and see is a poor tv movie that should be showed at 2 o clock in the morning in fact it s that bad day time tv shouldn t be showing it what else can a say probably not enough bad words could do it justice 
__label__1 this movie is a fantastic movie everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing i know mr garfield was blacklisted in the 1950 s but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd that being the case why isn t this one a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr schmid s wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it if it ever is put out hopefully it won t be colorized colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 film would go mr garfield did a superb job of portraying mr schmid some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr schmid s disability but i feel he got it just right i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two 
__label__1 this raggedy ann and andy movie is so adorable we love watching ann and andy sing and dance along with the camel with the wrinkled knees this movie is what made the camel with the wrinkled knees so popular singing his song i m nobodies i love you if you love raggedy ann and andy watch the movie and you will see why it s a movie the kids love and adults 
__label__1 i read holes in 5th grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic of course being my busy self i didn t get chance to see the movie in theaters holes was at the drive in just out of town but alas we were just too busy i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me they all said it was good but i ve read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worried suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit my sister who is 9 and i watched it and absolutely loved it i then took it to the other people i was babysitting s house and their kids 9 and 4 liked it too even my parents loved it and they re deffinately movie critics overall i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast this movie should be on your top 5 to see list

__label__1 rented the movie as a joke my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well thanks for the jeep tom whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don t mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy 
__label__1 to me the final scene in which harris responds to the press corp is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics especially the campaign phase if only the real life pols would respond in the intelligent articulate manner as did mr harris then the arrogant self serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant confrontational garbage that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he she is pursuing 
__label__1 wonderful family drama comedy starring macclaine and garr that entertains and warms the heart every time i see it strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies lovely period piece capturing 1962 the story encompasses the struggling garr her two children and aunt zena macclaine trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household the family heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left garr a run down ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late 1940 s the tenacious garr as the sweet but determined mom gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe but wait aunt zena is an old circus performer with card tricks magic powders and a jesters sense of humor she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games what happens next is a delightful combination of miracle at lords thrown together with the cuban missile crises with authentic tv news from the real event and a ghost prank that gets totally out of hand this film entertains philosophizes questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of october 1962 s cuban missile crises in the end one is left with the wonder of faith family and rediscovered love oh and the music from the era of the early 60 s is just great recommend strongly as a feel good film 10 out 10
__label__0 ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean pow camp they are tortured we learn north korean communists are bad people we learn americans beards grow very slowly during days of torture i tried to suppress it but i finally burst out laughing at this movie it was the scene when mr reagan comes out from telling the communists he wants to be on their side then he asks for a bottle of brandy next acting stone cold sober he takes a drunken companion dewey martin to get sulfur to cure mr martin s hangover of course the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come so the drunk distracts the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a drawer which is next to a bunch of empty boxes i m sure he boxes were supposed to contain something but of course reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty ya gotta laugh i think prisoner of war will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it otherwise it s wasteful prisoner of war 1954 andrew marton ronald reagan steve forrest dewey martin
__label__0 this short spoof can be found on elite s millennium edition dvd of night of the living dead good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper in execution it s a different matter this short didn t even elicit a chuckle from me i really never thought i d say this but night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part 2 in shocking 2 d was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or boring my grade f
__label__0 this is not a very good telling of the tarzan epic there was only one reason for this movie john derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff bo derek in 10 was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex this movie is nothing more than soft porn if you re into that well then fast forward to it and skip the rest this movie like bolero was again a vehicle for bo derek to show off her terrible acting she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie richard harris was a better actor than this this was one of his few mistakes don t waste your time on this movie go buy the book instead 
__label__0 i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen i am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan s face in the bar in russia it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye sockets this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film 
__label__1 a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise placed at the beginning of talkies prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full on silent film which is still is at heart and flirting with sound and sound effects the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn t help it at all hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach for example is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance other than that the movie rolls along more or less well with little jumps in continuity here and there something quite common in films from this era and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents in a way this is an experiment of a movie and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for she s a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time the last of the flapper jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now with the onset of female independence women as professionals were being represented in film that brooks s character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does reconcile with him later is also a little ahead of her time however her character s fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn t there that her boyfriend wants her to succeed and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense seen in the man who knew too much and cuts from brooks her image on screen and the murderous boyfriend even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live brooks with the now dead one a chilling effect to a chilling powerful movie 
__label__1 definitely needed a little work in season 2 such as the virus between max and logan and ames white along with his ancient super cult during season two however the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max very good drama in season two but of course like all tv shows if there s something a little wrong with it the broadcasting company takes it off the air i was seriously hoping for a third and final season season 2 leaves you hanging unless you read the books by max allan collins then you will know what happens dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again since jessica alba s carrier sky rocketed after the show if that would be the case then there should be a movie to complete it just like the show firefly which of course fox canceled as well 
__label__0 i saw this movie in new york city i was waiting for a bus the next morning so it was 2 or 3 in the morning it was raining and did not want to wait at the port authorty so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life it was so bad that i chose to stay and see the whole movie i have yet to see anything else that bad since the year was 69 so call me crazy i stayed only because i could not belive it 
__label__0 this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family it doesn t seem to know whether to be an a or a b western i mean the hero is called hopalong cassidy for god s sake william boyd must be spinning in his grave all the b western cliches are here the two gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed c mon thunder the all in black bearded villain the heroine in distress the rancher in trouble the cowardly sheriff over the top bad guys etc the acting with few exceptions is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting chris lybbert who as the hero and louis schweibert who as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30 s poverty row quickie the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen robert carradine clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one what was the point of the martin sheen robert carradine framing sequences are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost what was the purpose of the black gloves it just didn t make sense being a great lover of westerns from all genres i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic aside from the hero and main villain the other characters looked authentic if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written a grizzled foul mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled in what else can i say but on thunder on big fellow 
__label__0 lucky me i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in texas horror flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you i ve rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of worst killer clown movie ever made from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy i m sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one from all indications it was shot on dv and it doesn t really look all that bad quality wise for digital but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts the story slight and cliche as it is goes as follows an executive ken hebert who also scripted and co produced with the director takes skeptical co worker tracy amanda watson and horny married couple mark and susan hank fields and chris buck along on a weekend getaway to a yawn secluded cabin 12 miles from the nearest town on the way there they pick up a bitchy slutty hitchhiker melissa bale in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin pot smokin friends disappears one by one with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates the killer clown doesn t even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being morbidly obese it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes i cannot say enough bad things about the cast especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times doesn t really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense originality intelligence general coherence or humor i could go on for days on how inept this film is how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is but i ll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy this sucks kind of way also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s i c k serial insane clown killer it s currently catalogued under its original title of grim weekend score 1 out of 10
__label__0  spoilers spoilers when i saw a preview for this movie i thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline but as most superstation original movies i was left disapointed this gullible family ends up driving through this deserted town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them their are more gaps than i can count and they don t explain anything that happens how or what it ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something which is never explained the next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused 
__label__0 i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week and i m still working off the trauma essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising well acted too natural my problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken toothless bread chewing hags it s rather with the fact that they never warned me the festival brochure synopsis described only the utterly intriguing sounding first half hour a whore piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the never ending gum smacking to come serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews i looked at post fact um didn t at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director a bashful tousle haired russian youth who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour and many exasperated comments on exit to say the following well i um thank you very much for coming to see this film and i just wanted to say well it s a very long film it took me four years to make it and it s i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it it is very long thank you for coming this is what he said alarm bells should have been ringing what s he talking about i thought in happy confusion this is gonna be fun of course by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again and in the end i can t say i feel in any way improved by the experience yes i absolutely loved the first half hour it was intelligent new and had a lot to say and yes russia is probably in a bad state yes every society has many hidden faces yes toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard yes yes yes i get all of this really i do but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out and so painful to bear if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging try the korean chinese bin jip 3 iron it s artsy and surprising but also to the point and fun 
__label__0 for the life of me i can t figure out why anyone would make a movie like this the plot is tired the acting is strained the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the f word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so let s throw in another couple of f s for good measure that s what the american public wants to hear gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part forget this c__p rent shrek and have a good laugh 
__label__1 a compelling honest daring and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape descent is a film that went under the radar due to its lack of distribution because frankly the film is so brutal in its depictions that if it had been released theatrically it may have met itself to some strong biased hate the film deserves to be discovered for not only its dark themes and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style but most of all for its performances chad faust is absolutely stunning bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one not relate to but understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes but also the fragile insecurities deep within his own self it s a supporting performance that is so complex brave and emotional on faust s part and hard to forget however the standout is rosario dawson whose performance here is an absolute revelation a tour de force of realistic dramatic tics and one of the most subtle yet loud as can be performances in quite some time while dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great to bad films she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances believably and thematically one of the best films of its year and 2007 was a strong one had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release i would be screaming praises for it as well as dawson and faust too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal films like this deserve better 
__label__1 well i ll be honest it is not exactly a sholay but you cant get a sholay every week in fact you could see distinct signatures of not without my daughter sally field 1991 in this movie however as most inspired movies go this one was a well inspired one well handled and well done nana patekar as usual tends to overdo his hysterics but all others are commendable specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time but she hasn t lost any of her grace in fact she has performed much better that when i last saw her another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age all in all a nice watch 
__label__1 what a master piece to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future this film is satire of the highest order in my humble opinion it outranks dr strangelove the clever naming of the two superpowers as the confederation and the market cons being commies and market the west outstanding the clever use of gen joxs was ahead of its time only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989 the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government this movies screams don t do it you fools you ll kill us all excellent 10 10
__label__0 this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible there wasn t a continuous minute where there wasn t a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix examples the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and wait it hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them up uh hello and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrix or terminator there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazi s nazi s there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a children s movie or an adult movie and wasn t much of either just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money 
__label__1 may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids don t really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner may s husband says he doesn t feel well blames it on his daughter s cooking and irritably says he wants to go home he dies that night may now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her days she is depressed and unmotivated she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mother s arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she lets loose with anger over her mother s lack of nurturing may seems disarmed and surprised yet she also doesn t seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i m your mother and i love you what does really say i ve heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are needy though they show it very differently paula has been involved with a friend of her son s darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son nicky but supposedly doesn t live in the home with his wife may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of may s rationalization that what she is doing is okay at a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may s face as she endures the one time ghastly liaison eventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways sympathies will be divided at one point during paula s writing group may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn t like her having any friends so she didn t have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see may s actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother it is a well done film with more complexities than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions it is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeing one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable 
__label__1 this is a bit long 2 hours 20 minutes but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to cover it was soap operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments too capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film that was astounding to view considering this film is about 70 years old the special effects crew on this film did a spectacular job paul muni and luise rainer were award winning actors in their day and they don t disappoint here both giving powerful performances the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them like walter connolly just don t look real i d like to see a re make of this movie with all asian actors not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible 
__label__1 i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste but then i saw zentropa europa and my faith was renewed not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating the narrator max von sydow takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moving moment that leads you to death unlike many films it doesn t cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man s final moments i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email enjoy it 
__label__0 i wouldn t normally write a comment on line but this is the worst movie i ve ever seen not only that it s filmed just like a soap series the young and the restless is really filmed by professionals compared to this but it also has awful cuts it has no action it is full of useless garbage here s an example a guy wants to kill the main character as he got fired because of him so after loads of crap here they are the guy puts a knife at his throat and says something like you re dead now then the main character says if you kill me you re dead i ve told the police you re threatening me so the killer guy goes like just about to cry oh no the cops are following me oh my god remember this is just an example i really cannot believe this movie actually exists so if you want to see the worst movie ever go ahead i recommend it :)
__label__1 i have not seen this movie but i must having read all three of thor heyerdahl s books kon tiki ra and aku aku i am actively looking for a copy of this movie the thesis that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well considering that this crew had no gps and only an old fashioned valve tube radio with a 6 watt output their voyage was heroic to say the least please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video i would be interested in buying it 
__label__1 as far as horror flicks go this one is pretty darn good while it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if you re into the horror comedy genre 
__label__1 a milestone in eastern european film making and an outstanding example of serbian mentality a group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord with maratonci trce pocasni krug makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word 
__label__0 it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one i continued to watch every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously well as seriously as this genre requests the acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clichéd if a film was made in 1920 for example and had the quality of hide seek cord in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive as it happens this film was made in 2000 and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one definitely not for the serious movie goer not worth a rating 
__label__1 one of the great mysteries of life suffered from daily is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys worse when the nice guys even want to marry those girls the girls still prefer the jerks and heels even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt have shown they re just interested in using the girls stu erwin is the nice guy who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely clark gable is the jerk and he is perfect in the role rather a sad note to his fans jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters intended to be bad guys i mean heck they re locked up so they must be are so obviously nice people in fact there are lots of nice people here people who in a lesser film or story would be snarling and back stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else so maybe the story is rather clichéd at least by modern standards but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit once again we can say a fervent thank you to imdb com 
__label__1 the marriage of maria braun mmb is about a german girl maria getting married to a german soldier herman braun just at the ending of the war after being married for half a day and a night herman is send to the front again to make ends meet maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier she got word that herman died at the front and things develop between her and the american soldier herman walks in on them in bed and after a confrontation between him and the american maria killed the american herman admits to the murder ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him the country is in shambles one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette there are food shortages it is in short a time of survival of the fittest basically this film projects maria s attitudes those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances as a metaphor for germany s loss of soul after they lost the war and how it proceeds to rebuild itself for example maria has the following conversation with a peddler played by fassbinder himself the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that kleist burns out to quickly it does not provide enough heat for the cold the peddler answers that s another way to look at it right now it s probably the correct way maria meets a french german business man karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment she decides to get involve with karl you re not having an affair with me i m having an affair with you she also takes responsibility in the company and after a while has the complete trust of the firm when karl says i suppose we ll just have to wait for a miracle she replies i prefer making miracles then wait for them in her own words she has become the mata hari of the economic miracle in a lot of fassbinder s films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms see freud in other words he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh t the false social mechanisms the pretending the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology for example she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point i need someone to sleep with as fassbinder said the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society he also remarked that his films are anti emotional i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant apparently frequently visited by hitler himself maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side as if maria s brutal honesty wears him out as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore karl says i have to tell myself over and over that i love life maria replies that s life isn t it as if we signed a contract to enjoy life and then we go out to eat and talk about food i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships to never submit completely to anyone and why would you if the central matter of most of his films is about what love becomes in this society a commodity an instrument of power a weapon it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war with these clothing essentially the wrong period what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great but fassbinder was not interested in perfection any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project since he completed films approximately 4 a year the way other people rolled cigarettes it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes peter marthesheimer who wrote most of the script mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park overnight hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria mostly she just stares bluntly into the camera in maria s own words it is a bad time for emotions but i like it like that there are different opinions about the end after karl died of a hart attack herman finally shows up herman left for australia after he got out of prison to become human again after the testament is delivered made out to her and herman in half maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette and blow her and herman up for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident at the same time she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore she felt as if she had outlived herself 
__label__0 mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993 supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s now as a fan of japanese action films and series you would think i would get a kick out of this show you could not be more wrong what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie yet the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked it was followed by two really bad and i do mean really bad movie knock offs and the actors starring in this series completely disappeared from the scene if you must choose try watching japan s zyuranger series instead also what s up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys it makes them all look feminine 
__label__1 war is hell but this documentary of wwii is heaven not only is this series a breath taking almost exhaustive look at the second world war it s a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier this documentary series defines the genre it s sweepingly long no doubt but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year truly this is an impeccable bit of film making other than olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper i m going to go watch it right now again my 11th time 
__label__0 what did i just watch i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i ve ever seen the concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre i still am wondering how the character mark wasn t able to run away from the clown he s 300 pounds he s gotta get tired eventually the whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud what did i just watch apparently brandon is denise s cousin and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin yeah that s something people want so see shudders another thing i found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says what did you do well bytch what do you think he just did the last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch hiker and calling her a c nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence isn t helping anything did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy none of this movie makes sense anyway the movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which i got sucked into buying all 3 99 and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes i m surprised the fat clown didn t join the orgy would have fit right in i hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other b movies might have but i was wrong this is a moronic piece of garbage that s not even worth watching 1 out of 10
__label__0 awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren t any negative scores in the imdb com rating system zaphoidps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it s called an indirect proportionality quality 1 star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less z
__label__0 this mini series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations sotd falls somewhere between kung fu and h r pufnstuff on the entertainment spectrum if it weren t so long nearly 3 hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit it s got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other icky stuff when you re young you re not too critical of flexing rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie just as was done in old time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non asian actors i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it made overall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini van oh yeah hey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spell checking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both webster s and the oed consider it an alternative form 
__label__1 i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it i am ready to watch it again i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites of course the martial arts are stunning there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style however if you are not we paused playback briefly and walker texas ranger was on we noticed that after every strike there was a cut not in black mask 
__label__0 some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series particularly the writing ok the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink i m a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage nothing new or genuinely interesting few of them are visually creative it s just typical fabricated hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity other then that this series blows hard i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth graders to write the episodes maybe they did 
__label__1 this movie is a real gem the arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn their motives completely believable the dialogue is fresh and oh so real the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed until the climax that is then it s as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable but i don t want to discourage people from watching this film the first 3 4 s of it are truly remarkable i gave it an 8 there are some remarkable performances here check out this movie 
__label__0 bruce lee was a great martial artist but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn t explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air it just gets downright absurd from then like something out of a cheap comic book maybe the idea isn t so rotten but it isn t done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there usually all made in hong kong i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera even steven seagal s films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong game of death ii falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion despite bruce lee being in it 
__label__1 i felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else whether intentionally or not we are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective advanced nations i write from japan where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon pubs in england were once all male the business world was totally off limits for women in america until rather recently and women in china had their feet bound so they couldn t develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another back to the issue of sexuality we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game the official reason is that the men are bad especially such boyish girls a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well i think one point is that not all women are the same and the women the police are trying to protect are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place the opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in and each one separately at all it is a brutish man s world any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed the world of sexuality is not one size fits all meanwhile the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who knows where and in a much more subtle way begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them these had definite ideas about women and femininity which were being challenged head on the change in attitude is glacial but visible since the movie is pure iran from the first moment it takes a little easing into for the foreigner but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you and you end up getting the whole picture and even understanding the men s misunderstandings and give them slack the supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the ayatollahs which remain unseen and unnamed and likely unremembered knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the iran bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved 
__label__1 i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven not really a fan of either star i still wanted to see it because i m a huge thriller fan i was not disappointed the acting was superb especially from the two young boys usually i loathe child actors but young adam and young fenton were excellent bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too it was beautifully shot one must also note the plot twists the three twists at the end hit hard and fast and i didn t see them coming the final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though i ve re watched the film so many times a true gem 
__label__1 forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this wide screen entertainment was aimed at a mid fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the film s sometimes sluggish pacing doesn t help but the story s compelling central idea involving the ancient extinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasn t lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what i m mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it s elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic 
__label__0 this film reminded me of the sopranos and not in a good way david chase s seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season when junior soprano went on trial for his life rather than pursue this riveting and pivotal plot line the writers instead chose to completely ignore it focusing instead on bobby baccalieri s constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife s frozen pasta dish when something of genuine interest happens in notorious for example that first mysterious assassination attempt on tupac shakur that ignited the whole east coast west coast feud in the first place and ended up leading to the deaths of both tupac and christopher wallace the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through why exactly was tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with suge knight and was lil kim s transformation from prim office drone into sex obsessed vampish diva really as banal as it appears here none of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film s screenwriters who are far more interested in depicting wallace s turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail these sequences including a brain frazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network tv movie the storytelling in both structure and content is simplistic and trite but more fundamentally as a biopic as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work the film is almost entirely worthless the reliance on meat and potatoes genre plotting coupled with the lifeless musical performances an area in which a film like this should soar surely result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved leaving wallace s questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only and the final twenty minutes in which wallace s posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint quite frankly made me feel like throwing up on that score much as with any other notorious is crass calculating and compromised 
__label__0 ok so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955 i pity the fools who still think so its absolute rubbish the story is just ridiculous the characters are absurd caricatures but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn t it dean and others are too old for their parts people say dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could ve his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so but dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy its pathetic natalie wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing it sets a bad precedent for the film and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along it may ve been good for its time but really its drivel it must ve just been hype about dean s death that has over inflated the reputation of this film 
__label__1 very smart sometimes shocking i just love it it shoved one more side of david s brilliant talent he impressed me greatly david is the best the movie captivates your attention for every second 
__label__1 dirty sanchez is the more extreme british version of jackass in which the four boys pritchard dainton joycey and pancho go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny there are 3 series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg there s an episode on their love lives jobs etc the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations the third follows their european tour it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode 
__label__0 an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful so no new story lines here however the authors managed to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watching kids vomiting or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife s teeth out in a bloody horror type go see or rent the film if not move on to something else my fair lady anyone 
__label__1 i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch s works for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical lynch elements having seen most of his works i naively thought i could predict lynch s next step i was dead wrong dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch still after my recovery from the first shock i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities cruelty brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality being emphasized by distorting it there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize for they are either disgusting or horrible however they are surrounding us so i take the courage to say dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces this is not a movie to enjoy though you ll sometimes laugh out of a strange perverted sense of humor this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe with its simplicity morbidity and absurdity take it as it is you don t have to like it it just exists and finally if you re attentive enough you ll find elements typical to lynch as well i recommend it for tolerant people 
__label__1 i bought this while i was playing chess in hastings i am from denmark though it is very good definitely with an understanding of the horror genre the monster towards the end is very scary people who criticise this on imdb should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror critics 
__label__1 clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollinger s reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of it s unsavoury elements man with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it it s a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasn t done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought it s just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning story robert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we don t see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchum s shadow so really it s solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps it s unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the gun s minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and co written by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but it s dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable 7 5 10
__label__0 it s hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious i was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker the story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend s house and get drunk while doing so then it ll be enjoyable 
__label__0 you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason well out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t rex knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t rex from jurassic park i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie i was not disappointed in the least mad scientists secret formulas a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives and of course a big poorly animated sock puppet t rex is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies not to mention the rex s hungry is never satisfied ever how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn t have an throat really if you look down his mouth when he roars it s solid like a toy or something now i like watching incredibly bad b movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is this one was hilarious i m not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where make no mistake you will laugh do i blame the movie s budget yes but the acting didn t help either ok tony todd was actually pretty good as for some of the female roles when you cry shouldn t tears come out meh i am not going to be angry at this movie i knew what i was getting into and if you re looking for a bad movie to watch with friends here s what i recommend watch this movie then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back you will be writing mr spielberg thank you letters the next day 
__label__1 first ever viewing july 21 2008very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film now 40 years old it has lost none of it s power neil simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations jack lemmon and walter matthau give great comedic performances neil simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on one of the best written and acted hollywood comedies of all time surprisingly only nominated for 2 academy awards best adapted screenplay and best film editing hollywood rarely awards comedies no matter how well they are made 
__label__1 though i did not begin to read the classics in literature until i was 47 it s never too late jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isn t a part of the book i liked less only parts i enjoyed more the 1983 tv mini series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be i saw it as a full length movie in 2006 dalton s mr rochester was very good but i absolutely loved zelah s jane eyre relecting on another classics movie i saw recently i was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism using the title after such license is fraud leave it to the brits to get this one right among others you won t be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it s proper context and spirit well done bbc 
__label__0 another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot on video quality of the film it wasn t that bad rochon does a serviceable job and damn the cast is good looking i ve never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer but it was not to be my biggest problem with the film was that by the end i didn t much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking ha betcha didn t see that one coming sucker yeah there were continuity errors about mainly with ms rochon s ever changing wardrobe but for an indie slasher it s not that bad i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick the dialog was overly think and painful at times just don t have high expectations going into this and it won t be that bad and lloyd kaufman s cameo is wonderfully understated 
__label__1 john waters has made the most effusively buoyant heartfelt dark personal little film i think i ve ever seen well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second the directors vision is untainted the narrative is whimsical the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life the tone never forced or stylistically over arch there is no pretentious shot design ennui or magazine grading martha plimpton is amazing as the sister eddie furlong is inspired casting a grandmother with a talking mary tea bagging recycled clothing yesterday s garbage becomes today s art and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family and a humble life 
__label__0 it wasn t notable enough to be truly horrible it was just incredibly lame the story was not half bad but the execution was just horrendous to start with it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on it was just paced badly the dialog was so utterly un sparkling just flat and boring and the characters cripes almightly they made deadpool boring how the hell do you make deadpool boring he wasn t even funny he wasn t crazy he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly gambit was boring and since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves i mean we know they are mutants but they still exist within the realm of physics a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade you cannot fly by twirling super duper fast which gambit wouldn t be able to do anyway nor deadpool especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know wth they are doing and know better than to use it in every single shot as a replacement for real fight choreography three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics logan creed and wilson and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory it was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys and then you had the break out with all these mutants who did nothing even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers nice to see a quicksilver nod did f all when they got out only emma really lame for this film frost and cyclops did something and since when was logan so pretty and the stupid the bullet will take his memory away don t you think xavier and the x men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they x rayed him in x1 i felt sorry for liev schrieber man he actually brought in a good sabretooth considering the script he made one of marvel s more simple super villains feel real but he could not save the film from it s own epic lameness seriously this was daredevil level of suck decent story good actors absolutely horrible execution 
__label__0 usually i m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beens but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically corey haim s performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away 
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it s extremely boring with lots of boring dialog and has some very annoying characters and a laughable looking creature the only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got the plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale no blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds the acting is terrible richard cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying glen roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all mark siegel is extremely annoying and was also not funny bob hyman is decent but not much more then that richard garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with kacey cobb what so ever kacey cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with richard overall avoid this piece of garbage at all costs bomb out of 5 
__label__0 i ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago wow i still cant believe what i ve watched this is absolutely the worst movie ever if i would list all the flaws in the movie this review would take me a lot of sentences very funny flaws because of being that bad though you got to be amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane they didn t even know how to move ice t is so bad actor and the thing i don t understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero but he s a zero of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747 needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane amazing as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at all but i strongly recommend of watching this movie as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
__label__1  hitler the rise of evil was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film those who criticzed the film which they hadn t seen did so with good intentions based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler however they misunderstood the point to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of history s greatest villains were committed by a human being a sick diseased maniac to be sure but a human being nonetheless it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again rise of evil is highlighted by a brilliant career best performance from robert carlyle who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in the bunker another very good made for television film while were are repulsed by hitler s depravity and virulent ant semitism carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed after all while else would a nation have followed him of the various subplots by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich who makes it his life s work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism while modine s performance is a little stilted in part 1 by part 2 he seems to have settled in the character gives us a real life hero in a film full of villains peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong support part 1 of this two part mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy including a look at hitler s childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2 sections detailing hitler s relationship s with his niece and his mistress eva braun are less successful than the central plot but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional state ultimately no film about hitler can make us understand him the average person is thankfully incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people hitler the rise of evil tries less to make us understand hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions and the capability of doing anything but good 9 out of 10 1 2
__label__0 after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of stella street i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn t be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren t funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 4 10
__label__1 i m watching the series again now that it s out on dvd yay it s striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired the central performances are gripping the scripts are layered i ll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that ll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035 i ve been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way well unlike imdb s submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everything in 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation when the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally i m starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it don t get more controversial than that 
__label__0 really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i haven t seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you don t use a spoiled city brat look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy weller is german 2 10 because the photography could be worse 
__label__1 bravo to czechs their once powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post communist slumber the loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern hollywood production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years superb soundtrack excellent visual editing beautiful prague cityscape to mention but a few the story is actually comprised of several sub stories that frequently intertwain and overlap an is in essence a collage of destinies fates desires it follows a group of urban youth to mid thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions and it is hillarious there s actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in about a 100 people in a small art gallery laughed non stop for about 40 50 seconds how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions although the entire main cast is excellent especially the upcoming macedonian star labina mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all too familiar hardships i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situations conclusion don t miss this one it s got a lot to offer 
__label__0 i watched this movie last night on one of the pay per view channels and while watching it i quickly wondered why i bothered in all honesty i really did expect something more from this film maybe something along the lines of conspiracy theory why maybe because of the casting i mean nicolas cage and harvey keitel after all not to mention jon voight and christopher plummer now i m wondering why did they bother but instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama i was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a là the goonies which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise perhaps it s because the goonies was clearly targeted toward the pre teen and teen audiences whereas national treasure judging from the previews was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience suspension of disbelief is one thing it s how one can enjoy sci fi and horror but i found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracy laden tripe being shoved at the audience oh the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment wow the masons the knights templars you know this could really be true i think the writer really lost me when gates said the founding fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the british and just were did the knights templar come from new jersey oh i forget from france which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in philadelphia during the revolution it was brought there by agents of napoleon anyway you see what i m getting at the premise of the movie is interesting and i really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama but it just comes off as another kid flick in grown up clothing in the end i think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree i ve just finished watching several items by werner herzog and istvan szabo it s a shock to switch from fine dining to hollywood big mac and fries okay okay if you pant over chases explosions and gee whiz gimmickry you ll enjoy national treasure but it s the sort of movie well have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out and all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like wow did you see how that thing blew up that was so cool national treasure is that kind of movie 
__label__0 this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful ashmit plays the role of richard gere emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful though it couldn t catch up with the original it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors though the film bombed at the box office the actors got the undue recognition in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film all said this is not a family film so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family 
__label__1 john singleton s finest film before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake this is a thought provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters each with identifiable youngster problems what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social economical problems and racism by whites this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow it s not just about racism but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world college date rape discovering sexuality and isolation omar epps michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez yay and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riots the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne peppermint surely plenty of professors are nutty but they re not as flat the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature but i guess they are like that too in real life overall a great underrated piece of filmwork if you liked american history x you ll love this one 8 5 out of 10
__label__0 when i first tuned in on this morning news i thought wow finally some entertainment it was slightly amusing for a week or so but we have to face it these news reporters if one can even call them that have way too much playing around time at first i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air but seriously this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her she is very unprofessional she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report it s just really become annoying to the point that i can t watch it anymore jillian is not a good journalist hell she s more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity hence she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she s supposed to be interviewing she s not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist and that s all i can say about her also disappointingly this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world the government the us or something that will benefit and or serve the public s best interest they re too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product on the other hand their field reporters are interestingly tolerable i believe good day la is for young teenagers and celebrities and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news side note i d really rather watch ktla however they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes they re still a bit dull though oh well i ll stick to nbc s today abc s good morning america is also okay as long as diane sawyer doesn t become way too serious 
__label__1 in the immediate aftermath following world war ii sound minds in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort best years of our lives and even gentleman s agreement investigated the way americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war but delmer daves pride of the marines beat them to it the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole with japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies mariiines tonight you die he is blinded by a hand grenade and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home delmer daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave as it were almost by coincidence they are there in the foxhole and when shot at they react so much for heroism but they get the job done and then comes the self pity the dark gloomy sense of humor garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses there s no free candy for anyone in this world as his buddy tells him the same guy a jew played by dane clark reminds him in a war somebody gets it and you re it everybody s got problems when i get back some guys won t hire me because my name is diamond great movies are made with guts like these and if the first half hour of pride of the marines fails to rise to the occasion completely from then on it evolves into a true work of art you weep and you ponder you ache and you hope against hope well simply art 
__label__1  if i wanted to dribble i d call a nurse haven t you had enough more than enough you got me a choo choo if i begin to die please remove the cowboy hat from my head that is not the way i wish to be remembered some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotations from this charming and often insightful film dudley moore is charming lovable and rich sir john gielgud is aristocratic charming and loving and poor the two have a non father father and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth over twenty five years i ve returned to this movie with glee and amusement and joy it is a movie to return to time and time again and remember what is important in life as short as it is judge miller
__label__0 this is one lowly film it has no real plot we never are made privy to motivations other than wealth the characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film the threat seems to be supernatural but then it s being controlled by these three older people why are they doing what they are doing in order to strike fear into other members of the group i don t know there is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it does it do something i don t know there s some nudity for its own sake i m always surprised to see this in films this old things have actually settled down in this regard these days anyway the people run around like chickens ready for the ax they have no plan no resources no nothing there are about five silly climaxes in the film who are these people and is there a ghost or demon what happened to the other people i challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence what a mess 
__label__1 this is just about in the same league as the black cat although i d give this a 9 rather than a 9 that s praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing the invisible ray is part horror part drama and certainly part sci fi for a movie made in 1936 the sci fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time the mixture of horror drama and sci fi are a perfect blend while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn t be better director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often what i m saying is that this film is eerie and well shot the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi s room is a perfect example of the mood it s a standout moment in the film which is so sadly missing in today s movies of the genre as with the black cat and island of lost souls i can t understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd when you consider some of the junk that s already been transferred to dvd it s that much more puzzling anyway watch this film if you get the chance when it s released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library 
__label__1  originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bug s life was too much too fast he was dazed and exhausted by the visuals and seemed to ignore the story completely okay first off i m 26 years old have a job go to school and have a fiance so maybe i m nuts and just really good at hiding it but not only did i not come away from a bug s life exhausted or dazed it wasn t until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals because the first time i went to see this movie i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being wowed by each frame visually how can you not empathize with flik and his road to heck paved with good intentions life heck indeed i found myself identifying with that little ant not to mention some of the other bugs in a lot more ways than one and that in itself says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy of course it s beautiful every blade of grass the tree the rain of course what they can do with technology is amazing you can read their lips try it but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color no a bug s life would be static if it were all that and no story but i m glad to say it s not a bug s life has real heart yes there s a lot going on storyline wise as well as visually but that s because the story and characters actually have some depth to them just because it s a kids movie doesn t mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door kids are smarter than you think besides that i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves even before their kids and it shows in the amount of heart in has this movie is moving touching funny intriguing and generally engrossing the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing there s a major amount of character growth and not just of the main character so rare in animation and often in movies in general it doesn t hit you over the head with its points once it s made them every scene every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there and there are no gratuitous shots not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety to me folks it means not dumbing down your movie and assuming the audience is stupid which it mostly is not all i can think is if you can see a bug s life and not feel anything at all then you must have never made a big mistake hurt your friends had a crush fallen in love been frustrated that no one would listen to you lied to someone you care about felt like a social misfit gotten excited over a new idea come up with a great idea had what you thought was a great idea backfire been awkward one moment and confident the next felt the pressure of responsibility stood up for yourself and your loved ones stood alone against the crowd felt like a failure felt like a big success felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others well you get the point final words a rating from me please if you re going to see it try to see it in the theatre pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie if you loved toy story you ll most likely love this pixar knows how to make movies with heart if you do love it see it multiple times or you still won t know what you re missing the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable and whenever you re feeling really low just pretend it s a seed okay 
__label__0 freddy s dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that i m just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge it s almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they re just destroying it instead of reinventing the story this was a sequel that wasn t needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents freddy is back but he s got something we don t know about a daughter maggie she s not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but it s hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isn t it but freddy isn t giving up without manipulating her into his ways freddy s dead the final nightmare is also presented in 3 d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels it s tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series i d rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didn t like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows best 2 10
__label__1 i don t watch a lot of tv except for the office weeds entourage and e s soup i think i hold this show in good company i love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a sanjaya or heidi montag sp the best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments c mon most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the auditions which is why most people claim to watch and that means i don t have to suffer through the other 98 of these mind numbing talk shows or reality shows for one nugget of funny or shock the only reason why soup doesn t get a 10 in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny and on an even rarer occasion the commentary isn t always up to par but they can t all be home runs either if so soup wouldn t be on e joel s quick wit and soup s writing team which includes mchale make for a great show i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off camera even when they re being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs it s hilarious because it is forced they re obviously being ironic and that s part of what makes this show funny 
__label__0 this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was b movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell i m still laughing so as a shake your head in disbelief movie this one does well although it appears to have some known actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort the graphics might have been good in the 60 s or even early 70 s but come on this is 2009 i wont give spoilers out let s just say that if you have played jurassic park on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this filmit is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
__label__1 when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show yet while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like the day the earth stood still the incredible shrinking man invasion of the body snatchers war of the worlds and the thing from another world yet the best of the bunch for its literacy and production values was undoubtedly mgm s first big foray into a level science fiction forbidden planet released in 1956 it was a 98 minute color film directed by fred m wilcox that featured then state of the art special effects and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume from a screen treatment called fatal planet by irving block and allen adler who adapted aspects of william shakespeare s the tempest into it the film drew raves when it was released for its oscar nominated special effects its all electronic music score by louis and bebe barron although credited as electronic tonalities to avoid music guild fees vivid matte paintings inspired by chesley bonestell and the famed monster of the id moti which was animated by an animator joshua meador on loan from the walt disney studio even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot in his first role in either film or television later he would appear in the film the invisible boy included in this dvd as a bonus as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone night gallery and lost in space with whose own robot he is often confused and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins the tale is simple but elegantly constructed and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced love story aspect in the film in the 23rd century the united planets cruiser c 57d a flying saucer led by commander j j adams leslie nielsen yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days is en route to the planet altair iv to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon sent to the planet twenty years earlier after a year s journey there they encounter the lone survivor of the party doctor edward morbius walter pidgeon the prospero stand in a philologist his gorgeous blond daughter altaira anne francis the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt and robby the robot the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year yet he was immune to it all in all it s a technically good film especially with some rear projections and matte paintings and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmy s and robby s exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity yet it s manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures for it s played straight thus making it even funnier as for the main feature forbidden planet deserves all its kudos it s not a perfect film but it s a great way to spend a couple of hours and far better than star wars which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated and juvenile only such films like 2001 a space odyssey solaris alien and aliens and the first two terminator films have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects it s worth knowing that despite forbidden planet s happy ending there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta as well after all she is her father s daughter and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time also the film wisely only shows the moti once and never shows the krel for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale something that far more realistic art films often fail to do forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories watch it and you will agree as well as sleep a little less easy but even if you don t there s still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping that alone is timeless 
__label__0 although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one it s an ultra low budget canadian film two it s written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless it s woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible in a nutshell bad script bad acting terrible directing don t waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music blaring throughout how this got any attention i ll never know 
__label__0  from this awful movie there are so many things wrong with this film acting writing direction editing etc that it s amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst the music i noted that the film has two composers listed this must be the reason why every single frame has music of the absolute worst d movie style drivel they have never heard of the expression less is more it got so painful to listen to i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue not that the dialogue was that good you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley i m sure they didn t see roles like this in the twilight of their careers see it at your own risk 
__label__0 this film was absolutely awful i even feel uncomfortable calling it a film its the typical mumblecore movie with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to figure stuff out i have tried to give mumblecore a chance but lets be honest its just horrible i am not out of sync with cinema i appreciate dogme95 films idioterne is one of my all time favorite films so i do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some any substance everything in this film is horrid the acting the writing or was it all improvised the direction but most of all above everything else the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense the camera was never anywhere logical there was no consistency i got to admit being a guy i had heard there was nudity in this film so i thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there s nudity yea i know i m a jerk well thanks to the uber crappy camera work you never really get to see anything and the things you do see trust me you do not want to see this film made me want to vomit on numerous levels the dialogue made me want to vomit the camera work made me want to vomit but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit 
__label__1 i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer sue smith very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didn t need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from parental figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace life s possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much hyped somersault i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods i m glad i saw it 
__label__1 this is a run of the mill nature porn movie by porn i don t mean sex i mean gratuitous images of for example thousands of birds together or hundreds of walruses or a giant waterfall or iceberg several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film there is almost no plot in this film told to expect a story of three animal families better than march of the penguins the movie simply doesn t deliver the blame rests in three key areas 1 the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history 2 the music team who over dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to motivate and lastly but most importantly 3 the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film a film about life when we got to the whales halfway through the film i sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that i d be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen there was also almost no science in the film at all they attributed hot and cold all of it not just the seasons solely to the earth s tilt ignoring the fact that we d have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm and it would be worst if we had no rotation relative to revolution like mercury because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow exempt from the laws of nature so much for science i must credit the camera work however and again that is why i call this nature porn everything from super slow motion to what appears to be a finely tuned mechanically controlled time lapse photography was put to use to provide some and i caution only some stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films that said i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen some of the shots showing the great watering hole in africa as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it s all natural but they didn t do that for a film about earth i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown what we saw was pristine we had to take the narrator s word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes they didn t show us evidence of it they didn t show us alberta s poisonous tailing ponds visible from space they didn t show us the great pacific trash whorl they didn t show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet these are as much earth as anything else why cover it up for a feel good whitewash my last criticism of the content is of predation any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that mt doom scene from lord of the rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of sauron ultimate evil character but predators aren t evil they perform a necessary service ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive we are predators ourselves any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating don t really happen the final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat bad bear bad you can almost hear them say on to the presentation itself my theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own hdtv lcd at home but the picture was blurry and was presented in the same 16 9 ratio i could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days and during one action packed scene near the end the film i can t imagine this happening digitally from how it looked was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually blacking out completely that repeated about three times if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it but how will i know 
__label__0 of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle 
__label__0 i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren whom i hadn t seen in any movies since rocky iv unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr lundgren who was okay ish kata dobó was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make up the plot is not at all clever it s something that s been repeated a million times in different movies the crooks were utterly stereotypical and lundgren s character hadn t any depth in it i didn t really expect a movie masterpiece but unfortunately this is not even decent action every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over the top unrealism and comic book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic like action but only if nothing else is available 1 10 i guess the current average vote of 7 0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie 
__label__0 this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it as rino di silvestro s messy film completely lacks vision and if there is any point to the plot it wasn t put there on purpose werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a so bad it s good film but i completely disagree normally i enjoy films like this but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film and despite all the sex and savagery on display it doesn t even make for a fun watch and that really is unforgivable the film really doesn t have much plot but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf she dreams of going out and finding men having sex with them and eventually killing them back in the real world she falls in love but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters but they really don t do that and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic but the gore works well the premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation as there s plenty of naked women and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica but this isn t capitalised on and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines i really can t stand watching films and being bored overall i wouldn t even recommend this film to big exploitation fans there s plenty of better stuff than this out there and while the title may sound intriguing the film isn t 
__label__1 i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere well i ve never seen it anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance 
__label__1 in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks however it s also so bent on being realistic it s sometimes more clinical than entertaining recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family author truman capote focused on minutia wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles which surely they were they re not seen as misunderstood souls as in the capote book and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the capote character the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall 
__label__1 i expected this film to be a run of the mill 1930 s romance boy meets girl they fall in love boy loses girl boy wins her back in the end it wasn t like that at all clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby jean harlow s apartment to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub no less instant chemistry she plays hard to get for a while but a girl can only resist that grin for so long the heat between them is evident and there are some scenes that are definitely pre production code when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for troubled girls she is miserable and thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her begins to believe that eddie will never come for her harlow plays the hard nosed fast talking ruby perfectly she never lets gable get all the good lines there is an especially moving scene with her playing their song on the piano that is acted perfectly the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time a truly sweet romance 
__label__0 a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red _undertow_ is pointless and unengaging and made me think often of a phrase by twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together when someone brings up the category of worst films ever made it s not the likes of _plan 9_ or _attack of the killer shrews_ that i think of it s the likes of this what a complete waste of time my own and everyone who was involved with this flick 
__label__1 this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes 70 large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is paul s parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last character s side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping pong between our two protagonists escalating tit for tat until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they don t do as they are told the film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get paul s file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it woohoo they stuck it to the man 
__label__0 not only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak english with an australian accent they also call their stars by the same names our earthly astronomers have given them and topping all that off all alien life knows just how mean evil wasteful and destructive us humans are and they re quite willing to tell us just how bad that is if you ever have the chance to see this movie don t well unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia this movie tries to get a moral ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon 
__label__1 directed by samuel fuller who also wrote the screenplay pickup on south street is a tough brutal well made film about a pickpocket richard widmark who inadvertently aquires top secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex lover richard kiley it s film noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties and who also sells information she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won this should have been the role that copped it for her 
__label__1 until i saw this special on hbo i had never heard of eddie izzard i sure am glad that i have now he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie i could not stop laughing for the entire show if you like to laugh you have to see this special 
__label__0 hmmm where to start how does a serious actress like demi moore got involved in such crap first blood might be rated as bull t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits point of course if you are interested in the crapstory demi moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy seals that is the most stupid cliché one i can think of you ll say gi jane is a great movie just the performance from viggo mortensen made this movie bearable but hell i can t think of demi moore being rambo especially not during the last useless 30 minutes ridley scott doesn t deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights it s just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it awful movie 
__label__0 the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency there was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the year s best

__label__1  but the general moviegoer s mileage may vary in mary american psycho harron s stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of curves bettie page i ll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of ms page a prim and proper valedictorian from nashville tennessee who moved to new york in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the bondage queen of the universe nor will i run through the sketchy bio pic plot of the notorious bettie page though i offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind improper use of a period camera notwithstanding finally i won t belabor the timely applicability of the film s themes of innocence and perversion freedom and control the sacred and the secular they re there for the viewer to absorb if they wish the more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goes what i will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page truth is mol s face looks almost nothing like bettie s nor is she particularly built like bettie although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool i she doesn t even sport the thick dark bush that concealed ms page s most intimate charms but the fact remains that mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of bettie page in every way shape and form it is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semi obscurity i ve never met ms page and sadly never will most likely but i ve devoured the photos and videos and read all the bios and interviews available bought the trading cards and other odds and ends and to be honest lusted for ms page ever since i first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as i have come to conceive her no pun intended in what i consider to be an oscar worthy performance liv tyler could never have matched mol s shining intensity of characterization in a million years and i for one am grateful she left the project not that i d mind seeing her totally naked i hasten to add but i can t imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of bettie page the notorious bettie page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters legions of devoted page fans and the curious will see to that i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job mol has done beyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially lili taylor and chris bauer as paula and irving klaw whose celebrity photo business was bettie s doorway to immortality a final note to the young scribe who opined that ms page had no effect on his generation take a good look at madonna s cone brassiere and get back to us bettie page is whether you know it or not the true godmother of fetishwear without her madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed 
__label__1 i went into this expecting not to like it i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest and rather plodding and dull it s actually far better than that and i found myself really enjoying it i don t know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know married to albert who died young and she mourned him ever after seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating in fact i found myself wishing i d seen more of the story and i imagine we may see a sequel at some point visually the film is stunning the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top the acting is top notch from everybody involved in a word it was great 
__label__1 feroz abbas khan s gandhi my father a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi for a story that s as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell it s a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school now the film aims to convey one very interesting point the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father this point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england which gandhi twice denies his son instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head the director just moves along with the story thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal it comes off looking like he s over reacting the point i m trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did we never really understand why he turned to islam and then back again to hinduism the thing is we never really understand harilal at all and that s because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle a story most of us are already familiar with to put it simply gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father son relationship but it doesn t so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhi s son but show us why that was a burden to begin with show us incidents of their early conflict for example it s not enough that gandhi merely says he s opposed to harilal s early marriage tell us why this opposition it s not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate words are not enough show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi what s more instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship the film goes off on too many tangents thus diluting the impact of the central theme this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence and yet on many occasions that s exactly what it seems like because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment even though much of it has no relevance to the film s basic premise the stormy father son relationship so you see the problem with this film is not that it s a bad film but it s certainly a very confused film what happens to harilal s children after his wife s death does he ever have relationship with them where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba none of these questions are answered in a film that s basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself gandhi my father is a disappointment no questions asked cinematically it struggles to translate the filmmaker s ambitious intention to the screen practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade ins and fade outs never quite seamlessly leading into each other on the positive side there is inherent nobility in the film which you recognise the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative trying hard not to take sides never once judging either father or son painting neither as the villain what the film does do however is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation but evidently alienated his family of all the actors in the film it s only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck deprived harilal gandhi it s a wonderful performance and it s not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife s dead and you ll realise how much he conveys through body language alone darshan jariwala meanwhile who plays gandhi senior adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years but it s the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor s best contribution to that role the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba the woman who s meant to be torn in this father son conflict but if she s unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it s really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script much effort s gone into the making of this film and that s evident throughout but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you ll remember about it when you leave the cinema it s just so boring director feroz abbas khan s gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy and with this film the director makes us too 
__label__0 this movie had mediocrity laziness and thoughtlessness written all over it if you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already then you better do a damn good job i ll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it some scary horror movies just fail to break the mold of the lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies cliché this one sadly was no different and like all scary movies once you venture down that road there is no going back and the ending how do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end the ending was very anti climatic and spelled part 3 which i will never watch terrible movie 
__label__1 regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem la bête of 1975 one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors la bête is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy tale like atmosphere quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise the fact that beastiality of sorts is one of the film s central themes did certainly not help it with the censors but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience pierre de l esperance guy tréjan the head of a french aristocratic family has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin pierre benedetti to marry lucy broadhurst lisbeth hummel the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family due to an old curse mathurin s uncle marcel dalió is strictly against the wedding when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda sirpa lane and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever dream without giving away too much i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film as bizarre as it is la bête is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style settings and cinematography the fever dream like atmosphere is present within and out of dream sequences the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic elegant female nudity ravishing actresses to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting close ups on horses genitalia while having intercourse in either case it is not likely to be forgotten the entire cast of la bête is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters some of which are seriously demented the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast be it lisbeth hummel in the lead finnish actress sirpa lane who sadly died of aids in 1999 as the ancestor in the dream sequences or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film the scenes with the eponymous beast definitely being among them certainly not everybody s cup of tea but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema a true cult gem 
__label__0  unhinged is one strange little film a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre it s hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique it s plot is fairly overdone three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter very quickly the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic on top of that the mother and daughter seem to have a very very strange relationship as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them halfway through the film when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help the killing begins as far as the acting goes this film is at the bottom of the barrel none of the three stranded girls can act particularly the lead girl it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the film the mother and daughter are better but not much the film is also quite dull in parts and really really drags the killings are gruesome but nothing we haven t seen before however as mentioned on here the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic sleepaway camp unfortunately the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring boring pacing the isolated creepy looking mansion and the dark foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes 4 out 10
__label__1 when reading a review from another user saying that it s a terrible game i could not stand idle and do nothing well this game is great from the news clips with two real persons full of humour sense and credibility to the story i find it very good i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions when riding the bike here and there except that it s a great game with a great story good graphics excellent characters great soundtrack i recommend it surely it can be a bit old but still enjoyable at least on the dreamcast but the ps2 version shall be the same

__label__1 i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film not to mention surprised i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr the performance was so finely nuanced neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro not the baby faced mr mohr a very impressive performance indeed and it s gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky indie films 
__label__1 i gotta say clive barker s undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made i ve played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud 
__label__1 comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth arms and the man proves that notion to be false shaw s play is full of comedic drama combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth on one level arms and the man is a successful and somewhat unique romantic comedy the young melodramatic and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fiancé and her father are both military officers she is shocked one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier she rescues him knowing that she ll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever and the soldier eventually leaves of course once the war is over that soldier comes back forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot shaw manages to comment on class constructs on the absurdity of war and even on the nature of love and of course he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw s best works arms and the man is both an amusing and thought provoking movie that retains its relevance even today more than a century after it was first conceived shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure the play has flashing wit buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms a good example of shaw s dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis i m a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i haven t to you re only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement indeed as a swiss hotel keeper s son bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically shaw s arms and the man should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war 
__label__0 take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative revisionist history and you get aztec rex apparently hernand cortes before conquering the aztec empire had to first conquer a tyrannosaurus rex and her mate that s the thrust of this movie given the plot it could have really sucked the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers there are a few problems for starters cortes is played by ian ziering even with a black wig ziering as cortes is about as convincing as axl rose playing gandhi and though cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of mexico the aztecs here seem to be played by an all hawaiian ensemble casting aside the t rex es look reasonably good though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed cgi and they die too easily i suppose if a t rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary 16th century weaponry but it takes something away from the movie there are also some graphic t rex swallowing human scenes which is surprising but in this context i thought they worked ok there s plenty of action and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but doesn t overwhelm the dinosaur angle unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie warbirds overall a mediocre but decent by scifi original standards movie that rates a modest 4 
__label__0 the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek l engle said of the film i expected it to be bad and it is i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind 
__label__0  only minor spoilers except as noted i ve enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro whose superb devil s backbone set in civil war spain was the finest horror film of the last decade it s no surprise then that this film is both well made well acted and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere but it s also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see what actually is the purpose of all this we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence set more than a decade earlier we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control freakery if i can t have you nobody can oddly enough that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree which appears completely different in both motivation and execution what happened to him in jail to cause this change we have no idea though we do later discover as an absurd sort of afterthought that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned in britain in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases the terrible question arises what about the wife did she know or suspect what was going on this is a question that this film could have asked and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters but banally the answer to the question is quite clearly no she didn t even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate the film still manages to bungle it all we actually get sketched perfunctorily out at the end is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place where christie s wife says you know what i mean thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror major spoiler in this paragraph in the meantime we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again how exactly did he achieve this the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police but how this all works or why or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds remains a mystery i actually don t believe serial killers are like this the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff but lecter aside it gets its serial killers right they are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply inadequate people not the creepily charming mastermind presented here closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie or indeed even man bites dog though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire this film has little suspense and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers either generally or in the specific cultural milieu of spain this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women and oddly what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory just one explicit shot properly timed would have been infinitely more shocking and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear very very creepy i m sorry to be rude i love horror films and can tolerate even the most extreme to the extent even of worrying my partner but i think anyone who finds this film good or interesting even i d find myself edging away from the purpose of a horror film is to scare you this is just lascivious it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed i have to give this film more than one star just because it s competently executed but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made 
__label__0 i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90 s i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot s and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana n w a public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60 s and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren t thinking i am living in the 60 s or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
__label__0 if you read my review of syfy s dinoshark you know that i can appreciate the low budget schlock that these made for television movies can provide they re stupid they re silly but they re still pretty fun in a so bad it s good kind of way so still smacking with guilt for liking and recommending the undeniably hokey dinoshark i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy a syfy original movie about a half man half hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island with the syfy channel s sure fire recipe for creating b movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo how could it possibly go wrong well to my surprise it actually misses the mark not by much but enough to make me not recommend it why well first of all its titular monster the dreaded hammerhead human hybrid takes a backseat to a bunch of faux military thugs who really become the movie s primary villain though the hammerhead does rack up the body count he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after the rest of the movie is filler pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers that to me is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people please read the full review on my blog www horrormoviejournal blogspot com
__label__1 with a minimal budget a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i ve ever seen the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable since it doesn t give the ending away until the very last moment don t let anybody tell you what the short is about since you ll be able to enjoy it a lot more nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one man show directing writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i ve seen in years also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer her reaction shots are incredible overall rating 8 10
__label__1 as i mentioned previously john carpenter s 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by the other being the classic conan the barbarian it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers whom i eventually befriended imaginary friend to keep him from killing me in my sleep now that is terror for a 10 year old it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious this all could happen it isn t in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country as most modern horror is i e hostel touristas cry wolf saw etc at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday middle class suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister he then spends the next 15 years in an institution which we thankfully do not experience only to escape and return to his hometown the infamous haddonfield on his way he kills and kills the child s name is michael meyers though he is not a person john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia in the bastion of american safety and security chaos can still strike michael ceased to be a person once he killed he is not a serial killer human being or psychopath he is as unstoppable force the generic overalls bleached white shatner mask and lack of any dialog other then some breathing helps to dehumanize and complete michael s generification this is the source of all his power he is faceless speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos this is helped by the cinematography post card effect a lack of information motivation explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence dr loomis his over the top performance and uneasiness sells the shape this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds at least for a little bit though this isn t the first movie of this new niche of horror films black christmas came out 4 years earlier it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing if you haven t been scared by horror movies in a long time like me this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter s career 
__label__0 funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float sure they used various actors for batman but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape in this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for christmas somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original if i had not known it was a sequel i wouldn t have guessed it from the cast except of course charles grodin tries so hard to imitate darrin mcgavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better they should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel this one is just a cheap imitation the ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die 
__label__1 as a big time prince fan of the last three to four years i really can t believe i ve only just got round to watching purple rain the brand new 2 disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it wow i was really looking forward to watching it but i wasn t prepared for just how electric it actually is prince s musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding he really has the moves in this one i am very familiar from repeated listens with the classic purple rain album and all its songs but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics like computer blue the beautiful ones when doves cry and purple rain itself there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform the closing songs baby i m a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid 20s he s overflowing it blew me away it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams drive her to a lake make her jump in then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film s overall charm morris day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style i love their dancing in this bit and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid performance i already can t wait to watch it again i really can t extras are terrific particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre beverly hills cop admit he is a prince groupie 
__label__1 i don t remember this film getting a cinema release over here i only saw it when it came onto cable the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an off world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space and would have been happy if it was i m certainly happy it was nt kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple the scene where he s sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slow mo replays detracts from the moment this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner alien silent running logan s run or thx1138 were however it is unfortunately the nearest i ve seen to it in a long time he changes in the movie to a believable degree he does nt crack arnie one liners he does nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending that s why this film did nt do well it did nt follow formula and among a 18 25 year old target american audience that s unforgivable as it was was nt what they expected to see fear and discipline always 
__label__0 considering the potential this move had the reality was disappointing while it s always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie even that couldn t turn this around most of the action was predictable the jokes were flat to mildly amusing and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened ben stiller was hilarious in there s something about mary here it looks like he s just going thru the motions if they have to lift plot points from friends they should have known something was wrong the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet watch 50 first dates instead :)
__label__0 san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didn t even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh i ve been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrap stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competent the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries the white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didn t know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows it s not groovy to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting this was not the hunter s point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco you ve seen it done before and you ve seen it done better even the video game was better despite the generic non locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong hands ps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one

__label__0 i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was i usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so revolting that it wasn t even entertaining some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the hideous special effects when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate and the disgusting acting the acting in fact is what i feel steals the show i didn t recognize any of the actors in the movie and i hope that i never have to see any of them again overall i recommend renting this movie if you can find it i can t imagine a video store carrying this garbage just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash 
__label__0 this is probably one of the worst wanna be a low budget hit films to credit the dinosaur genre the film is so predictable you could go away cook yourself dinner go answer the phone or whatever and when you re back you ll know exactly what has happened the special effects are so poor you would have thought lego bricks were used and the super fast dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator the acting is over cooked they try so hard yet there just isn t enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist yeah okay we know exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses stereotypical was created for films like this if you want to watch this film i suggest you aren t in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were and if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them don t watch it you might break the screen the facts are that far off

__label__0 rather than move linearly from beginning to end this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids orbits in time around their perfect day the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced the narration has its lyrical moments particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment on their second accidental encounter clearly smitten with each other sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week but the moment guy begins to open up phillip an english major blurts out you re not a crisis fairy are you later watching his lover s naked chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words the way you cut through space i can t even describe it but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes bejeweled with lines like what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons and you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller flattened than they need to be phillip s thoroughly annoying friends an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining needy dweeb maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary but sadly their remarks are merely unpleasant ungraced by wit or insight it s hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether s perimeter the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film it does seriously explore 1980 s us middle class gay life first encounters courting coupling nesting the complexity of open relationships friction and fracturing dissolution physical abuse rapprochement forgiveness terminal illness death and survival leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film s painful weaknesses the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out of sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear could i recommend the film to sticklers for literary and technical quality absolutely not for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in maybe but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia and the band played on longtime companion angels in america an early frost parting glances love valour compassion and even jeffrey

__label__1 titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies it has its problems what movies don t but still it s enjoyable when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you don t i know so many people who don t like this movie and i m not saying i don t see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isn t it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesn t actually exist but this is a movie doesn t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think it s unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected and finally if one is going to complain that they don t like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then i m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things it s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best i ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each other s names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall it s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it i give this movie 10 10 not because i like romance movies but simply because it s an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events 
__label__1 having looked at some of the other comments here i have a main complaint with this presentation the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways the beautiful victim and the handsome obviously extremely off center blue collar protagonist if just short of totally deranged take turns beating the hell out of each other sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario this is all right and this is of course mainly a turning the tables story however my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught up in his desire to display farrah s well known and obvious physical attributes beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect while immensely pleasing to the eyes these distract from the poignancy level of the drama her roommates i m certain give performances as written and directed however their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing don t ring true based upon farrah s previous experience with this guy the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred but this is a film and story compelling as much in spite of as because of the director s work 
__label__1 all dogs go to heaven plays on the canine criminal underworld the film is a delight for children with a comical and dark but satisfying and happy ending storyline with plenty of song and dance it features outcast charlie a fellow canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead he meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self sacrifice this is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child i would highly recommend this film to children i m unsure about how adults would react to it i tried to watch it a few years ago on vhs but those recordings don t last long do they 
__label__1 this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well low budget cameo type roles well executed the story is a little weak a recently widowed judi dench decides to round up the blonde bombshells a all well almost all girl band who performed during the war in london the obligatory son daughter who thinks she s gone potty i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don t have a monopoly on feelings love and even lust that the old wrinklies can have a good laugh too judi dench was superb as always a pity we didn t get to see more of the other blonde bombeshells the end was a little rushed i thought i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm although he was quite adequate as the transvestite drummer all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls :)
__label__0 hmm hip hop music to a period western modern phrases like cool and too many others to keep track of the sistahs are in tha house french manicured nails on hard riding girls microphone packs clearly visible on li l kim s back i just can t go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors the acting isn t as bad as i ve ever seen the women did well enough with a poor script it was weird hearing louis mandylor speaking in his native accent the girls are beautiful the costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect i just can t believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story i would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city 
__label__0 luckily i did not pay to see this movie also i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie it was that bad i laughed once when the yahoo billboard fell on the guy and the theme song came on however that was only because i thought it was making fun of it but then i realized it was yet another product placement i loved the cartoon i used to watch it almost religiously although i missed the last episode i heard that they show dr claw and it was nothing more than a claw somebody comment on the show s page the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had as to that point i hated the setup of the whole thing reminiscent of robocop then broderick screws with the whole feeling of inspector gadget he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point i saw except for the oil slick he also screwed with the tone of wowsers which used to be in an excited tone i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly everybody else felt that way too us 14 17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it i went into the movie with an open mind knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon i was taken aback at how retarded the movie was it relied on sight gags and stupid dialogue for humor disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along product placement is pointless in this film and it shows the wise cracking car is not that good at cracking wise the gadgets look nice but they were almost overly glossy the cartoon was a better look the silly scenes were crap in the 40 45 minutes i watched the movie not one laugh was heard and they laughed at the dudley do right preview this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment i highly recommend the iron giant which was sad but very very good this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama 1

__label__0 if this is based on the true life relationship as purported between ms curtin and mr levinson i m thrilled i do not know them personally this is painfully slow and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy 
__label__0 i watched this immediately after seeing hillside cannibals so anything would have been an improvement on top of that it stops me from comparing zombi 3 to 28 days later and its sequel unfortunately the more i watched it the more i realised how well made danny boyle s original was and how much this movie influenced 28 weeks later one can t help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of italian horror movie i was totally convinced zombi 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest in which case i would have called my summary 28 years later geddit but wasn t until i came to this page to find it was released in 1988 all the production values scream that it s a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade i might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity for example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a dj likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they ve had their head chopped off wait till you see the fridge scene you might just die laughing even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he s a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career obviously you re reminded of the earlier film the crazies which also reminded me of the later 28 films bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you ll have worked out that basically everyone dies the problem with this is you ll instantly be reminded of how the british franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie zombi 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience
__label__0 it is enjoyable and fast paced there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen however the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy while his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging in particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and well balanced and worked very well it is only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complex more key is the style of the whole thing it is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly australian 
__label__0 ridiculous this movie is actually a vehicle for the ramtha school of enlightenment if you are wondering who the bleep ramtha is ramtha is a 35 000 year old spirit warrior who appeared in j z knight s kitchen in tacoma washington in 1977 knight claims that she is ramtha s channel she also owns the copyright to ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks hollywood s version of elizabethan english in a guttural husky voice she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as ramtha at seminars 1 000 a crack and at her ramtha school of enlightenment and from the sales of tapes books and accessories clark and gallo 1993 she must have hypnotic powers searching for self fulfillment otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold muddy doorless maze john wheeler one of america s finest theoretical physicists would roll his eyes about this movie he has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory this movie does the same thing as those fools there is a great review of this movie at skeptico i recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult s coffers http skeptico blogs com skeptico 2005 04 what_the_bleep_ html i noticed one reviewer here at imdb say to take this movie with a grain of salt it will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage thinking of this movie 
__label__1 well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don t consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman s best

__label__0 pointless boring film with charismatic mercurio completely wasted released for a minute on a thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of sydney except me and four others back of beyond is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee local actors like john polson and terry serio deserve better well polson has morphed into a director of lame thrillers like swimfan and hide and seek and terry serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles but paul mercurio should have become one of australia s greatest exports on screen roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time 
__label__1 one of my favourite films it has everything rocking soundtrack courtesy of eddie clark ex motorhead loads of action loads of laughs totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful 80 s stereotypes as characters eddie the put upon nice guy who just wants to be left alone to be different leslie about as wet as they come nuke the rock burn out eddie s mom pathetic roger the geek and ozzy as the preacher surely he exists in america then there are the boys rich vicious and stupid and the girls vacant vain and stupid what more could you ask for well first of all there s sammi curr the rock star an amalgam of every 80 s badass rocker you can think of what about that rocket firing guitar then there s the scene where sammi pulls the old lady through the tv screen and smashes her up and what does roger do why hoover her up just like a good geek would my favourite scene is where tim hainey gets his long overdue reward from sammi via the wet finger in the plug magic if you were into rock in the 80 s or just love ridiculous films like i do then check this one out it s available on dvd and very cheap so trick or treat yourself 
__label__1  stairway to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never duplicated i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen stairway to heaven is a psycho drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique for example there is the combination of b w and color footage as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in oz in stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful another brilliant aspect of stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still literally and then there is the stairway itself if you have any imagination at all you will agree with me stairway to heaven is a true gem 
__label__0 first off let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts so i have a soft spot for fanpro stuff that means i ll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly so on to st hf well first off the good things enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles next the effects aren t bad for a home brew effort with nothing to make you really wince the stories aren t too bad either nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story arcs but it has a lot of faults first off although they quite obviously have to rip off star trek footage set backdrops music and effects i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci fi musical score ever made everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another likewise much of the footage is from other movies dutifully cgi d over to make it look different the grey warships for instance though disguised are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers likewise sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage in one scene in either first or second season i think you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to grimace at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons they ve also made some interesting acting choices let s just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at that make up effects are generally quite effective on the whole but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots they are just beyond unrealistic every time i saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that this is a stick up in one scene a cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these not only do the lips not move but the mask doesn t even have an opening where the mouth should be someone needs to be slapped hard for that couldn t they have taken a craft knife to it for goodness sake there are also some well done but unintentionally funny make up jobs such as the herman munster look alike the writing though coherent is nothing new instead the script runs like a continuation of ds9 with the ships heading out from ds12 on various missions the new enemy the grey aren t very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads i e starfleet meet the grey the grey are hugely powerful starfleet barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc all done before with the borg another bone of contention is the dialogue star trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc in other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand the words are just gibberish really i ve no problem with this but where st hf makes a mess of it is where they include real world comments into this concept tactical advice such as we need to regroup sounds good but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group likewise when asked what the situation is a tactical officer is heard to reply we count three battleships he actually needed to count them c mon i expected the questioner to ask him are you sure or can you double check but my all time favourite comment is this captain can we establish two way communication comms officer no we can only send and receive well duh having said all the above the show does improve as it goes along seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad 3 shows an improvement but 4 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better season 6 so far looks quite reasonable i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though quicktime sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx avi format the better some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor not only does quicktime make this difficult but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well in fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a tenth generation vhs tape copy the least they could do was to include a hi res downloadable option anyway the show has promise and i m even beginning to like some of the characters but that s 40 episodes on so i m not sure this says that much about character development at all but what can you say it s free ps out of 28 votes 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10 hmmmm were we watching the same show or are you 19 all three year olds 
__label__0 this movie is so bad you almost feel contaminated by it actually there is a strong sense of relief when it s over relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would phone in his performance i meant that he would not be trying very hard but lo and behold in a huge number of scenes in this film bill hurt is actually on the phone our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible there is a very slight resemblance to falling down but that film had a boldly disturbing story line great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack contaminated man is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don t speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up you get the picture don t get this one 
__label__0 there s a lot of movies that have set release dates only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind and then put in limbo for a long time you can only wish a film as rotten as slackers remained in a coma for what it s worth which is miniscule release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela i don t like to give spoilers out but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception angela falls for david ethan intentionally screws everything up the good guys win that s what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre gross humor is funny it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic animal house to the likes of contemporaries like there s something about mary and road trip amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far case in point ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself no one wants to watch a young man singing she ll be coming around the mountain with a sock on his penis but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50 s bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old i don t know if it s the story s lack of coherence which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer and after reviewing this film you can only wish he ll go back to the profession the worst thing you can do on any film is to make it look like you re having fun because you detract from your objectives just like slackers does by burying it s plot outline under a pile of gross out gags pointless vignettes and lack of construction it s like a bunch of college students got drunk took one s camcorder and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that s actually good then i suggest american pie and animal house or road trip just something that s entertaining and not dreadfully bad like slackers coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film just as she did in another bad film such as the sweetest thing where the story treats gross humor like another plot instead of a device much like this disaster if you pass by slackers at your local video store just keep on walking and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves 
__label__1  foxes is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it porky s fast times at ridgement high the movie holds up well against time its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio remember him lead a fine young cast that s well worth watching the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy away but rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike the film s opening a long and loving pan sets the tone for what follows we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola while donna summer s on the radio is scored beneath from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life annie runaway rocker cherie currie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill deirdre kandice stroh is the boy crazy drama queen madge marlilyn stroh is the shy girl in over her head and foster is the one with the plan it s her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line sally kellerman it s an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at despite its age foxes remains a pleasure to watch dated hair clothes and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill haven t hurt the movie the cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the l a basin at dawn dusk and at night giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ian perhaps the movie s biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st elmo s fire 1985 or empire records 1995 foxes shows why they should have but perhaps like bowling for soup s song 1985 they just hit a wall 
__label__1 having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can t do anything film a bad script and in some cases don t seem to care well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release it is good the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role ok he s not oscar material yet but he ll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie ultimately just give it a go you won t be disappointed you won t be bored in fact i think you ll be more than happy with the end result 
__label__1 this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry this movie will also tell you why indian movie goers are astute buyers amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it zanzeer saw the making of angry young man lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master servant loyalties but then the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song dance and drama what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero amitabh s vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent to me this alone is the biggest pull in the movie the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing amitabh by now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies thanks to manmohan desai this movie had a good dose of them the shoe caper in the party the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare s considerations the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody finicky character remember him asking ranjeet to shaaadaaaap after the poisoned cake incident his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant but prakash mehra knew the indian mind and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie but this is a caper remember and as long as it stayed that way the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy the end is always predictable and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol the age old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well so what is it that makes this movie a near classic amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story chuck the story the characters and the plot my marks are for amitabh alone 
__label__1 a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see 
__label__1 since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off it was just scary as to how real it really was the acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness diane keaton portrayed the main character patsy mccartle who had two sons whom she adored her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen it was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard but so true i have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie from what i remember i also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman yet it was done so well i applaud the director for making this movie i highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them 
__label__0 have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtz s character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have the bottom line obvious plot one note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors 
__label__0 i don t know maybe it s because i m brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on it s not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties i m not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and stds i liked the scene with caridad s mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people 
__label__0 the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer director star or is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this you want to make a movie tell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads if i m to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy 
__label__1 i generally love these 1930 mystery police charlie chan type of movies and this is no exception however something seems bad with this movie a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real but a commonplace occurrence 
__label__1 this is a story of the winchester rifle model 1873 the gun that won the west to cowman outlaw peace officer or soldier the winchester 73 was a treasured possession an indian would sell his soul to own one winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre the story sees stewart as lin mcadam pursuing the man who killed his father riding into dodge city with his trusty friend johnny williams millard mitchell lin runs into dutch henry brown stephen mcnally the man he wants but with wyatt earp will geer having taken all the guns from those entering the town both men are unable to have the shoot out that they are ready for the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle a competition that lin eventually wins but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize dutch ambushes him steals the rifle and skips town fast as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle the rifle will changed hands a number of times with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches very much a benchmark for what became known as the so called psychological western winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past tho shot in black and white the only one of the duos westerns that was the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on horseback and in silhouette amble over a hillside as they make their way to dodge city it s just the starting point that would see mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as mcadam proving once and for all that he was one of americas finest and most versatile actors the support cast isn t too bad either shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo while mitchell mcnally geer and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings there s even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far originally the film was a project for fritz lang who even had the script ready to run but lang walked away from it something that proved to be a blessing for western fans for as great as a director that lang was with mann directing and with a new script from borden chase robert richards in hands it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre not only with the further efforts that mann stewart produced but also in who they influenced the likes of budd boetticher nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes and gleefully for the western purists they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further a big hit at the box office back on release winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age 9 5 10
__label__0 wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad every time i thought that the movie couldn t get worse it proved me wrong the story was good but the actors couldn t carry it off also they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done for instance you don t handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff so that almost seemed depressing i thought that the characters wern t explained well enough you didn t find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them 
__label__1 if you re going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright william shakespeare and if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals in a kentucky correctional prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results this film shows how it was all done the casting the rehearsals the set and costumes and the final presentation of shakespeare s play the tempest it had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison in the play the ship wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world prison life too is much like that with a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure more interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character one inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins it was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation one had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions however as someone said the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future at least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events the prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place such an event would put kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example it seems to me that everyone stands to benefit not only the kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole 
__label__0 i guess it s jack s great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is but empathy comes at a price like all things when he s surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it he is a joke as a mafia hit man also because the part doesn t suit him one bit him being so extroverted and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this kathleen turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes when she opens them wide which she s convinced is sooooo damn sexy and anjelica huston is the absolute same granted interesting in everything just like robert loggia the movie is a lame draft and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script of a gangster movie with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after party faster they certainly gathered the party going elite in this what did they shoot it in 1 day cause that would be the only explanation 
__label__0 someone actually gave this movie 2 stars there s a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn t spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary this film is well i guess it s pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits apart from the acting plot story sets dialogue and sound i wrongly assumed it was about zombies watching it is actually quite scary in fairness you re terrified someone will come over and you ll never be able to describe what it is and they ll go away thinking you re a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines i m so taken aback i m writing this review on my mobile so i don t forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1 6 to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered i worst film i ve ever seen and i can say with hand on heart it will never never be topped 
__label__1 no other movie has made me feel like this before and i don t feel bad like i don t want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie 9 months nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______ the reason i say _____ is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just can t seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather no movie has ever done this to me before never in my life have i wanted cauliflower milk and baguettes this much thank you eduh clears throat no words no thoughts i don t know i truly don t know cait
__label__0 this movie is just plain terrible slow acting slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn t have been on there the best part was the showing of iron maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost avoid it 
__label__0 i m not saying that because the production values were so low but because it was filmed terribly that shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot it was terrible the lighting was just plain bad you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking you could barely hear what they were saying did i watch the whole movie of course not i skipped through most of it and i don t want to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it s just plain terrible awful movie don t waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh but even then it s not because of the actors funny lines it s because of how painstakingly bad the production is 
__label__1 this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in 92 i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs she was saying something like don t let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she d been watching the woman in black so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s out of me i ve been immune to horror films since watching this 
__label__0 jeff lowell has written directed over her dead body poorly the idea is first of all is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance paul rudd looks jaded and least interested lake bell is a complete miscast she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance jason biggs is wasted so is lindsay sloane i expected entertainment more from this film sadly i didn t get entertained 
__label__1 cor blimey this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy the soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained this carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film ron pearlman for example i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for it 
__label__1 i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this transposition is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense in a word perfect emma is one of austen s most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters the movie respected this subtle irony not disregarding the comic element miss bates above all what engaged me in the novel and the movie renders it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern i think of the morbid interest in other people s lives or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women s relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one s feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and out of time value the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it toni colette is simply great and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear and then the breathtaking english countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie 
__label__1 i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007 i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent it s one of my favorite show ever i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule that is really sad i hope they will bring it back maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby or is it only my wishful thinking i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks similar to mine i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up 
__label__1  that 70s show is definitely the funniest show currently on tv i started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show i like all the characters but my personal favorites are fez and kelso leo was also an awesome character while he was there i really hope he comes back because he s hilarious it s classic when fez goes you son of a bitch and when kelso yells burn that always makes me laugh they are both great characters and always have something funny to say jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show she started out being really good looking but damn somewhere around season 5 6 she just got really hot i ve seen most of the episodes more than once some like 10 times and there still hilarious this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it the cast is classic almost everyone is funny where with many shows there are only a few funny characters i will be sad to see this show end next year but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever 
__label__1 the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation inoue replaces yasuzu masumura blind beast red angel manji in the director s chair but the style is pretty much the same perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer apart from the titular antihero hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake of course hanzo being hanzo he s not put off by the fact she s a ghost so he proceeds to rape ahem interrogate her using the now familiar revolving net device the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks corrupt officials promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash hanzo s superior officer onishi and his two servants provide the typical comedic notes and generally it s business as usual significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first which is all over the place and a bit of a mess less stylish dramatic and bloody than the second arguably the finest in the hanzo series but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits complete with trademark training sequences the obligatory rape swordfights and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate this will ultimately satisfy the fans 
__label__1 many people like this movie and many more love it but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is many people say the acting was over the top but who better to do an over the top character than al pacino to say that pacino went over the top in here would be an understatement yet he does it so well he just brings the inner devil out of you so well his character tony montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level an inhumane level sure at times pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all the supporting cast served its job very well michelle pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played on the other hand steven bauer was at his best still he is steven bauer mary elizabeth mastrantonio was good and like michelle pfeiffer fit her role very well robert loggia i have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell other than pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there they did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough brian de palma did a very good job directing this movie whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and i will certainly give de palma that brian de palma though not given the respect is a very versatile director by my count he knows how to direct movies according to their genres but that at times has not turned out well in here it does this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of de palma the writing was great it was just pure oliver stone when i saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that oliver stone had written this i was not the least bit surprised that is a testament to him though i have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with scarface nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than oliver stone the music was good but not that great it is certainly not my favorite from giorgio moroder the music was a little bit too 80s ish for me but it didn t annoy me the cinematography was good not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this this has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons people should realize that the character of tony montana is no hero he is a monster he is not inspiring in anyway he is greedy bloodthirsty uneducated and self consumed yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster a vigilante would be like mother tereasa next to scarface the good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the tony montanas are not the real problem if we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don t in a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society he is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it the tony montanas of this world are the scapegoats of our society this in no way excuses people like him instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn t excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer i love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect 
__label__1 only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie superior ancients that dwell in the lands of lore far beyond any average human creature s understanding this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical force of fantasy unto thee mystical crystals of chalice stories come and go but the idea for a good story is to think positive not negative thoughts to create a good versus evil battle like never before embracing an impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other striking a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world 
__label__1 i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience as we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human s place in nature and technology s effect upon man s relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made tent there is also city man s disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker the fact that the banker from atlanta ned beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized man s suppositives about the law this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters 
__label__1 this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down 
__label__1 watched both parts twice enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the lady in distress alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces she didn t have the look of the woman of the 1800 s the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older age is inevitable but let s not hide from it a man at 50 can be much sexier and patrick truly is sexy then a green youth no matter how pretty hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile 
__label__0 i wasn t entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought i d give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story won t give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didn t turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely :)
__label__0 note to all mad scientists everywhere if you re going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i don t care if he s a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha get a load of this paul the monster is ripping me to shreds that s the worst part about this movie is this shark thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there aren t other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but that s a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie 
__label__1 joe buck jon voight decides he s going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building there isn t much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck s plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybody s talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won t and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratso s reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser 
__label__1 white fire has so much going for it with larry bird look alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache the movie soars above other low budget actioners the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz with ginty beating up everyone the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play then add in fred williamson some frontal bush chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders if you re looking for some awesome b action this is where it s at now if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack 
__label__0 a study in bad bad acting bad music bad screenplay bad editing bad direction and a bad idea pieces of schlock don t come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this thing by the end of the movie you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place poor malcolm mcdowell was he short of cash or something still thinking of seeing this spoilers ahoy if you haven t died of laughter in the first thirty minutes by the time you ll see the cyborg populated town named cytown you will avoid this my movie loving friends avoid 
__label__1 what a delightful film accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman s lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year incredible casting gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as harriett smith the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter hind of pork pork mother she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother mrs bates played by emma thompson s mother phyllida law who looks forlorn and lost the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one s heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over over the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life s greatest lessons about how one should marry one s best friend i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself i adored it 
__label__1 i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me alas i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by kalifornia upon watching again recently i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago there are two things which really give this movie its power the first is its cast we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace knowing pitt as we all do as one of the most enduring heart throbs hollywood has ever had it is refreshing to see him play such a vile unattractive character pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white trash cliché or parody and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie juliette lewis is equally impressive as grace s tragic girlfriend playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old s life experience lewis manages to evoke pity for her character s station in life as well as contempt for her naivety but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young personally i think it s a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis duchovony is aptly geeky and naive and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut off but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters changes as they are equally intrigued repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing at the time kalifornia was released hollywood was releasing a slew of nice character turns out to be psychotic movies single white female pacific heights the hand that rocks the cradle deceived sleeping with the enemy etc most of these movies followed the same formula the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy kalifornia doesn t really stray too far from this territory but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow boil thriller and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn when the penny does drop and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don t quite live up to rest of the movie that said the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold the fight is over but the scars will always be there much of the narration provided by a somewhat whiny pre x files duchovony is a tad contrived of course it s meant to be from the book the duchovony s journalist character has written so one could argue that the self conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90 of the thrillers of the past twenty years highly recommended but not for the weak of stomach or mind this film is disturbing on more than one level but then it s meant to be 
__label__1 the power of kangwon province is director hong sang soo s second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film including the multiple connected narratives in this case two and stories of troubled or troubling relationships as well as a potent dosage of irony one thing that s clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism however this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends only to find herself drawn to a stranger the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes again hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i don t think he s entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony i think the think i ve come to love about hong s films is that they just feel so real especially the complex and conflicted characters not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings but rather that these characters he and the actors present feel fully developed and believable this is not a fast moving film there s a lot of lingering and like the previous film things don t always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways there doesn t appear to be any element of the film that isn t intentionally placed in the film and it s made my a little hyper aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion regret longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision making it s a rather hard balance to keep and it s surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear this film doesn t pack the same emotional wallop that the first does but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision great viewing for art cinema lovers 8 10 
__label__1 there aren t many overcoming the odds stories quite like that of christy brown born with cerebral palsy in 1930s dublin his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical though eventually properly diagnosed brown in a lower working class family with nearly 20 children had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family through the use of his only fully functioning limb his left leg he taught himself to write and paint both skills he developed expertly but what makes the film version of brown s autobiography my left foot such a great retelling is its humility both director writer jim sheridan and star daniel day lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn t scream for attention and resort to melodrama cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous yet my left foot stays real and intrinsically inspired day lewis is the easiest to highlight playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task not only does day lewis give us a very complete picture of christy but he also manages to chronicle the growth improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life he plays christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned christy who struggles to cope with why he can t find non platonic love the latter theme is the film s strongest and it would ve been nice for sheridan and co adapter shane connaughton to really flesh that out regardless day lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements giving a performance that s so believable you often don t have time to think wow he s such a great actor those are the most commendable performances equally important but through more subtle means is sheridan s work on the film this story is about day to day life and struggles although christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life his struggles are not unlike our own and sheridan grasps that concept completely christy struggles with love parental attention questions of self worth and capability his struggles are just more physically manifested literally and figuratively than ours sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large brown family and christy s unique place in it the drama evolves naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way the dinner scene when christy learns that his doctor teacher the woman he loves is going to marry his brother peter is the film s finest example of both day lewis and sheridan s efforts it s built up to so well by sheridan that it comes out when we re ready and day lewis takes us from there with his stunning work the other strong component of the film is brenda fricker as mrs brown i did not know she d won the oscar but there was something about her performances as christy s loving and wise mother that just screamed oscar worthy her love for christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situation the emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human the two should be reconcilable but i imagine it s challenging to tell a story that feels true to life and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster the choice to downplay the latter was definitely the wise one for my left foot brown s circumstances speak for themselves they don t need to be squeezed for weightier dramatic impact steven cvisit my site moviemusereviews com for more
__label__1 for the record i am not affiliated with the production in any way hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date over 7 seasons this is the last they have produced some 50 or so episodes this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy by their own admission the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects green screen work and acting all improve i did find it difficult to dip into so started from the beginning and watched all the way through hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set characters and relatives from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories sometimes improving on the characters over the original the whole experience includes an excellent web site blooper reels a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat if you are looking for high definition high budget productions this is probably not for you if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think this is the one

__label__1 had this movie been made just a few years later i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor at times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in between scenes normal ambient sounds are missing but given it was 1931 and a french movie this is quite forgivable especially since this also occurs in later french films by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely such as in l atalante from 1934 okay apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it and during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can t help but like a nice charming film all in all 
__label__1 this movie maked me cry at the end i watch at least 3 4 movies a week i seen loads of great movies even more crap ones but when ending scene catharsic at it s core came i cried and if you didn t you have serious problems the story is archetypal nothing new or original but it s real because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist glam isn t my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70 s at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine docudramas never really work very good but this movie really meked us believe it all because they don t try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts present musicians that are superheroes groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb they don t glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late once again great movie since leaving las vegas i was never so moved by a movie 
__label__1 john carpenter s halloweenis it the greatest horror film of all time no maybe not to everyone but to me it is and always will be the film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart it s unfortunate i didn t get to see this film until twenty years after it s release but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then my father suggested before i go see halloween h20 that i whip out and rent halloween s 1 and 2 to get the full story and after watching halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the slasher genre the film s plot is simple in 1963 michael audrey myers killed his sister judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by dr sam loomis he escapes and returns to his hometown of haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls laurie strode an innocent bookworm annie brackett a tough talking sarcastic and lynda van der klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl dr loomis tracks michael here where he enlists the help of the town sheriff leigh brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one until only sweet innocent laurie is left who is the prime target on michael s list the casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances jamie lee curtis was stunning in her first film role as laurie strode and donald pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as loomis nick castle who portrays michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer and his walk and body movements were perfect one of the great highlights of this film is it s chilling score done by john carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today the blue lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends and in the shadows behind her michael s face materializes before he strikes michael s mask was one of the thing s that sent chills down my spine the most the white emotionless face worked perfectly what makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy friday the 13th films in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension it became so clear that halloween spawned movies like friday the 13th and characters like jason voorhees whom he is a mere rip off of michael myers to sum it up i suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time

__label__1 recently i was looking for the newly issued wide screen dvd of fly away home and came upon interesting title that i had never heard of grey owl the fact that it was a richard attenborough film caught my attention he responsible for such fine films as gandhi chaplin and shadowlands i noticed that the screenplay was by william nicholson author of shadowlands this special edition was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under 10 00 so i chanced it bought it wow what a beautiful film pierce brosnan stars as archie grey owl a real life trapper in the 1930s who came to love and respect the wild lands of canada and worked to help protect them brosnan who starred in a james bond film gives a shaded warm powerful performance as does annie galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land especially the beaver a fine score by george fenton the crucible and beautiful photograhy by roger pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film and the extras on this dvd are something else includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real grey owl as well as audio commentary tracks by attenborough and producer jake eberts 2 featurettes and many other fine additions plus options for those having access to a pc with dvd rom features grey owl has been released directly to dvd in the united states a fact that richard attenborough attributes to hollywood s lack of interest in distributing something that isn t loaded with a lot of violence and sex this is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about i had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion and a whole new love and understanding for beavers grey owl is a very fine film worth checking out this is one i look forward to sharing with others

__label__0 my take a tired formula christmas comedy the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too i love the holidays as much as the next guy even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues but it seems it s just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year but that doesn t make them any less painful during the season as if we already had enough santa clause movies three and gulp still counting who wants to see a movie about his brother in a plot that would be at home with disney s santa clause franchise save the occasionally crude humor and santa s little helper wearing a short skirt fred claus is a one joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes sure jolly ol saint nick has a brother but where does it go from there it s a shame really fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow but it would have been so much better than this vince vaughn is your typical snob but we are led to believe he s really the long lost brother of the never aging santa paul giamatti who invites his good ol brother to visit mrs claus miranda richardson is reluctant and worse an efficiency expert kevin spacey has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas and his this close to being shut down hah and guess who plays santa s mother kathy bates of course elizabeth banks is santa s helper charlene john michael higgins is one of the elves and rachel wiesz plays fred s girlfriend si don t know if i d praise the casting or to bash it here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality but they re given way too little to work with as for humor the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa s brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers where he is joined by stephen baldwin roger clinton and frank stallone but the giggles begin and end there worse still the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that s supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what christmas really means apparently what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can rating out of 5

__label__0 wow after trashing the disk of timo roses rout city after about 15 minutes south park is about more than meaningless cursing i guess some people just don t get it i was interested in this movie i read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash i expected after rout city surprise the movie isn t total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that timo rose tries to walk in the footsteps of german horror splatter cinema like olaf ittenbach and the likes that means barricade is in parts extremely gory and detailed the gore fx are not really believable but ok the acting is ok but in some cases plain sucks the hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn t get better till she s shot so what is the problem the movie is gory has a typical german underground vibe including the classic booby shots in blood ok fx and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised 1 the script is total bs you get a typical hillbilly lost in the woods story with some guys gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family everything is just leading towards the torture mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless this is the first thing that makes barricade half hearted 2 random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work i liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store even worse the editing sure its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its random you got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning its just there all the time then there s some grainy noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it i don t get the meaning 3 like the fore mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here for example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching its ok once but here its annoying and fake especially towards the end annoying also attributes the music which is permanently used without any change in the background it doesn t take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable 4 from all this comes the biggest problem of this movie and many others in my opinion if you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special fx and new school editing it looks like they take it way too serious its no fun because the decent gore fx are plain wasted in this context and where the classic gore fx are ok the computer fx in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly and 3d splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3d artists i often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and barricade is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb its no fun has no character and is too trashy for its look the script is a cheap try on wrong turn and tcm leading absolutely nowhere you can take that literally the ending is just there and as random as many other things here i love you in a splatter flick come on barricade tries to incorporate a lot and fails you can sure fast forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment acid face melting nipple pinching and classic friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent bloody boobies hooray but its really hard to get through this total failure especially because you can see it could have been something

__label__1 this movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art what strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed besides following the play like a tv broadcast there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games this brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory today s tv broadcasting style so different than that of 1986 is still inferior in quality compared to this movie the players are not the only stars the audience the referees the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history in this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way in that regard today s tv broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality although it is now much closer than before there are several highlighted players maradona argentina elkjaer and laudrup denmark francescoli uruguay platini france lineker england rummenigge germany butrague o spain socrates brazil and sanchez mexico this movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of mexico 1986 although most of them are well covered across all the movie there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique because of what happened because of referees during mexico 1986 much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely maradona biased much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen that they are as human as the players and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other soccer rules do not allow referees to use tv based replays to make decisions so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive as a consequence referees play an active part in the development of a game their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie the sequel movie for the 1990 world cup compared to this one is just a source of bitter disappointment much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game whereas this movie tells things from a more distant unbiased point of view

__label__0 except people apparently buy into this garbage as shows like moral orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over the top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldn t come close to the hilarity of this show it s hard to tell what s even going on when you re watching it is it a news show a talk show who knows they start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy pat robertson doesn t even seem like such a bad guy at first glance he just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs like most of our grandparents but this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but two murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has supported forced abortions in china and who regularly implies that caucasians straight american male caucasians in particular are superior to all other races still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later either that or enough money to bribe some tv executives who don t give a damn what they show the idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word even when robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him i don t know if it s funny or scary i guess a healthy mixture of both 
__label__1 this movie is of almost generation defining importance to some of us born in the early post war years in that and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house you almost certainly saw it and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you it s style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days it had a modern space age storyboard for the audiences of it s time the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show it has hot rods and rebellious youth but in the why can t they let us have fun way rather than the disturbed histrionic rebel without a cause way all characters were identifiable to us teens parents the old man the doctor the nurse the mechanic the boy the puppy even the cops were sympathetic to us we could relate to them allit had a singularly horrifying monster it s first victim is heard moaning it hurts it hurts and we were convinced and frightened the menace grows continually throughout the story there are intense periods of suspense colourful effects a fabulous lead in mcqueen and moments of humour both intended and not it even had an almost over the top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying i saw it in summer age 9 or so double billed with i married a monster from outer space and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left everyone i knew saw it everyone i knew loved it 
__label__0 this film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy it is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy the fortunes of the well meaning yet pathetic character tom oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another the only saving graces are the competent performance by toni collete and the frequency with which we glimpse paltrow s pleasant face overall to be avoided 
__label__1 all dogs go to heaven is the most cutest animated film to have dogs in 1989 the previous don bluth film the land before time 1988 became a success dogs are so cute as little mice aw i just want to hug them when they re cute where was i oh yes its animation is beautiful the characters are great when they re perfectly voiced and the songs are cute and touching it opened in november 17 1989 the same date as the little mermaid produced by walt disney feature animation the part where charlie got killed by carface was so unforgivable carface is so mean because he wanted to kill charlie shame on him the love survive song performed by irene cara and freddie jackson was so beautiful all dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever 
__label__1 while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching lost i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1 the one with the polar bear and it has had my undivided attention ever since the show that is not the polar bear so bear heh with me while i throw out as much rambling semi coherent praise as i can muster lost takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchingly what drives them who are they where did they come from it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives whether they re running away from something sawyer and kate among others or getting in touch with spirituality locke claire but lost also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses and they all seem to be strangely connected while television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities most of the cast of lost are in truth spectacular actors for their respective parts projecting heart and humour in their performances there s also a multitude of eyecandy but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness petty arguments or cheesy melodrama although they are annoyingly secretive these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action the realism of these characters facilitate an already well sculptured plot about this plot imagine a tree as the template plot then the branches as subplots in this case one branch for every character well lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines if you re a brother sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks you will get your own storyline if you re a dog you will have your own storyline unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end they are setting themselves up i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop out to this show as i m sure most people are but assuming the writers do pull this off lost is possibly the best show ever to hit television 9 10
__label__0 to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop it under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealistic overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe pelts i don t know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand 
__label__0 it s very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera it s unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad e g chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score 0 02 out of 10 
__label__0 in the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments i d like to offer some advice free of charge from a viewer s perspective if you want to make a serious exotic adventure film do it if you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films go ahead do not try to make both at the same time it doesn t work for example having a goofy comic relief character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal s head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make this one is boring meandering cheap racist you get the picture a couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from kathy shower way too prissy here are hardly worth your trouble there is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film s existence 1 2 
__label__0 there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be we often see films which we describe as pretty awful or not much good but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren t good they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation i e to give me a present it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn t this is so utterly clichéd so badly written so poorly directed so badly acted that i m surprised everyone involved hasn t been arrested and sent down for 10 years god it s awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes sometimes bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isn t one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin 
__label__0 i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80 s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday 13th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don t spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory 
__label__0 this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it this movie was not just bad as in low budget badly acted etc although it certainly was all of those things the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and doing it with great success what i want to know is is this supposed to be a horror movie i mean it s definately horrifying but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing but what the hell is the second segment it s just annoying the third segment is like watching an artsy student film which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment it s an atrocity that this movie isn t way low on the bottom 100 so get your votes 1 10 in people i know some people gave this good reviews but well they re lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you trust me it is impossible to like this movie the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life extending effect it feels like you ve been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed 
__label__1 in my mind this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period this series paid homage to both the superman films of the 70s 80s and the superman comics series reboot of 1986 onward man of steel superman vol 2 action comics adventures of superman etc the opening score and titles were stirring based on the john williams score from the films updated for a saturday morning action series marv wolfman one of the main contributors to the comics reboot writer of adventures of superman was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series overall the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid friendly superman was presented as believable strong and iconic his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniac ceo incarnation the daily planet characters lois jimmy and perry were portrayed well one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira paradise island both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era and it seemed like an equally well done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same the one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd blu ray it deserves to be 
__label__1 loved joan great performance what isn t she good in i watched this film and then jane eyre right after she just keeps getting better my heart was racing great old movie drama just what i want from a classic movie facial expressions are worth the whole film i m glad i have it on video don t know what more you need in a film beautiful woman wealth greed murder detectives a trial the costumes are very nice makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie wish they still made films like this whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie films in black and white still hold a certain mystery 
__label__0 i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don t watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgic i didn t like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film 
__label__1 i just purchased and viewed the dvd of this film the dvd transfer is from last year 2001 this 1988 film is really a great little film overlooked by most people i saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since i love the opening shot of pittsburgh not baltimore as another user commented makes pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world and i must say the tour of pitts on the garbage truck with nicky is a very scenic interesting one tom hulce as everyone else has said gives a remarkable wonderful performance the dvd is a good transfer with no extras but a widescreen format i recommend it to those who love the movie 
__label__1 this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do the acting was the best farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful there aren t many movies that have riveted me as this one the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re lived her horror as she went through it farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene 
__label__0 those familiar with the two previous cube films pretty much know what they can expect a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms paranoia bad acting this one is a bit different though roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube or at least five of them i guess cube zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is but you really don t get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films sure there s sort of an explanation in there but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film cube zero looks rather cheap as did its predecessors and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling i also fell pretty confident in saying that there s no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future they have brought back the traps from cube 1 though by that i mean that they re almost the same ones which is a bit of a shame i know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one but i just feel that it s a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn t that great to begin with 1 10 
__label__0 i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why can t you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild 
__label__1 there s an inexhaustible hunger for basic training movies so it s surprising that this one got so little notice when first released looks likely to have a well deserved second life on dvd vhs tigerland isn t uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portrayal of the nco s makes you long for the return of lee full metal jacket ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get 
__label__0 this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored so called scares that are about as shocking as peewee s playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice krige s character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landis are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie 
__label__0 i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt the opening moments with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter diana about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art give the impression that this could be a kick ass artsy vampire flick turns out this initial impression turns out false oh troma the mark of some kind of lack of quality sometimes they ll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk food craft or sometimes not this is a case where it s not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor i e the protagonist s father is an old vaudevillian who does jimmy durante impressions are weak at best and any unintentional laughs are undercut by sergio lapel s bargain basement direction and it s not without him trying oh lord no he does try a lot which is a big part of the problem he and his producers had money for lights sure but the way they re used in the movie made i a former student filmmaker and aspiring director sulking in my seat if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances and would wonder whether or not his dp understood really the basic 3 point lighting set up while this along with a very lackluster sound design or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene shouldn t be something that comes to attention during a troma release it should be something basic that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn t very funny or scary and it isn t or if lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments it s not a good movie by any stretch and perhaps if you re a vampire die hard or just a vampire period it might have some appeal as a low rent bargain basement alternative to near dark or as a slight improvement over say 1972 s blood freak you have better ways to waste your time overall 
__label__0 miscasting happens susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be 35 white haired george c scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80 jane s deceased uncle is in better shape he creaks and snarls obnoxious and grim he looks like an ax murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened we re not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic the great love story looks like a sado masochistic nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but bronte s rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle 
__label__0 this is one of the very worst films clark gable made only parnell was obviously worse it is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going to the slammer like the gangster talk she holds out hope that he ll do the right thing but he just leaves her there unknown to either of them gosh that she s in the family way eventually the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending they seemed to have forgotten about gable s needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow leonard maltin says the stars are at their best here by what standard best at producing unintended chuckles gimme a break ps after saying this my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt hmmm however despite my comment i think mr maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet i hope that appeased him update 2 2 08 because i disliked this film so much the first time especially the ridiculous ending i decided to watch it once again after all sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh while that has been the case with several films in recent months i still disliked this film even the second time most of it was not because of the first half of the film in the first half harlow s character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable but when she was sent to prison it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons i stand by my original review despite all the not helpfuls and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus it might just be the worst gable film 
__label__1 here is one the entire family will enjoy even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales shelley duvall outdid herself with this unique imaginative take on nearly all of the popular fairy tales of childhood the scripts offer new twists on the age old fables we grew up on and they feature a handful of stars in each episode cinderella is no exception to duvall s standard and in my opinion it s one of the top five of the series highlighted by jennifer beals remember her from flashdance and she s still in hollywood today making a movie here and there in the title role jean stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and eve arden as the embodiment of wicked stepmotherhood edie mcclurg ferris bueller s day off and jane alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepsisters matthew broderick is an affable prince henry you ll all keep coming back for this one

__label__1 this movie took the jerry springer approach to super human power wilder napalm is the kind of theme based movie that i love addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them at the same time the movie points out that every prodigy is only human and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being this was a great comedy fun and human with that slight satiric edge 
__label__0 when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated on a per capita basis europe britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per capta basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society by doing so greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash sensationalism at its worst anti usa garbage shameful 
__label__1 this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people not white black etc good movie with a good message 
__label__1 the gangster genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in it s genre thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it s content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance humor and unvarnished violence the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew however tony is of two persona s one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series but i won t if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital ambiguous unrelenting epic uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you 
__label__0 this movie was like a bad indie with a list talent the plot was silly all the way to the end it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980 s i would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile i think the worst thing was the underwater scene s held off of the dock the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear i would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf good day 
__label__1 i am not going to spoil the contents to anyone who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by kay pollak a world famous conductor brilliantly played by michael nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village the villagers who has followed the genius in silence are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness each role in this movie has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words a symphony of love not love in the sense of relationship but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters each revealing their own present story their needs their skeletons desires and much more i shall not forget to mention the two main parts played by frida hallgren and michael nyqvist whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback they touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves michael nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic and fantastic it became from start to end not one second less or more than enough you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more to this day definitely one of the best movies i have had the pleasure of watching 
__label__1 this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought being a history teacher i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film the movie begins with 12 year old carol and her mother returning to her mother s home town years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city despite the strangeness carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts as for why her and her mother are alone i ll spill it now for those who don t pick up on the fact that carol s father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music the rather slow and rambling pace isn t bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them not better or worse just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick ps if you don t know which side is which the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries including the usa the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy 
__label__1 legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children with an a list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman an oscar worthy performance here ethan hawke marisa tomei and albert finney lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as reservoir dogs but also family stories such as ordinary people many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here instead of showing it in a linear manner he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei as well as between father and son finney and hoffman all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn t delve in plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time this is a rare movie that doesn t disappoint for one moment 
__label__1 if you get it it s magnificent if you don t it s decent please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean you ve gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificant above all it s a movie about acceptance both superficially of a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reason it s also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between alicia s rage and deanna s obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic ending above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed but that is not necessarily a bad thing 
__label__0 wow why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be hpd2 has no clue of what it wants to be it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain spoiler the whole movie is this twitch played by kurupt of tha dogg pound gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried in the jail a riot breaks out between rival inmates one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape during a conjugal visit twitch s fiancée and burke s played by bill goldberg daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones opinion this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier the return the script is terrible the acting is horrendous the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature look i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do nobody in this movie believes in the characters they play nobody in this movie can be taken seriously as an actor kurupt should be ashamed of himself his character twitch is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phd pretty huge dump the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpd2 is pretty boring even when action is happening don t let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood 
__label__1 i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i m a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn t believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking puke isn t really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackass s league 
__label__0 i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i don t believe there is a worse movie in the world i hate this movie i hate the acting dialog setting writing and directing i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell damn this disgusting waste of time i pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination i pray that i dreamt the movie and that i will never have to see it at my local video store again burn in hell
__label__1 let me start by saying that war inc is not everyone s cup of tea it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking oh crap the comedy involved the film isn t obvious at all it s quite subtle tamerlane tanks dry cleaning service etc and it changes with the twists turns in the plot i may be the only one but i won t compare this with grosse point blank because it s different john cusack i wouldn t say he was amazing or brilliant but he was good on the other hand his sister joan cusack was incredible in her delivery of lines comedic timing even though she was hardly in the film i d say the same about ben kingsley marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to pull it off hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah duff s development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job even though her accent is a tad unreal overall the film is what i would call entertaining it doesn t have a particular storyline and it s quite silly at times but it does have a subtle message i d say it s worth a watch 
__label__0 once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling science fiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era and then it happened 1997 countless awards obscene amounts of money outlandish barrage of advertising maximum profit margin titanic was here i have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout quickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills 90210 the acting was more wooden than my nephew s tree house images meant to terrify were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false don t even get me started because there s too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not it was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boy with car chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sex starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick flick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money i d do it if i had those kind of chances in life it is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically false human interest tripe like the patriot and pearl harbor 
__label__1 very sweet pilot the show reeks of tim burton s better films edward sissorhands big fish charlie the chocolate factory the cinematography the narration the music the external sets all scream tim burton there has to be a connection or a strong influence i just haven t researched enough to know where it is as i ve seen in the forums yes anna friel is playing a poor man s zooey deschanel every time i see her on the screen i see zooey don t get me wrong anna friel does a great job her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her it s more of a distraction that i keep thinking why didn t they get zooey deschanel lee pace does a great job too i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up wonderfalls great short lived series from 2004 if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent wonderfalls which is another brian fuller creation hmmmm loved seeing swoosie kurtz world according to garp and ellen greene little shop of horrors again two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances 
__label__0 disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn t make at least two sequels about and this one was no exception to the people at disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward somehow although i did not pay to view it i feel cheapened by watching it ariel is grown up now and had a daughter yet doesn t allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased sea witch so here we go again the daughter is tricked of course and helps the sea witch after a not so glorious battle she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony yawn there is nothing to view here go back to your lives d 
__label__1 as a baseball die hard this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie authentic looking sports action believable characters and an original story line while angels in the outfield fails miserably in the first category it succeeds beautifully in the latter two angels weaves the story of roger and j p two anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family with that of the woebegone angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games pushed by his deadbeat father s promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise s downward spiral and when short fused manager george knox portrayed by danny glover begins believing in what roger sees the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around and roger and j p find something to believe in glover in particular gives a nice performance and tony danza playing a washed up pitcher also does well despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the windup 
__label__0 for the initial 20 minutes or so i was watching it on a ps2 so i ve really no idea how long it took alienator sets up an interesting premise i don t think i ve seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before however interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the alien is a huge body builder woman in a steel bikini yes alienator is patently ridiculous don t think i hold that against it in the world of shlock horror patently ridiculous can often be a good sign however the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it alienator is funny as hell but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set pieces by the time the movie s finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on it add to this the fact that the alien just kills people by vaporising them as opposed to doing any slashing as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot you ll laugh at alienator but at it not with it if that s your thing then go ahead and check it out 
__label__1 i really can t remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one like rubbernecking at a highway accident someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really can t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton s in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you couldn t help but think how bad was it before it s a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating 
__label__1 from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the penguins i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it played by bertille noel beuneau the story s frankly quite simple and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust and how they go about hanging around each other dealing with respective adversaries and the likes here the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains which provide for plenty of beautiful picture postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture but while we indulge in wistful scenery the characters don t get to establish that level of trust from the onset and we have to wait a few seasons to past and 45 minutes into the film before they find a leveler in food the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement but the fox well as other notions of course while i thought the narrative was pretty weak unlike march of the penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what s happening on screen what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator and a prey between the two more tension and drama was given to the latter especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves and granted those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it otherwise it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren t really quite suitable for children as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly so parents you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers as a film i would ve preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguins but i guess the way it was resented probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature and that some things are just not meant to be and should stay as such decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel bruneau and the multiple foxes that played renard 
__label__1 kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants on the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life i don t think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirelli s romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the mayhem this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages 
__label__1 i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for it or if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the show i enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty sànchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respect this is a show that has little taste or class it s not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out now these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character 
__label__0 how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it s terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it s so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create 
__label__0 and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing the acting and sound is awful this might qualify for a so bad it s good point of merit for some however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap it s just soooo cheap i think that s my major complaint the dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times you startled me is used the child actress is seriously god awful i pray her acting career ended here her line donuts i hate donuts is worth repeated viewing however 
__label__1 soap opera about a small town married woman kay francis who works at the local newsstand performs as leading lady in her local playhouse but dreams of becoming a star on broadway when a famous actor who is a ham a windbag and a womanizer to boot arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom he pretends his valet is his manager tricking her into believing she has all it takes but experience to become a big star her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor s unexpected death which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected a life prison sentence for hubby next thing you know she s joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man s freedom all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk this film has a pretty interesting plot well a bit far fetched perhaps but very melodramatic with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it all greatly enhanced by the strong emotional performance given by kay francis she just makes this film also helping here is the well done acting by minna gombell in her role as a getting close to forty older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay worth seeing especially for kay francis fans 
__label__1 the first time i saw this i didn t laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because felix s aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes weren t as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of oscar s antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didn t make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack klugman and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television 7 out of 10 
__label__0 in over 70 years of watching movies this has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made mel brooks mike meyers a few other have made some very bad comedies this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel it is unfunny from the very opening to the tacked on scene during the credits diane keaton who i normally like must have needed her paycheck badly she desperately needs to re learn her craft dax shepard i do not know who he is needs a better director to show him how to act liv tyler is also not up to her role mike white needs to find another character he has done this same type person a few times too many ken howard who started out years back as a first rate actor also not as good as he used to be there is nothing decent i can say on this attempt at movie comedy ratings out of 4 points 25 out of 100 imdb 1 out of 10 
__label__1 i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not i m glad i gave it a chance bait ain t perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i don t know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell he s working on instinct and instinct doesn t fail him the plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and there s even a character arc through which foxx s character grows as a person again they could ve slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better i m surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but i d give it a 7 10 bravo mssr foxx 
__label__1 at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen apart from that is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen while watching the movie and even upon post contemplation it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that performances every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives even so apart from that does not feel like a documentary or reality television but instead transcends into a category of its own with its unique cinematography and direction i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walker this movie must be seen

__label__0  ask the dust looked intriguing from the trailer and we especially like all of the actors unfortunately the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama and it wasn t funny enough to be a comedy it practically seemed to satirize itself and to no entertaining effect after seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better my wife and i walked out valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense it simply was not interesting moving funny nor artistic it appears as though it were written produced and directed by a high school kid worse yet it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors not to mention our time and money 
__label__0 i have never read the book a wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldn t be reviewing this movie i ll start off with that next i ll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlin how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i ll just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodard or woodward i am not sure the oscar winner the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go wtf what did i expect it s a tv movie they usually aren t good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off you ll most likely forget about it the second it s over well maybe not the second it s over but within a few minutes a wrinkle in time 
__label__1 this is a script that ed wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made aris iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other more transitory valuables this is a dialogue free movie that some may foolishly describe as silent in fact it is a quite noisy film without the inane chatter of most flicks in the hands of these filmmakers the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the hollywood script mill particularly that stupid boat movie billy zane last was in watch out oh no j cameron ick i ll take zane s wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day billy zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film ricci is radiant as always and the gods are shining when you can put sandra bernhard rick y schroeder eartha kitt and andrew mccarthy s name on the same poster the design is perfect the pyramid set exquisite and ron perlman s beastly performance is simply wonderful overall this is a chaotic visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ed wood jr auteur and cinenephile a must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate iliopulos and his cast obviously do a film to make you wish you had made it yourself 
__label__1 didn t mystic pizza win the oscar for that year this movie never had a chance due to the casting but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater only wargames left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future history has shown that this is exactly what happened the casting is a pop culture cuisinart of the 1980s you get arnold as ben richards the framed fugitive offered a chance to run for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie richard dawson as damon killian treating his role as if he were the host of family feud with the contestants using real guns jesse ventura as captain freedom and co wrestler professor tanaka as subzero both stalkers who kill the running men even mick fleetwood mic and dweezil zappa stevie show up while the dancers of the future are none other than the laker girls this movie screams 80s the plot is a good excuse for the action ben richards is determined to prove his innocence but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free instead they join him as contestants maria conchita alonzo as amber mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s the production value on the film was a bit poor the lines were cheesy and at the time the plot seemed a bit far fetched i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film but who could have seen how far we d go there and how fast if the running man were listed in tv guide most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today the government influences on the media have only gotten worse and the dumbed down american public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for national security is downright chilling ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience the movie was way over the top maybe even off the cliff for its time but as with back to the future iii the ravine it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time it is tragic that as with wargames the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved serious actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars but that doesn t make them better films than their common man counterparts such as this one an absolute must see 
__label__1 this is a film that everyone should watch quite apart from raising hugely important points while south africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now it is superbly directed while denzel washington gives in my opinion the best performance in his career so far kline also gives a good performance although perhaps not as stunning as washington s john thaw also puts in a good turn as the chief of police there are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down but all of these have been avoided it would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys but attenborough has not done this sure there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil such as the captain at the soweto uprising but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long some people complain about the length of the film as it is but i think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story for it really is an incredible one the best scene in the film is that of steve biko s funeral when the whole crowd begins to sing the south african national anthem it is probably one of if not the most moving scenes i have seen if you haven t seen this film already watch it it may not be comfortable viewing but it s certainly worth it 
__label__1 i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 the final episode of the 10th season unending where it would certainly appear that the asgard have been killed off in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief from the extremely rushed end of the series it s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg 1 franchise for the two upcoming direct to dvd moves unless the asgard return in a future sg 1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean up of loose ends poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci fi series 
__label__0 this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence in which brian flemming perhaps purposely fails to mention important evidence to the contrary perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest his claims concerning the invalidity of paul s testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts like the existence of some formulated creeds within paul s letters these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christ s death and resurrection the testimonies of the early christians can t just be tossed out as mere fantasy there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period but only one of them has remained jesus why because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected even if the gospels are dated more liberally we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier what i am saying is that flemming s documentary is an incredibly biased and self serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti christian view don t be fooled by poor investigation 
__label__1  the adventures of barry mckenzie started life as a satirical comic strip in private eye written by barry humphries and based on an idea by peter cook mckenzie bazza to his friends is a lanky loud hat wearing australian whose two main interests in life are sex despite never having had any and fosters lager in 1972 he found his way to the big screen for the first of two outings it must have been tempting for humphries to cast himself as bazza but he wisely left the job to barry crocker later to sing the theme to the television soap opera neighbours humphries instead played multiple roles in true peter sellers fashion most notably bazza s overbearing aunt edna everage this was before she became a dame you know this is not going to be the importance of being ernest when its censorship classification n p a stands for no poofters allowed pom hating bazza is told by a sydney solicitor that in order to inherit a share in his father s will he must go to england to absorb british culture with aunt edna in tow he catches a quantas flight to hong kong and then on to london an over efficient customs officer makes bazza pay import duties on everything he bought over there including a suitcase full of tubes of fosters lager as he puts it when it comes to fleecing you the poms have got the edge on the gyppos a crafty taxi driver bernard spear maximises the fare by taking bazza and edna first to stonehenge then scotland the streets of london are filthy and their hotel is a hovel run by a seedy landlord spike milligan who makes bazza put pound notes in the electricity meter every twenty minutes there is some good news for our hero though he meets up with other aussies in earls court and fosters is on sale in british pubs what happens next is a series of comical escapades that take bazza from starring in his own cigarette commercial putting curry down his pants in the belief it is some form of aphrodisiac a bizarre encounter with dennis price as an upper class pervert who loves being spanked while wearing a schoolboy s uniform a young conservative dance in rickmansworth to a charity rock concert where his song about chundering vomiting almost makes him an international star and finally to the b b c t v centre where he pulls his pants down on a live talk show hosted by the thinking man s crumpet herself joan bakewell a fire breaks out and bazza s friends come to the rescue downing cans of fosters they urinate on the flames en masse this is a far cry from bruce beresford s later works breaker morant and driving miss daisy on release it was savaged by critics for being too vulgar well yes it is but it is also great non p c fun bazza is a disgusting creation but his zest for life is unmistakable you cannot help but like the guy his various euphemisms for urinating point percy at the porcelain and vomiting the technicolour yawn have passed into the english language without a lot of people knowing where they came from other guest stars include dick bentley as a detective who chases bazza everywhere peter cook julie covington later to star in rock follies and even future arts presenter russell davies a sequel the wonderfully named barry mckenzie holds his own came out two years later at its premiere humphries took the opportunity to blast the critics who had savaged the first film good for him what must have been of greater concern to him though was the release of crocodile dundee in 1985 it also featured a lanky hat wearing aussie struggling to come to terms with a foreign culture and made tonnes more money the song on the end credits performed by snacka fitzgibbon is magnificent you have a love a lyric that includes the line if you want to send your sister in a frenzy introduce her to barry mckenzie time to end this review i have to go the dunny to shake hands with the unemployed 
__label__0 as i am not a blood and guts fan i found the gory scenes totally unnecessary you spell it and too real for my liking if you re the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies i say go for it it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie the music was top class too through the movie and especially the end credits some parts though were a bit unbelievable like you ve just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there why didn t he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it come on now most would probably just scream hurry up and untie me then lets get the f out of here quick where were the flys maggots etc and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells i would only recommend this movie to friends of dennis niellson and the like i m sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy christmas 
__label__0 i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i d seen burning moon but while that movie was rather grim and nasty premutos seems to mostly play it for laughs while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this i found myself constantly battling not to fast forward to the next gore scene sure there s gore and if that s all you want then go ahead and enjoy but be warned there s an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition many are comparing this to peter jackson s movies especially braindead but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in bad taste it s clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has talent 3 10 for pretty good and plentiful gore effects and for getting the most out of limited resources but not worth the money i paid for it 
__label__1 if you know the story of grey owl you ll love the movie annie galipeau is a great actress and pierce is better than never in grey owl but in this movie there s no real scene of action i think this movie should be nominated at the oscars welll go see this movie it s a classic 
__label__1 all the talent mr sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad but i have to say it wasn t an accident this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant right from the first scene it affects you the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic so is anupam kher but its a shahid amrita film amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film hats off to mr sooraj barjatya 
__label__1 there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the best the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law rationing does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that s where the moral comes in it s when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food lot s of it thus enabling them to continue their struggle this film hit s the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley holloway margaret rutherford hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out it s pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing
__label__1 you ll probably never see it but the uncut version is about 50 better than the one you can buy put it another way once you ve seen it in its original form the current version is only half as good it s still wildly creative and sick a total success on so many levels 
__label__1 i like ghost stories good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained now i ve see many of them as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films i ever saw it was on once in 1972 i was only 9 but nothing since then even compared to it with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special efx than the original this episode was down right creepy as hell i m lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original the haunting and george c scott in the changling wish someone would do more ghost stories like these 
__label__1 when braveheart first came out i was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film when rob roy came out i was intrigued and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film however as time has gone by my appreciation for rob roy has grown and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well the most significant in my view is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce who was without a doubt scotland s greatest king another is the historical inaccuracy of the film which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the beginnings of mel gibson s egomania can be seen clearly for the first time in contrast rob roy has grown on me over the years partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart but also because rob roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing 
__label__0 did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 2 god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can t think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2 why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don t explain it at all the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl hera particularly after adama said there was no way he d attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the cylon base that s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew s lives and how did anders know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters lives before the war it s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread the word forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it frakken wouldn t 
__label__0 i cannot get past the message of this movie it s laid out much too clearly to ignore and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it s about i haven t read the novel but pollack s film opens with a scene at a cia front organization in new york which is broken into by two professional assassins headed by max von sydow who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we ve come to know and understand the staff include an elderly female receptionist a fussy elderly professorial guy who s toupee falls off when he is machine gunned is that a joke and last the beautiful tina chen who looks up from the copier realizes she is about to be murdered and says pitifully brave i won t scream von sydow replies sympathetically i know these murders are completely unexpected savage unmotivated by anything that we are aware of and graphic it is a brutal scene there is absolutely no way in which von sydow and his henchman can be redeemed and yet that is exactly what pollack tries to do towards the end after having killed these innocent good guys von sydow switches sides because the other side is willing to pay him and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural cia plot the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable sensitive human being it is better to live in europe things are not so rushed or whatever i swear i m not making this up pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat that s the message you should write it down in case you forget just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values not to mention common sense upside down like that i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states even hate it and who see conspiracies just about everywhere providing a knee jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends nevertheless at some point this dislike this hatred if it increases in intensity must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric i don t for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official i don t care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the louvre on the metro whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation i d like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message but i can t it s quite well done in some ways that s worse because it makes the film less dismissable even new york city looks photogenic on the screen and it s been a long time since i ve thought of new york as photogenic robert redford does an admirable job of projecting his character s initial shock and confusion but then turns into a telecommunicational semi genius and man he looks just fine his wardrobe is just right even his rimless glasses are becoming and his peacoat it s not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous he seems extremely handsome too the swine i want to look like that i want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache faye dunaway is alright in her role but it s not too believable a role would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint even if he did look like redford would anyone be emotionally wounded if when this ambivalent relationship is about to end redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened cliff robertson is surprisingly good he does one or two extremely good double takes the mailman is superb the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and for once we really don t know for sure how it will turn out because redford a book reader after all seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin this is one of john housemann s final roles a shame he s a magnet on screen and what an end to his life a friend finds him lost wandering the streets of new york in a neighborhood he d been familiar with for most of his life yes the movie is very well executed but i can t ignore that vicious paranoid message i have the same problem with leni riefenstahl s triumph of the will or her olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which jesse owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously this negro is dangerous 
__label__0 i m not a regular viewer of springer s but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally i m going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry springer uncensored first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film s running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo farce about trailer trash jealousy incest and deception jaime pressley who looks hot as hellll is a trailer trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather a very unusual looking chain smoking drunken michael dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show that s right no springer and then we have a parallel story with an african american couple they take it to the jerry show the characters collide blah blah freakin blah trash has rarely been this borrringg i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie well now it s totally obvious whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie how can i explain it s a total mess of a motion picture if that s what you call it it s so badly edited with scenes that just don t connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it s simply all over the map just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs my only positive note is a hot girl girl scene that s as risque as it gets don t get me wrong the scene s pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on springer s program this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized my score 3 out of 10 
__label__1 i am quite the mitchell leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that i rented this movie but the print i got was extremely bad so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair the movie was so dark so dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark you can t see a single thing that said i believe i share the same opinion as the first review of this movie it starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical hollywood 30 s movie heck not even your typical hollywod movie of any era it seems the director has been influenced by the europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as maggie carole lombard and skid fred macmurray meet you half expect them to start singing make believe from show boat it starts with a few laughs and poor anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of english gets slapped around by freddie skids is a bum who doesn t care that he s a bum that s why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world he s just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans she misses her boat for new york this is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those french movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings the scenes are so well acted by lombard and cecil cunningham the movie gains a pulse macmurray is good too as he and lombard fall for each other as she nurtures his talent for the trumpet then the temptress arrives in the form of dorothy lamour enough with plot the movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me they are very good and lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half a bit more is called of freddie and he fails to deliver the goods with a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don t believe the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure set design and direction it is worth a look for what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936 37 season i don t know its exact rank though 
__label__0 i ve never found charley chase very funny even though his on screen character sometimes reminds me of john cleese whom i find very funny charley chase also reminds me of gowky hen broon from scotland s sunday post comics page in chase s best films i tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him i ll give chase credit that his very best films such as mighty like a moose and his wooden wedding have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him but i m positive that even the most die hard chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude married to order just isn t funny at all chase eager awkward gormless naff is a young swain hoping to court the fair rose oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father who disdains chase as a mollycoddle leo white who did more notable work as a foil for chaplin at essanay is on hand here as a rival there s some action involving an ingersoll watch i was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles is this an early example of product placement sadly a major flaw in married to order is the casting of rosemary theby as rose she s meant to be a standard issue ingenue but theby flat chested hawk faced is physically wrong for the role theby the wife of harry myers had a successful career as a screen actress but was never a believable ingenue film historian william k everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books i ll rate married to order just 3 out of 10 and i m being charitable because i keep suspecting that charley chase has got something that everyone else gets but i keep missing 
__label__1 a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul brad pitt and craig sheffer whose reverend father tom skerritt is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two this story describes the slow progression of the brothers lives and how their lives separate on two different paths it is a touching movie narrated by the director robert redford playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead certain themes recur in the movie such as memory death eternity and dreams most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul he is a capable charming and brave man but has his fatal flaws the closing lines sum up the point of the movie then in the arctic half light of the canyon all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the world s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters 
__label__0 what s up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a lawyer s office where everyone works by candlelight don t waste your time in fact don t waste your time with anything altman makes it s all a pretentious waste of film 
__label__0 not too keen on this really the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing i enjoyed the first 10 minutes bill nunns good after that it was pretty appalling tim doesn t fit the role he comes across as a smug self inflated ass pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player it s a idealist film and as a musician feel slightly offended after watching it there s no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates he s completely self indulgent i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character maybe i m watching the wrong film if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle 
__label__1 i must say i thought i had seen it all i am an extremely jaded movie buff this movie didn t shock me by any means i m way past that point but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn t know i could go to i had no idea i could ever find ick the idea of beastiality erotic never never never ever ever but there you go he did it i have to give the director credit he pulled it off for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn t a mistake then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married then some nervous guy shaves then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake in fact i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorian era gal being ravaged by a beast thing in the forest the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat heh heh of the whole deal it s beautifully shot superbly edited and does deliver the goods they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn t either oh well i would definitely recommend this film the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it 
__label__1 i thought this movie was excellent for the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the business it was packed with action and a little romance but there were some points when corrine didn t speak very clearly when she threatened sean with the gun and she clenched her teeth maybe she was supposed to i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very well and there was an obvious contrast also because i watched next action star i am certain that corrine and sean did their own stunts which were performed very well i am looking forward to another movie by the pair as they make a great team or perhaps a sequel to bet your life possibly called making it big in the big apple it could this time be about carmen bet your life is excellent 
__label__1 true it does not follow the book very closely but it s still a very entertaining take on the story swayze was far better in the role than i expected and doody avoided the silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness portrayal most of us probably expected cf kate capshaw in indiana jones the temple of doom at any rate it s amazingly better than richard chamberlain s awful pair of quatermain flicks it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways about the only thing i didn t care for was all the mysticism but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre like how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen heh 
__label__0 i ve almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed however things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black no songs this movie page 3 plenty of songs while black was weak to an extreme page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting good direction the songs were almost incidental blended in almost seamlessly with the film there certainly weren t any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director there was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable i d recommend this films for hindi speaking people with at least a slight understanding of mumbai life the former because the english subtitling was below par and contained many errors which at times completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement the latter because you ll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you ve lived it yourself i d definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition the scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash the movie does fall short in a few places though where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film i also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well it was a touch amusing to watch rather than arouse any feelings of sadness the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish these are minor issues though because the film on the whole is truly a rare treat to watch overall it s a cynical pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that actors not heroes that s the key a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting everyday life a behind the scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema 8 10

__label__1 this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old stalwarts of british television denis waterman james bolam and alun armstrong as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the leadership of younger career focused amanda redman the three quirky irritable old cops make a brilliant team applying twenty year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then sometimes with effect at other times to the horror of their senior officers the three are portrayed sympathetically warts and all there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts at the end of the first six part series we are promised a further series next year each of the characters had developed widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wife s untimely death lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past and keep taking the medication while amanda redman has to face the all too familiar conflict between having a life and a career the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dna testing but it is the interplay of four of britain s finest actors which has made the series unmissable 
__label__0 i saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des nouvelles images du japon in paris though i wasn t expecting much from it i have to say i ve been disappointed just like many people in the audience if i wanted to sum up how i felt i d say i ve been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end of course it s silly but i couldn t help it the stories are quite different but the worlds pictured are very much alike and from this point of view a tree of palme definitely can t stand the comparison with miyazaki s masterworks even if it s quite good technically boredom remains in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it i rated it 2 out of 10 a bit harsh i guess it deserves 3 or 4 
__label__0 there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this one there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters don t spend the time on this one 
__label__0 i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales well for the previous it is better than daytime television though i m not sure how much it does have its points but after about the first 20 30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together in short a terrible sci fi channel type movie it has its points such as the future is dirty like blade runner showed of course this is no blade runner the captain looks sort of feels like actor robert forster the kind of person one might want to be around but unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of aliens the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified and the new captain might as well be like jan michael vincent running around on danger island in the banana splits he only put on the uniform with the epaulets he s got very little right to it all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the eureka maru as they are fighting a class of people who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities just like the nietzcheans in andromeda it might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot he probably had fun doing it but it doesn t help the movie much it s okay okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel one might watch it once but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it all for me that was the femme fatale when she was fighting 
__label__1 it s funny it s not arthur miller or t s elliot but man this is funny kline and fields are great her toss off line god you are so disgusting as she climbs in his window great kline s running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher great too robert downey jr and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly until he finds out who she really is a soap opera turn if there every was one the scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental price doesn t solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime t v i hope just a lot of fun 
__label__1 there s no way to confront zabriskie point from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you d use for other movies this is because it isn t a movie it s an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film what we see are not the unfoldings of a plot but rather a sequence of events that we don t see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends we we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us no one we know but we ve doubtless heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere so what do we see events we see people arguing driving and inevitably escaping only the escape is from something intangible it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness or human nature set in late 1960s los angeles our players act against and in response to the self inflicted miseries of modern existence these creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible the characters are not themselves criminals they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar non manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday not that they are ever happy or sad but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living they only achieve true life in the natural world even though that is the next victim of modern existence at the end zabriski point is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world as even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit 
__label__1 this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earth kind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenography the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war famine etc the female characters here are two subcommander t pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and t pol is made to be a vulcan babe some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the tng crew but creates interesting dynamics a very good pilot though for a very good series 
__label__0 i entered the theatre intending to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not enlightened i left neither entertained nor enlightened this movie can t make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything there are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references the 400 blows for this character come off it while none of the characters gets treated with much respect the over thirty gay men get the worst of it all predatory fat sad slobs if you re in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out parting glances longtime companion trick all over the guy red dirt maurice philadelphia instead you ll thank me 
__label__1 a long time ago i watched this movie from the middle on cable i then had a crush on mary moronov i saw her again in eating raoul i was convinced that she s the hottest woman on screen i maybe biased about this movie 9 out of 10 this s the only movie i own on original tape 
__label__1 a charming funny film that gets a solid grade all around i saw a screener of this film recently at work it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day so much so that i figured i d write in not sure if this film is going to theaters but i hope it does its a nice film to see with friends its a charmer and has some funny jokes the acting was terrific especially howard hessman and larry dorf the directing was pretty good not a film that needed to be over directed what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing it was like neil simon seinfeldish and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm as an aspiring screenwriter i notice those things i m a dork anyway a really cute film that i recommend 
__label__1 i really dislike both shrek films since their both pg and have words in them i would never say myself so i disliked them but when it comes to spirit stallion of the cimarron which i just barely watched for the first time last month i became a fan of animated films other than pixar spoilers ahead in spirit stallion of the cimarron a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard one night he sees a strange light in the distance and he sets off toward it this action eventually leads to his capture and several more things throughout the movie we hear a narration it s through the thoughts of spirit though the horses never talk this is what makes the movie so goo they the movie makers recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made none of those sounds were made by humans spirit meets rain a beautiful mare and little creek a native american who owns rain little creek later frees spirit and rain they go running home i have never been a big fan of brian adams but i intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future watch this film and you won t regret it my score 10 10
__label__0 i ve seen this film several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer for a school film is very well produced and directed but the story well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film the character named tim watcher needed some in dept approach this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films the script is always superficial but still i liked this movie parabens congratulations 
__label__1 this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen the writer director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you insomniac s nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen is it a dream or reality this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious it has an eery feel with it s dark interpretations of illusions dominic monaghan really became the insomniac he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either he really poured his whole being into this role from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative creative writer director cinematographer 
__label__0 an uptight voyeur who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they re off to discover america get the idea there s not an original moment in this whole movie 
__label__0 i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe and robert rodriguez i assumed that upon seeing rr s name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he s going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right wrong wrong wrong by far the worst editing since manos hands of fate the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they owed somebody but they are way to good for this besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn t even talk so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but don t say you weren t warned 
__label__1 a bit quirky and bordering bad taste but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching a wheelchair bound young woman jane hatchard helena bonham carter is teamed with a reluctant caregiver richard kenneth branagh richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight he builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it he wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent dying jane who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills wheelchair bound and full of spirit her last dying wish is to loose her virginity she offers herself to richard who won t help her directly but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed i found this flick ambitious and humorous even in this role carter has a certain charisma and likability 
__label__1 hollow point though clumsy in places manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie the primary entertainment value here is humor everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy oh by the way advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie 
__label__0 what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70 s 80 s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop 
__label__0 you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed that s why movies like fast and the furious dhoom rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones we live on a tiny island and i cannot fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 tax when they reach our shores and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one not only that the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear lest they reach the sea and these movies are relatively easy to make hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic for once those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long can t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame however they don t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park the guy sitting beside me i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car s appear and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans so there we have it the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage as does the gt here the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification that even i m impressed alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that has wings for doors but seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time they re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment i mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the apex of motoring but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow they do so because they can there s no story in redline just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator mind you tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steering wheels gear shifts always shifting up and not down all these while having the actors make pretend that they re the baddest asses with an engine snarling and giving each other dirty looks not a very tall order for an actor and that s why we get the most woeful performances ever with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids the heroine yes it made a statement that girls can drive natasha a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds a girl with model looks who don t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil who has racing pedigree within her and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts lubricants and going for rides introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous eddie griffin she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle everything else well like i said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race and it s almost always the same as there s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker sun kang and of course the star it created vin diesel redline had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where it s one man one car and a 105 minutes race against time to get to vegas if not for the cars then this movie seriously is a piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action strictly for the car fans or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines 
__label__1 yes it s over the top yes it s a bit clichéd and yes constance marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the show s still fun to watch since it s a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gags george lopez is funny don t take him seriously and the show s a winner i m sure he didn t intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious i do have to say that the one big dark bitter spot is benny i hate the character so much so that anytime she s on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i don t have to hear her there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george as the character would stand by such a deplorable person for so long even so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show now there s a bad sitcom 
__label__0 i have always said that some plays by their very nature just can t be translated to film and this one is a prime example as a play this is a very funny farcical satire of the catholic church with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not sinned since his last confession so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven that s just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes and in the make believe world of the theater it works however that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film and it certainly doesn t here director marshall brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach seek out a production of the stage play instead you won t be disappointed 
__label__1 cb4 was awful but it may have given cundieff the idea to it better more like spinal tap than anything else the film is clever from the start surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties the performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters more like marx brothers these guys are real and slightly diverse they react to situations like any of us might well we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig or pull guns and beat down a record company exec but you get the picture n n as w with h hats takes itself seriously enough to reel you in then you re hooked rent or get this at all costs even if you re not really into rap music this will still leave you gassing out loud comparing this to cb4 is like comparing george lucas star wars to gil gerards buck rogers i think you see my point
__label__0 is rich ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean or is she just overreacting or more precisely overacting as usual actually both are applicable in director joseph losey s wandering meandering mess called boom appropriately titled since tempers in the lush luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode richard burton climbs taylor s mountain uninvited she dresses him in a samurai s robe complete with saber though great looking in widescreen the picture is otherwise quite deadly a failure even liz n dick philes should shun the stars collective what the hell attitude to their late 60s film careers reached an ego mad nadir here pointless confused and maddening boom is a catastrophe although screenwriter tennessee williams who adapted his own unsuccessful play the milk train doesn t stop here anymore was said to be quite fond of it from 
__label__1 except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn t come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating eight out of ten stars 
__label__1 any way the wind blows is tom barmans who is also know as front man of the rock formation deus debut movie entirely shot in antwerp belgium the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different story lines are left wide open the movie has a purely instrumental sound track that will rock your socks off in most scenes the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time the main scene in the film the party is very well shot the director didn t hesitate to use video clip techniques having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i ve heard lately the screenplay is great stuff camera angles and colors are very well chosen the costumes are very hot and very seventies too and i loved most of the acting the thing i liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd surreal very dry or even cynical humor that interleave without claiming to be a comedy this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times this is one more directors debut that shouldn t be an ending i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time cheers 
__label__1 first off i m a huge fan of 80s movies and of jennifer conelly as well so yesterday i wandered into a local used book movie store and found a vhs copy i read the back and it sounded good and for 3 99 it was a good deal so i took it home and popped it in the vcr what a sweet movie at my age now i relate more to movies like about last night or st elmo s fire but still i remember what it was like to be 15 16 and in love with an older guy etc we all have those little crushes when we re younger and if it doesn t work out we re heartbroken and we think that we ll never get over it but of course we do many times it s that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie the feeling of oooh i remember when something like that happened to me is all through it the characters are interesting and well developed i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives 
__label__0 i don t want to go off on a rant here but this is the worst film i ve ever seen worse than the avengers incompetent directing disjointed writing and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout shot on very cheap video it looks like a high school project but without the emotion the lighting frequently looks like a single sun gun the sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera but everything else about this thing is just awful the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution the techie elements are patently absurd and the editing looks worse than a rough cut it s not even bad enough to be funny it s just bad btw the packaging is intentionally misleading lion s gate owes me 4 00 
__label__1 in 1990 brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny s obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers in fact he s got a most unusual odyssey planned he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers but he and forbes are flat broke fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life lewis s dialog and forbes s reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country for those who like their slasher flicks they don t come better than kalifornia 
__label__1 a case of being in the right place at the right time what a fascinating film it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people he gets things done he is accessible and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much he has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people mostly the poor and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case just like the iraq war or the war on terror or those missing wmd s or how about the axis of evil people need to wake up and get different points of view stop the neo cons ruling the world go watch this movie with an open mind and make your own mind up then i suggest you see aaron russo s america freedom to fascism it is not the people of america that are the problem it is the government 
__label__1 wow a truly fantastic trip movie that has tons of super surreal imagery dark intent and a black pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world it s populated with a very cute off world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds as with all cool fantasy the wandering plot is secondary to the eye popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death deluge water elephants samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish i d never heard of it but now i love it probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil work of american cartoonist bill plympton it s a demented delight for fans of odd pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i d miss something amazing simply put it s hello kitty without the o 
__label__1 this movie pretty much surprised me i didn t have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary rhoda was very funny and well written they didn t spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren t relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very entertaining my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit com and i think i might agree with her 
__label__0 as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie i was immediately excited the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldn t wait to see the second one especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies however when i saw it i left the theater extremely disappointed as did many other movie goers at the theater with me while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them in the first movie there was constant fighting going on it seemed but the second took a much more and much unfortunate preachy point of view to sum up the plot there wasn t much to it that wasn t expected the machines were digging toward zion with intent of destroying it that s not a spoiler everyone saw it in the commercials the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous unless you re a psychology major you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie and because of that simply won t care it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and trinity agent smith for as bad ass as he was in the first movie seemed to get all religious and preachy personally i don t need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it the movie was a serious waste of my time and i don t think i can watch the first one anymore the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge and the ending of the movie shoved me right off what movie ends with to be concluded how original is that folks i wonder if the wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one in conclusion the movie was bad and that s the end of it 
__label__0 ok this is the third in the series of carnosaur lets star with the dinosaur puppets in the start of the film you cant see the dino s cause when the body count starts you can only see the dino s eye vision pretty smart to hide the bad puppets and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader rance the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body s after the dino rampage after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream pretty creepy and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found it pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet wtf the story is simple 1 some terrorist s attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there 2 they where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t rex in there how did the t rex fit in there 3 rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive 4 holy jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats 5 the dino s is now on a boat in the pacific 6 strange i didn t know that the t rex had a strange thing on hes neck 7 the end the film is good if you want a good laugh 5 10=(
__label__0 it s somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you ve guessed it that film is parasomnia i ve often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing but it seems fairly transparent in this case that s not to say parasomnia is terrible but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be on the plus side it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story it s the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly then the story is losing you and that s what kept happening to me with this film other reviewers have mentioned this here and i don t want to get into spoiler territory but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life all in all there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special 
__label__1 this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 rpm got lost and any cassettes i made are also long gone i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin esp little st nick it also contained a few little known songs original even though it was done at the end of the 70 s this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon 
__label__1 this one has a lot going for it sinatra styne cahn pamela britten and a lesser amount of dross iturbi grayson plus a little ho hum kelly it was sinatra s first real movie where the producer s spent a buck and you could see it on screen previously he d appeared in two low budgeters higher and higher and step lively but if they d only relied on the sinatra pipes and deep sixed grayson s plus iturbi s ego tripping piano spots we d have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for sinatra as it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with kelly we hate to leave i begged her to his own solos what makes the sunset the charm of you and i fall in love too easily despite this step lively remains the best sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget 
__label__1 i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards much the best drama of the piece is in the mid section and then it plays as melodrama arising from the high concept science fiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over the top as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardson s mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey s aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the small fry nature of his kingdom it s not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of it everytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the things to come seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal life yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasn t got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedged bet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say it s not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in 1940 well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly 30 years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such contraption in 2036 a technocratic socialist we don t believe in independent nation states type government in britain after 1970 hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable anti war sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship whether boneheaded luddite fascist as under the boss or all hands to the pump scientific socialism will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in 1936 there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers vision on other matters much of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from 1940 would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashing eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isn t explored but then this was the 1930s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for richardson and scott and chapman slightly i would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous yet the script is ultimately over earnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate things to come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a metropolis tis much as silly in wells words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it ;)
__label__0 okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying renting the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing 
__label__1 i found this movie to be very good in all areas the acting was brilliant from all characters especially ms stone and morissey tramell s character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute the plot is interesting even though this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserves better than what it got from the audience which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie before it even started you won t regret it if you go see it 
__label__1 well i said it all in the summary i simpley adore the movie and the cast i would give each actor an oscar great great movie i m 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won t cry and i always do about 2 or 3 times meryl s was absolutely brilliant jeremy irons also just brilliant i wish the movie received more awards i really don t know anybody who watched it and didn t loved it also glenn close was fantastic the story was beautiful and sad at the same time i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much and how blanca was close to her parents ;)
__label__1  slaughter high is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion just the ten of them of course and low and behold marty murders them one after another british actress caroline munro maniac leads the cast as the heroine who dies anyway the acting is completely awful there s also no suspense at all plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore freaks a guy s stomach explodes another female victim literally gets an acid bath a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted a guy is crushed by a tractor one girl is drowned and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester s mask and the setting a beautiful old english castle is really nice however the dream finale is utterly pathetic all in all it s true that slaughter high is a piece of garbage but i enjoyed it only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks 
__label__1 i enjoyed this movie and after watching it it made me wonder just how many caitlin rose s exist in the world how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another because as this film demonstrates who s right is not foremost important its who is popular and feared which manipulates the minds of youths and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend this is the kind of film that doesn t get the exposure it deserves remarkable and brilliant too good to be just a film made for tv 
__label__0 body slam 1987 is a flat out terrible movie the low budget reeks the direction is pedestrian at best and the writing and acting is lame but if you re into old school wrestling circa 1970 s through the mid 80 then you ll be more entertained than the average viewer i have to warn you this movie stinks on ice i gave it a two because i felt like being generous this turkey was directed by stunt master hal needham the stars are roddy piper the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c list actors dirk benedict the synopsis of this movie is about a promoter who wants to combine hair rock and wrestling but their are others that don t want him to succeed there s more but i don t want to spoil it for you if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline there s a few surprises near the end for die hard wrestling fans i wouldn t recommend this to my worse enemy and i mean it 
__label__0 how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it s terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it s so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create 
__label__1 i enjoyed albert pyun s nemesis for its cheesy action and semi complicated script a lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why nemesis 2 nebula has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super action to carry it through this one gives the name of the first movie s hero alex to a bulked up super female sent to the past to save the future she is raised by a tribe in africa a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that it doesn t take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her don t get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great there are subplots involving africa s political unrest treasure hunting and tribal combat the picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle babe vs cyborg it has its entertainment value just don t expect quality or anything of the first movie 
__label__1 a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top 10 actors certainly of my time he can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the 1970 s hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characters tom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian 
__label__1 i looked at this movie with my child eyes and i wasn t disappointed the story is well known some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio mamooth sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal and i don t want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture briefly it works it is funny and it is a must see with your children they ll like it 
__label__0 for getting so many positive reviews this movie really disappointed me it is slow moving and long at times the story is not clear particularly in the evolving relationships among characters my advice read the book it s a fabulous story which loses it s impact on screen 
__label__0 i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so i didn t know who had done it at first the longer i saw it the more i started thinking jesus this looks like an albert pyun flick wasn t quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the utah desert scenery was beautiful and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor paulin must have ad libbed the many clever one liners he shot out because albert pyun hasn t written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career unfortunately paulin doesn t have all that much screen time before he s gone and the movie s the worse for it lance henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as he s done in countless other movies like this i don t know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it he goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent kathy long the nominal hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesn t have an iota of acting talent but that doesn t matter in a movie like this this being an albert pyun film it s full of the trademarks that we ve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured ah nobody ll ever notice as bad as this movie is however it s a shade above most of pyun s other efforts this is citizen kane compared to his brain numbing adrenaline feel the rush for example the fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying alright already go to something else and long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great derrière it s not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but it s not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun s usual extravaganzas you could do worse than rent this movie not much worse granted but worse nonetheless 
__label__0  bad at being intentionally bad this little gem shot straight onto the mst3k big screen while it s obvious the movie isn t trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgeted in short paint my muscle car prune colored 
__label__1 the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift an outstanding and all too underappreciated actress time travel movies usually don t interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft but this movie was fascinating and creepy it didn t rely on outrageous special effects and it didn t focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all 
__label__1 surely one of the mysteries of the modern world this film is not considered to be within the top 100 films of all time if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how al pacino s performance is as good as it gets 
__label__1 leave it to braik to put on a good show finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot they are completely what started adult swim brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 it may not have been platinum but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made that is why i like it so much it is just such a classic in the adult swim history i believe this is just such a great show if you don t like it hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it 
__label__0 frank tashlin s the home front is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster the home front instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy it s a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact 
__label__1 i really love this movie i remember one time when i was in 2nd grade my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film reel this movie however can be a little frightening for 2nd graders such as the scene where bill murders nancy and seeing fagin s face for the first time on the screen one of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class if i were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film i would give them an a 
__label__1 this musical is decidedly mixed and none of the elements really fit together but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse s novel but none of its virtues though he co wrote the script the songs though charming have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot even by pre oklahoma standards burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points there are a few high points reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie and stops mugging like a silent actor and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied 
__label__0 this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc funny thing is you probably couldn t make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police nonetheless woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes snipes had a lot of funny put down lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film which doesn t bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters that includes woody s girlfriend played by rosie perez there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i can t honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
__label__1 if the australian post office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it this is one of those movies who s heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again miranda s performance is touching as it shows an aspect of australia unimagined by many europeans in that it can be cold wet and bleak just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you the characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a dead letter office a thought to be considered miranda has gone on to do bigger movies but i hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one 
__label__0 national lampoon s class reunion was a flop when it was released it didn t stay long in theaters in my big city why because it s bad not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey the idea is actually great a parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect just avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire 
__label__0 i rented this dvd for two reasons a cast of great actors and the director even though robert altman can be hit or miss in this case it was a big miss altman s attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like dead again i didn t think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and i hope it didn t ruin his reputation robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one time oscar winners on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating money films such as this one duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not tender mercies but the great santini this movie was truly a big waste of time i give it a 2 out of 10 
__label__1  the house that dripped blood is one of the better anthology films of the time period spoilers tracking down a missing film star inspector holloway john bennett finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside during the course of looking through the house he is told four different stories about past residents of the house the good story s method for murder moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while charles pens his latest masterwork horror novelist charles hillyer denholm elliott and his wife alice joanna dunham are thrilled with the story which centers around a serial strangler named dominic after a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife probably one of the better entries in the film it s easily the creepiest the atmosphere here is what sets it apart the scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there s always a classic creep out moment the classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist s office which is an all time high for creepiness the build up to it with the creaking sounds quick flashes of a mysterious being and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one s favor sweets for the sweet moving into a new house widower john reid christopher lee hires former school teacher ann norton nyree dawn porter for his young daughter jane chloe franks while he s away on business ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from jane s past which john vehemently denies when she learns the true nature of what has happened it s far more shocking that what she could ve thought possible with the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories this is a quite pleasant entry the mystery of the family is wonderfully played out with small amounts of clues piled up here and there and the final revelation is downright nerve wracking that part alone is the main reason why this one works and lee doesn t harm it either the bad story s waxwork tortured by memories of his lost love phillip grayson peter cushing and his friend neville rogers joss ackland both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a wax museum as the statue takes over their lives they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them there s a clever premise here and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum which are always creepy this is no exception and it looks eerie which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace it takes a long time for events to unfold out and most of the time is spent on exposition it also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away those really lower this one a bit had the twist been changed it would ve scored higher the rest is acceptable the cloak veteran horror film actor paul henderson jon pertwee upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store the cloak soon turns him into a vampire going crazy on the set with co star carla ingrid pitt and other vampiric acts at home unconvinced the cloak is the cause he does everything he can to prove it s just in his imagination this has a pretty decent premise and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares but what sinks it is several factors first it s just too goofy for it s own good the plot twist at the end is a perfect example which is so overdone that it s not really a shock at all and just comes across as just plain silly there s so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it s just a bore to sit through it s the weakest one in the film the final verdict a quite decent omnibus film there s a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy british horror films today s rating pg 13 violence
__label__0 this movie is not as good as all think the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic like i respect fantasy but lord of the rings is fantasy conan is fantasy this is just normal hk lowprice entertainment why did they include this splatter tongue it makes everything worse the only good thing is the cinematography and the cutter s job 
__label__1 stunning absolutely stunning this is a movie about two kids who s father suddenly has a vision he claims an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill demons he gets instructions later and they start rounding up the demons which are to the naked eye ordinary people they kill these so called demons with an ax to the head and chop them up burying them in the rose garden their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them the movie continues with a twist at the end the thing that i love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception is their father completely mad or is he telling the truth the audience is left to decide go make the judgment for yourself and see the movie now 
__label__1 i knew about but had never seen grey gardens before i saw the broadway musical of the same name friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense it did but it also prompted me to rent the movie at first i thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch but being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age they have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re examine your own dealings with your mother in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it s fascinating to see the mayleses work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had i echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family but beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film 
__label__1 both my friend and i thought this movie was well done we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie if you don t buy rent it for a good time 
__label__1 wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei i hope he has more stories in him the acting is sublime renying zhou as doggie was amazing very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight very believable as the jaded old traditionalist the soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem 
__label__0 just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself seriously even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen never bothered to post a comment on here before but this piece of crap really warrants it firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical brother of the lead character either ben or arthur i forget which is which and frankly it s never very clear wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight because homosexuality is abhorrent to christians but apparently mass murder isn t then there s some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple s ex wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint this leads to nothing but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole film i don t make sense you don t make sense that s who makes sense brilliant then there s the acting which is just atrocious it must be seen to be believed my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman who is clearly reading her lines off of something yet still managing to mess them up enough said the gay couple couldn t be less convincing there s the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts only fatter and less talented the film has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on yep but anyways we all know how terrible this thing is so i d like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the film provides when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape hilarious mildread no idea what relation she is to the main characters sometimes they know her sometimes they don t but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless hilarious the stoned lawyer already mentioned her but she s so funny she s worth another mention the evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests the evil brother s anti gay potion the evil brother s cats the ending which i won t give away because it must be seen to be believed i warn you though make sure you re not eating at the time the tub of lard main character director producer gets naked it s foul basically ben and arthur is indescribably bad but unintentionally the most comical thing you ll see for a long time literally nothing is good about this excuse for a film the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times 
__label__0 the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality go find a girl marry her live with her happily ever after though the film had some fine moments and turns most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline the baptist mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about probably intentionally a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple if you wanna see a film which doesn t need too much concentration which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values besides the modern tolerance stuff you will be fine with this film might be shown at a family home evening ;)
__label__1  fraidy cat the 4th of these cartoons is a good one at least i like it so i m surprised that this is getting mixed reviews this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one although it has its moments of comedy the atmosphere is dark and spooky suspense is another strong element here as for humor it s mostly dark humor in this short tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts something he believes while tom is scared to death jerry is watching everything and can t help but laugh the whole time in fact jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more with the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big ghost tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life although jerry scares tom without a good reason the way the story is made ends up being funny plus once again there is no violence here because this is one of tom jerry s oldest cartoons however i don t get that joke of tom s 9 lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner when tom finally finds out that it was all a jerry s scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him jerry is caught with the hand in the cookie jar he deserves to be discovered yet tom shows an incredible patience before reacting he angrily looks at jerry for about a minute the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face jerry tries to be funny but tom doesn t laugh overall this is a different peculiar and remarkable tom jerry experience 
__label__0 with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there aren t many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasn t an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to it s full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be skipped completely 
__label__1 the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and super natural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende s novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the 1990s jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as esteban s sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non tropical latin american country settings of clara s home and esteban s ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post war atmosphere 
__label__1 the movie is okay it has it s moments the music scenes are the best of all the soundtrack is a true classic it s a perfect album it starts out with let s go crazy appropriate for the beginning as it s a great party song and very up tempo take me with u a fun pop song the beautiful ones a cheerful ballad probably the closest thing to r b on this whole album computer blue a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia darling nikki one of the funniest songs ever it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia when doves cry the climax to this masterpiece i would die 4 u baby i m a star and of course purple rain a true classic a very appropriate ending for this classic album the movie and the album are both very good i highly recommend them 
__label__1 i really liked this movie i ve read a few of the other comments and although i pity those who did not understand it i do agree with some of the criticisms which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch i also love the movies such as this one which provoke so many debates theories possible endings and hidden subtext congratulations mr crowe definitely in my top ten p s saw this when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip where does the dream end and the real begin 
__label__0 this u s soap opera knots landing has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator every episode contained plots such as rape murder kidnapping and drug smuggling not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period as for the cast i ve seen better actors on a cereal box from the mid to late 90 s repeats of knots stunk up u k gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously though since then re runs have been few and far between let s hope it stays that way the only positive thing that can be said of knots is the catchy saxophone signature tune later used as the title music for the i t v sitcom the upper hand great legacy that eh 
__label__0 is this the worse star trek tos episode maybe at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5 i mean this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense seeing something that makes you go mad give me a break this episode also has a different feel to it the music is heightened almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress to the point that it sucks give me some klingons gorns tholians romulans higher beings like triskelion s or anything but medusin s these are very boring aliens to make an episode around mccoy gets to utter his famous phrase he s dead jim spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but kirk does not they go through that freaking barrier now for the third time that i can remember boring at least season three s next episodes would be spectre of the gun and day of the dove and others to follow making trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans personal observations trek loved to use the color purple its kind of a pinkish purple like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment the gangway that is normally grey is now purple we never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see i noticed it in several episodes it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode in the ships corridor is pretty lame 
__label__1 most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good and bad sci fi movies in hollywood but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land the story is a basic femme fatale premise nothing new or enthralling verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences which instead of defining our main character and his situation are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot the screenplay was solid the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting jereone krabbe was amazing as the tortured artist and the supporters were very good as well also jan de bont s cinematography adds at least some life to the film helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director 6 5 10 1 2 
__label__1 ok so it borrows a little from it s a wonderful life but that was 44 years prior to this film so why not a new attempt belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday he didn t get his wheaties his coffee and has lost his job the capper is when his self described big blue piece of sh car breaks down at the end of the day he heads into an empty bar to call for a tow while waiting he s recognized by the bartender caine as the kid who lost the town s championship baseball game 20 years earlier this gets him to thinking how life would ve been if he had won the game he finds out when unbeknownst to him caine serves up a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion the prom queen russo as his wife and makes him president of the sporting goods company he s been canned from caine later reveals himself as the one who s responsible for this change but belushi is not entirely on board he never fully adjusts and in a plot development that doesn t kill the movie but is still odd he tries to court his wife hamilton from his real life who is now married to someone else the good move is that they don t spend too much time on it as basically they rip of ghost with belushi constantly telling hamilton things only she could know it also brings in a hokey dramatic element as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows new wife russo and his unbalanced lover cox but the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning and cheery end also good work from the big and recognizable cast as belushi is very likable very attractive ladies chosen and caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy strange that this was belushi s second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches which was found in taking care of business though similar both films are on the same level of laughs provided so check this out for a fun exploration of what if 
__label__1 this movie probably had a 750 budget and still managed to surpass titanic i rented this the day i crashed my mom s car and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief it has to be tied with the assult of the killer bimbos things to look for are 1 the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 the flinstone like screech out driving 4 the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed don t worry i m not ruining any surprises for it s soooo predictable 5 the guy who finds it necessary to howl 6 the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen 7 the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest 8 the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall 9 last but not least the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the boob that made a heaven help me popping noise enjoy 
__label__0 what i found so curious about this film i saw the full 4 hour roadshow version is how oddly dispassionate it is for a film about 2 very charismatic men castro and che engaged in a gargantuan political struggle it s almost totally devoid of emotional fire the scenes between benicio del toro and demian bichir who is at best a second level actor with a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che go here go there do this and that with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castro joaquim de almeida but he s shunted aside in a minor part in the second half without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers the film becomes a dullish epic length film about hairy bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end several of the reviews i ve read showered praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely one in fact spent more time talking about soderbergh s new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it s entirely in spanish with english subtitles this is an odd odd thing to do since a soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b it s no more than a competent job of work with an unremarked upon nod to oliver stone s jfk in the black and white cut up camera work when che visits new york if you can imagine reds directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty you d get an idea of the dull competency of this movie 
__label__0 this a fascinatingly awful movie it make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own well it would if it didn t keep darting off up side alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness the movie can t make up its mind whether it is a straight forward man turns into monster flick like all those 1950s the incredible insert verb ing man movies or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie or a mystical afterlife contact story or or what take your pick it s just a mess grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions leaving loose ends flapping all over the place it was as if tobe hooper had been taking david lynch pills unfortunately he didn t take enough 
__label__0 syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it i suppose it s one of those films that is intensely intelligent so intelligent that i think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind i don t consider myself unintelligent i ve been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it s a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it s a 10 10 are lying because they think they look better this film was the most confusing senseless mindless dribble i have seen in awhile especially considering the critical acclaim the oscar nods and the cast screenplay writer stephen gaghan has disappointed me yet again his horribly written havoc preceded this film and i think he s just trying way too hard i can t believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da vinci code screenplay on top of that gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess i had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what it was a disaster because i don t really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright george clooney plays c i a field agent and assassin i think bob barnes clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he s managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character matt damon plays bryan woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it amanda peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn t get top billing anymore the cast is intense if only the story made sense i d like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb a missile disappears in iran but the cia has other problems the heir to an emirate gives an oil contract to china cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a kazakhstani oil contract the department of justice suspects bribery and the oil company s law firm finds a scapegoat the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the emir apparent fails agent bob barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross an american economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the cia wants dead the jobless pakistanis join a fundamentalist group all roads start and end in the oil fields what say who now syriana might be the thinking man s movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn t have bribed me enough to get me to finish it i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour 1 10
__label__1 i love occult horror and the great british hammer studios who delivered one of their greatest films with the devil rides out 1968 have proved to be more than capable in this field of horror this occult tenth episode of hammer s short running tv series hammer house of horror 1980 guardian of the abyss is indeed a creepy entry to the series director don sharp who had previously enriched the hammer oeuvre with the kiss of the vampire 1963 and rasputin the mad monk 1966 and furthermore directed two fu machu movies starring christopher lee is doubtlessly one of the better known names among the hhh directors and he also delivers here antiques dealer michael ray lonnen stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass the scrying glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil worshiping cult who want to use it for their satanic rites when he shelters a beautiful young girl named allison rosalyn landor who is to be sacrificed by the cult michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and their sinister leader john carson while this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of hammer house of horror the best one clearly is the brilliant seventh episode the silent scream it is a very creepy and atmospheric one the plot has several interesting twists and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film ray lonnen makes a good lead young rosalyin landor is convincing as the innocent beauty and john carson is truly creepy as the leader of the satanists overall guardian of the abyss is another interesting and creepy hhh tale and my fellow hammer fans should not miss it 
__label__1 i think this is a lovely family movie there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart warming moments to be had throughout the movie the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team the angels and is great throughout the film also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon levitt and milton davis jr christopher lloyd is good as al the angel and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie a touching and heart warming movie which everyone should enjoy 
__label__0 vincente minelli movies are usually worth your time meet me in st louis the bad and the beautiful i awaited this movie with great interest but what a disappointment some came running is scene after scene of go nowhere fatalism sinatra is a sad sack returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships a disappointing floozy hanging on him living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project the movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with sinatra and macclane and something disappointing happens the sequence is intended to be tension filled but minelli is no hitchcock he gets so distracted by pretty colors he doesn t notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly drawn and poorly developed we don t particularly care that they get shot especially macclane but that s the only real cinematography in the project otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours hell is other people apparently there is nothing going on in this movie the dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after ww2 is handled more deftly in the best years of our lives and either of two inge products splendor in the grass and picnic covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead end town with much more poignance

__label__0 with a title like attack of the killer tomatoes anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a a bad science fiction movie or b a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies it s supposed to be a mix of both with a dose of parody splashed in unfortunately it falls flat very soon you re never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but you re supposed to think it s funny right i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny i e the side by side phone conversations the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal superman walking by lois etc attack of the killer tomatoes strives to be a cult classic but it doesn t make it a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it or a similar description attack of the killer tomatoes could be enjoyed by any 8 year old with a bad sense of humor so therefore it does not qualify as a cult film there is one good actress in the entire thing sharon taylor as lois fairchild she is a thin gawky reporter but has an endearing personality loves to overact and is a natural comedienne unfortunately she is put to bad use here attack of the killer tomatoes is not as funny as say amazon women on the moon or kentucky fried movie but it does have a few hilarious moments so i would still recommend seeing it once avoid the director s cut it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly lost footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect it can be found in english on the out of print tape 
__label__1 when a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague a variant of bubonic plague u s public health service official dr clinton reed richard widmark immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body unfortunately the stiff got that way by being murdered and there s a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague leading to an epidemic enter police captain tom warren paul douglas who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster while panic in the streets is a quality film it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight it wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster police procedural thriller and even romance this is not director elia kazan s best work but saying that is a bit disingenuous kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as a streetcar named desire 1951 on the waterfront 1954 and east of eden 1955 after all this film predates those but kazan has said that he was already untethered by the studio taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl the film is set in new orleans a city where kazan used to wander around night and day so i knew it well he wanted to exploit the environment it s so terrific and colorful i wanted boats steam engines warehouses jazz joints all of new orleans kazan handles each genre of panic in the streets well but they could be connected better the film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods the sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers edna and edward anhalt quarantine and some like em cold the gangster material which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film is probably the highlight not surprisingly kazan has said that he believes the villains are more colorful i never had much affection for the good guys anyway i don t like puritans a close second is the only material that approaches the panic of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed inoculate them and contain the disease while there is plenty of suspense during these two moods much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama with pacing more typical of that genre the dialogue throughout is excellent the stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced it is intelligent delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character conflict isn t created by dumb decisions but smart moves events and characters actions are more like a chess game when unusual stances are taken such as reed withholding the plague from the newspapers he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions which other characters argue over in light of this it s interesting that kazan believed that propriety religion ethics and the middle class are all murdering us that idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm or allowances away from it made by the protagonists for example head gangster blackie jack palance in his first film role is offered a get out of jail free card if he ll cooperate with combating the plague the technical aspects of the film are fine if nothing exceptional but the real reasons to watch are the performances the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue 
__label__0 i disliked this movie for numerous reasons within the first ten minutes of the film i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself for me at least that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug unfortunately that did not occur the two draws of the movie for me were to see jane fonda and felicity huffman i don t know enough about lindsey lohan s work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film afterward i just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were moments in each of their performances i imagine that for each of them to find their moments was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog although the plot is an interesting one the movie on the whole is so poorly written directed and edited that anybody s performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it the disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small town america i think were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it s mark as one reviewer has noted and i would agree the movie is almost impossible to market given it s finished form i suspect that or at least hope that for the actor s sakes anyway there are some real gems on the cutting room floor sad for us but if that s true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop oh yeah and another thing i wished for just once i could go see an american movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren t absentmindedly and or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans smashed cds and other such trash 
__label__1 i don t pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello but i ve never witnessed a performance of the play on film or on stage wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity according to the biographical notes fishburne never received any professional training as an actor perhaps this explains why his acting in this beautifully edited film comes over as so believable and so powerful instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high powered roles fishburne s portrayal is focused more on othello s love for his wife and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal than on violence and vengeance in a word the performance is understated and made far more impressive by fishburne s extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been the acting throughout is superb and the abridged speeches gain grace from their light editing even shakesspeare after all can be improved upon now and again and if that be treason make the most of it 
__label__1 although i have not seen this mini series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between character plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions i ve seen were dubbed english and french but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of odysseus ever returning 
__label__0 nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time it s being brought to you by the never inevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn t click as science fiction it s plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all that s nearly bare to resist give me a f ing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn t set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn t make this one great i d like to point out another film called the assault 1996 by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why top notch 1st person femme fatale action movies don t translate well in america sorry fellas 
__label__1 while this movie won t go down in the annals of great cinema it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named the hungry bachelors club jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open bill nunn plays a cadillac loving mystery man who becomes her lover fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney the ensemble casts made up of familiar faces works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family 
__label__1 this is one of the greatest 80s movies it sticks out like a turd in a punchbowl i can t believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart i speak a no enlish chinese lady and ups guy on speed what s up with that and i love ron leibman he s foxy wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course he s not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national lampoon s vacation if you liked movies such as porky s fast times last american virgin or any of the other 80s teen focused movies you ll love this one rent it and you ll see what i mean 
__label__1 for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite owning the tcm uk cable channel which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out more disappointingly it s still m i a on dvd even from warners recently announced western classics collection box set which does include 3 other robert taylor genre efforts maybe they re saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this stalwart of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60 000 000 to 3 000 in the space of just 30 years as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger who rallies alcoholic peg legged lloyd nolan who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor and teenage half breed russ tamblyn to this end as expected the company s relationship is a shaky one reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony mann s the naked spur 1953 another bleak open air mgm western the film in fact ably approximates the flavor and toughness of mann s work in this field despite being writer director brooks first of just a handful of such outings but which cumulatively exhibited a remarkable diversity here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra paget also a half breed to be contended between the two rugged leads and granger like the james stewart of the naked spur returns to his job only grudgingly his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realized the latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself she bravely but coldly endures his approaches while secretly craving for granger and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk taylor himself doesn t come out unscathed from the deal like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare and therefore precious hide of a white buffalo they ve caught he even goes buffalo crazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species the hunting scenes themselves are impressive buffaloes stampeding tumbling to the ground when hit the endless line up of the day s catch and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows the film s atypical but memorable denouement then is justly famous with winter in full swing a now paranoid taylor out for granger s blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and paget have taken refuge to shoot him when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a hunched position frozen to death incidentally my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this by milton lott from the time of the film s original release actually he has collected a vast number of such editions it is after all a practice still in vogue where a book is re issued to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger who work very well off each other here had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant 1953 which curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that it s not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages 
__label__1 everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have if u can get this movie on video for around 10 it d be an investment 
__label__0 there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it s face well it happens here not to mention the sfx look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life 
__label__0 in 1993 the visitors was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made this is a movie that doesn t keep its promises indeed it s supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddle headed sometimes a bit of a mess but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they re going over the top and become annoying then why did jean marie poiré the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors aren t better marie anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau unbearable of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding a labored and disappointing follow up anyway what s the interest of this movie otherwise commercial 
__label__1  shore leave is mostly an average star trek adventure nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is lightweight entertaining nothing more however i m glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs good but unexceptional 
__label__1 this is an ok adaptation but not as good as the tv version the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again i preferred kate beckinsale s emma there are excellent support performances from toni collette juliet stephenson and sophy thompson the script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set piece gags here and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent my biggest criticism is the scenery it is far too lush england has never been like this it looks like a chocolate box only americans would make it like this despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more 
__label__0 hahahaha funny that sums this movie up in one word what the crap was this thing since it might kill me to use the word movie i hope the director writer and producer didn t mean for this to turn out good because it sure didn t a scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark and the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the island oh my gooooooodddd i hate this film so much that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious parts because they were so corny and unprofessional and they couldn t have made the shark look more unrealistic even though this thing had a bit larger budget than most low budget movies all i have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting and stupid corny dialogue because if you are expecting a good movie you ll be highly disappointed 
__label__1 ok i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don t know why i haven t seen it since but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film again i don t know why but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes comedy is hard much harder than any drama doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong is there anything worse than a bad comedy steve martin pay attention you are falling in this category again for some reason elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly done at a quick pace with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn t the philedelphia story it entertains from start to finish brain donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes one point of contention the ending it seems the writers director had no idea how to finish a comedy the ending tries to be a love story somewhat undermining the quirky fast paced dialogue up to that point then there is the tassle scene whereas this has to be seen male opinion it is so over the top and out of place it s like a shock one more rewrite for the ending was needed this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail but if you don t try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you you ll laugh i guarantee it 
__label__1 2003 was seen as the year of the matrix with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film also released was a dvd of 9 short animated films most written and made in japan and made as anime japan makes some of the best animation in the world sadly most of these shorts are disappointing the best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first matrix film the second renaissance is made as a historical file it tells how humans made machines in their own likeness humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts the workers of society second class citizens in the year 2090 a machine bi 66er was put of trial for murder after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him the machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world the governments of the world order to dismantle machines many machines leave human society and form their own country in the middle east o1 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations forcing them into economic crisis the human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves them the second renaissance is a interesting watch with excellent traditional animation style and sets a compelling world it shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction there is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time the short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film metropolis partly the beginning with the underworld they are the themes of slavery the mistreatment of the working class and racism the short also has some religious themes and religious iconography mainly that men saw themselves as god and created the machines in their own likeness seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines the machines too use religious iconography mainly forming their nation in cradle of human civilisation and the machines coming to the united nations dressed as adam and eve offering an apple the animation style is beautiful done in the traditional anime style like akira the set designs are great combine futuristic with historic cities e g washington d c there is well down future scene and surprising violence which is key to the film the director mahiro maeda also directed the anime sequence in kill bill vol 1 so has good credentials to hollywood he is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going the only real complain is a continuity error to the first matrix film because morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war but its a good watch 
__label__1 what can i say about a tale such as this this magical tale has followed me from my early childhood evoking warm memories in my heart the characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene for example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums the story line was wonderful i wanted so badly for landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with mr brown and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war i am still a child inside and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other this movie is my definite favorite of all times i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away and transported into another time 
__label__0 i m not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time i would like to say however that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous johnnymacbest you can t play that card and i mean the nationalism patriotic card to make people not watch this movie this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country oh yea i played that card even though the director is german and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera but the world is full of controversy and its the same thing you ve heard before like the gta controversy it s a comedy laugh and be disgusted not disgusted all together its dark humor and obviously you don t have the heart to take it the past is past yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on that was 7 years ago you can still watch this movie and have good moral values besides i m insane and who needs a soul 
__label__0 not really spoilers in my opinion but i wanted to cover myself nevertheless as the executive producer morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less a movie with an intentional indie feel and just be absorbed in the mentor be all that you can be theme he plays a alternate universe semi washed up version of the real morgan freeman who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson ca from brentwood to research his next movie role why carson is a mystery to so cal residents he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements paz vega is pretty to watch a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman s research his character is only known as him to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people psst that s him etc unfortunately i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood carried no cash or debit card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has nothing really happens in this movie i don t believe that either of the main character s were substantially changed by their encounter with each other it flirts with the idea of adultery but then that thought fizzles this to me was similar to steve martin s shopgirl without the sexual affair it was self indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience 
__label__0 i am truly beginning to believe that seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become this particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see my first complaint was the cover of the dvd where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap he has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long the whole film was leading up to the finale where seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer there was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of seagals voice even in the middle of a statement the dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical the fight scenes in the film were horrible half the time when seagal fought you could not even see what was going on there would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something it was reminiscent of the old kung fu series on television they used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes i believe this is seagals worst film to date and i am glad i did not purchase this film or i would have been very upset since i am a huge fan of seagal the aikidoist the action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance 
__label__0 i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat but this is no swat swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense bullfighter had none of these i should have realized that it couldn t possibly be any good after all the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role one poster here called the movie incoherent another called it the worst movie ever both gave the movie far too much credit i am so glad i got it from the library for free yet i still feel ripped off imdb needs to include a 0 in the rate this film vote just for movies like this one 
__label__1 moon child starring japanese rockers hyde and gackt was a better movie then i expected in fact i was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies set in mallepa the story follows a group of street orphans sho sho s brother shinji and toshi who rob and murder to make a living on one of robberies sho encounters hyde s kei vampire burning in the sunlight through the coarse of events kei s true nature is shown yet no one shuns him away the time passes and implies that the immortal never changing kei has raised sho and the two have a an extremely close bond sho and kei then encounter son in an outrageous gun fight and they become quick friends both kei and hyde fall in love with son s sister yi che time skips ahead again and shows a grown sho this time void of kei it also explains that sho and son have become enemies through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it s hardships focusing on friendship and love it is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time as for the acting i think gackt did a magnificent job hyde did an amazing job for a first timer the shots were beautiful but the movie did have it s rare and short gruesome shots all in all i must say this movie is amazing moving and i highly recommend it 
__label__0 back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2 one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non related male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end 
__label__0 all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente run lola run franka plays kate a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer intentions plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy scary but plenty that are just plain dull all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell who s done better than this that s even including erasmus microman 
__label__1 this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver inspector clouseau in his stoicism and chauncey gardiner in being there also peter sellers he is single yet doesn t have a clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at all he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood he s 28 and admits he s never had sex very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen where the two software people travel on business they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail my theory is that they re trying the wrong places they go to more or less youth nightclubs they should try the type that has older people more their own age harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort as in taxi driver urging his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke who s pulled a nice looking girl in the nightclub worth watching 
__label__0 perhaps i m out of date or just don t know what electra is like in current publications but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn t particularly convincing and the action was spotty i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller s book electra assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical tha hand was not menacing enough and electra was not bitchy enough she s the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn t care either way 
__label__0 i recently watched the first guinea pig film the devil s experiment and i must admit to being disappointed this film is invariably included in any list of the nastiest films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype the truth is though i don t rate it if i d been watching it believing the opening text to be true i found this tape i might have been a bit disturbed by it thinking it was real even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though i think i d have worked out that it indeed wasn t throughout the film the girl s reactions to what is being done to her just aren t what they should be she should be screaming like a banshee in pain the fact that she isn t means that it s obviously not real i wouldn t want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting the film would be more disturbing and then there are the notorious scenes nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand the hot oil maggots and innards just didn t bother me i m not saying i m hard just that i wasn t able to suspend my disbelief partly because of the girl s inaction the scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber and the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more i didn t want to look away and neither did i feel nauseous perhaps it s because the film is twenty odd years old or perhaps i m just jaded the truth is i didn t find this film at all disturbing it s the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters story etc and just leaving the torture it works on some levels as a disturbing piece of film though it didn t work for me at least i watched guinea pig with my wife who is of the it s just a film bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film she said that she didn t think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that i played her the fire extinguisher scene from irreversible and she was indeed disturbed i m not sure i have a point other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb 
__label__0 this movie is a vehicle for schwarzenegger clone alexander nevsky his charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script he has little to add to his arnie act michael york is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat watching him revisit his d artagnan act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy come on you can do better than that the story is full of holes and unexplained relations top of this bill is the informer of vlad who sounds like an american woman but from the context appears to be working for a russian government department although the story takes place well after the end of the communist regime all the russian characters are still very communist like in contradiction to that vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police car the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics not a must see movie 
__label__1 i ve just finished listening to the director s commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like mann s the insider is completely subjective it s from howard s pov so any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it as ebert did is really about nolte s character actually if you feel as he did that the film does not work then you re saying i think that howard does not work and to be frank you might be right howard s reasoning and personality really wouldn t stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis but hey that s the nature of people andrew 
__label__1 not everything is said in this excellent first feature from céline sciamma the friendship the wanting to fit in the first sexual feelings all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to say thirteen but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless a must see and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door the soundtrack is a by the way bon cinéma 
__label__1 lol delirious was so funny i was in tears eddie murphys impressions are absolutely spot on the best impression was of james brown and mr t so funny its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don t like foul language don t watch but amazing and so funny i have seen it 6 7 times and still pee myself every time this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from he does impressions of his family as well which is real funny if only i was there

__label__0 with a tendency to repeat himself wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with paris texas land of plenty is no exception taking into the fact that i anticipated an average mediocre film even before i went in wenders ambitions seem to always get the better of him it s taken for grated now his films are heavy handed and bombastic i weren t sure if i was watching a comedy that mocks middle america or some thriller the outcome of diehl s character is wholly predicable wender s insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes i am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction interesting that wenders professed that while making paris texas he had great help from sam sheppard with the script yes that was wenders best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter his films from the past 15 years were a total mess 
__label__1 okay but just plain dumb not bad for a horror comedy film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe never seen it the horror possibly comedy uncle sam i ll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21 the day before thanksgiving worth the four bucks l o l at this film 9 10
__label__0 i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon it s similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present days under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial actors s quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art like watch enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor don t write an online review for it will misguide irritate and in the end waste their time on the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for how not to make a movie 
__label__0 if you haven t figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes lilia is a widow she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared the cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her the film is very misogamist it s portrayal of men is dismal which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short lived not short enough i say she does find romance however brief with you guessed it no surprises here we didn t see coming though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way maybe this film just isn t targeting my demographic 30 male
__label__0 this is a low budget spoof of the espionage genre to help frame your expectations you should know that 1 the acting is wildly heavy handed the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and off key pacing 2 the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 shots are frequently framed in off balance angles poking fun at genre excesses 4 a pop eyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner the film has a guiding intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the b films of the 1930 s a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan the film s over the top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes in an early running gag fay grim s son ned is so frequently told to leave that you can t help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad parker posey s nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film the film s slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge the film s impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy moreover it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic the musical score is intentionally heavy handed and i found this and the off kilter camera angles more irritating than humorous the over the top acting the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies counter conspiracies and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers the movie is much too long at 158 minutes that said fans who are receptive to the film s sarcasm might want to watch again using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy handed than light hearted but the comedy may well appeal to your tastes the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films fans of director hal harley or devotees of parker posey who has the most camera time 
__label__0 i wondered why i didn t like peggy sue got married more than i did when it first came out in 1986 with all the hype somehow i found nic cage s character off putting way off putting then the plot didn t seem to make sense then by the end of the credits the question came to mind what point was this movie making what was it saying the answer unfortunately was not much if anything i really don t think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life you re gonna make the same mistakes no matter what so keep your eye upon the doughnut and not the hole not a very profound statement and i m sorry not profoundly made in this movie the writing simply isn t that good the direction is uneven and is strangely overblown at times kathleen turner was the best and in my opinion only worthwhile thing in this movie and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre unexplained circumstances with a script that had no apparent statement to make she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn t enjoy this movie more she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola s direction every step of the way doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid his voice was annoying abrasive and unnatural and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy i understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is setting up his own karma for future failure but he goes overboard the way he does it is abrasive not effective and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the man we would have had a more enjoyable film cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person and those scenes are more watchable than others but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l a to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected put on scenes the movie doesn t aim for a statement doesn t make a point is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression but without the voice and is ultimately confusing and a waste of time given all this kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie i can t recommend anyone spending two hours watching this unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes believe me you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes and it will make just as much sense kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments which proves that she s strong enough to be honest and to hell with other people s comments you go turner i m not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first rate actor or actress but her candor is refreshing cage s acting can be good to annoying and here it doesn t work at least in this film now we know why 
__label__1 johny to makes here one of his best style exercises making a strong film with a good yakuza s story the election of the new yakuza s boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film i specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the yakuza s family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problems talking about the technical aspects the film is a good example of paused rythmic and planified way of shooting a film one of the hong kong films of the year is like infernal affairs but without the easy action violence scenes and the confused storyline strongly recommended to all asian films lovers sorry for my english better do in spanish lol 
__label__0 i had high hopes for this film i thought the premise interesting i stuck through it even though i found the acting save helena bonham carter unremarkable i kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing maybe in george orwell s version there is a message worth conveying if this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read orwell s classic i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption if the film maker s message is the mundane life is worth living well then they ve succeeded i would recommend this film to no one 101 minutes of my life wasted 
__label__1 from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life the idea of two giant robots manned by brilliant humans fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced i can t even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script let s just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures combined the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is robot jox 
__label__1 the image of movie studios being financially driven instead of creatively is not without truth in fact it s more true than false this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full length uncut version of hamlet with his complete creative control among other things of course branagh had to agree to some concessions a star studded cast and a 2 5 hour version for wider release but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see could they have at least in this case had enough respect for the material and branagh s vision to create something for only a few people that is not a question that i can answer whatever the reason this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching hamlet everyone knows the story so i will not spend much time on that however unlike other productions of the play stage included this is a completely uncut production which has never been done before according to some shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut leaving the decision of what to include to the director s discretion that being said i have no doubt that had he been able to see it the bard would have been overjoyed with branagh s production the film is top heavy with film stars although most have mere bit parts all play their parts equally well i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet and while he still may be his performance more than makes up for it hamlet is a complex part displaying every emotion from grief to anger happiness to madness and everything in between branagh nailed it derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion his unique voice is perfect for the role julie christie is also very good as gertrude hamlet s caring mother who doesn t realize what is going on until late in the game the classical actors are cast in bit parts judi dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines but at least they re in it surprisingly no one takes this to heart everyone gives it their all and it shows special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal who are excellent robin williams is a little too silly but he s not bad his part is pretty small anyway yet this is undeniably branagh s show he adapted one of the most famous plays in history and in so doing he took on a whale of a project it s impressive that he got it done but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement what i really liked about this film is that you don t have to be a shakespeare scholar to enjoy it as most people know shakespeare is difficult to digest but branagh and his cast understand this hamlet is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting this is a must see for anyone and everyone it may be four hours long but it s definitely worth it 
__label__0 i cannot stand this show has there ever been even one redeeming quality one funny punchline or one plot line that didn t make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes the voices oh those horrible wretched voices akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill nasal vocals cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew and timmy s dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host guy smiley from sesame street comes to mind the animation is awful even the producers of yu gi oh laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show every character has buck teeth or a square head or a head three sizes too big for his or her body and what s with having the characters speak every single line wide eyed and grinning as though posing for a photo op with the president then there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic not since the subtle grace of amelia bedelia homer simpson and buddy lembeck of charles in charge fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb usually unrealistic is synonymous with unfunny and that is most definitely the case here there hasn t been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since the naked gun 33 1 3 and at least leslie nielson was good at it finally the premise of the show and it s the same every single episode so big time spoiler alert here timmy wishes for something with his two fairly oddparents something goes wrong there s always some contrived reason why he can t immediately reverse course and wish away the damage and then everything turns out just fine in the end oh and on a side note timmy s parents never believe him when he complains about vicky and they continue to employ her at every opportunity maybe it s just me but it seems that a kids show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn t a great idea if you re writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen the fairly odd parents has to be a great place to start a prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it 
__label__0 most would agree that the character of wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history i m no marvel expert but i did grow up with the adventures of the x men and definitely approved of hugh jackman s now widely known portrayal of the scruffy logan i enjoyed the first x men found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment all through the three movies i probably enjoyed jackman more than anything else i figured the idea of making an origins movie about wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three x men movies if we concentrate on one character i figured there could be a movie that achieves what i found the second movie failed at being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure the reason that the wolverine movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after the dark knight it s not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary even though that certainly isn t good no it s because the movie doesn t even seem to try to begin with this does not qualify as good entertainment there is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very very automatic with no greater special effects or elements of suspense and when one event will make you predict the following five it almost feels like an uwe boll movie imitating an action adventure movie concept that you ve seen a dozen times before of course nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of bolls t but when everybody s talking clichés as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough but there is an even bigger problem even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities i think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title i mean origins really what to the people behind this movie think about that title what do they mean you want to know the origins of wolverine he grew up with his brother they ran away from home during dramatic circumstances then they went off to war all of them the civil war world war i and ii and vietnam too why did they do this still unknown eventually the brother sabertooth played by liev shrieber became evil how you ask i don t know it was somewhere between omaha beach and hanoi yeah but why you still ask i just said i don t know the movie doesn t explain he s evil alright yeah but you know origins yeah well that s an origin i mean duh anyway eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers something with the government ho hum wolvie gets enough and leave his brother for six years he s a happy lumberjack with a loved one who ends up a little defenseless around the time sabretooth suddenly appears again yeaaah but whyyyy oh shut up and wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh covered metal war animal he goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped cue x men the first movie there that s the origin you can also find it on the back of the dvd cover the actual movie won t tell you anything else with no worthwhile scenes of action no good heroes villains or characters in general lines from my couch audience fat suit token black guy oh i give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie that is supposed to be gambit mmhm yeah well uh huh right not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a t shirt with added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right fans will check this out or have already there s no stopping that but if you liked the x men movies for no other reason than that they were well made and entertaining see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none

__label__1 when this film opened back in 1976 legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain it was widely considered a failure i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at cannes apparently these people didn t understand the movie which is not that hard to comprehend since it s very esoteric dark and layered in ways that still astound me reading through many of the reviews here i find even after about 7 8 viewings over the years many elements of the film i had previously glossed over but even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story it s still a cracking suspenser even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes polanski s title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it s two hour running time examining the source material an excellent novella by underrated novelist roland topor uncovers more intriguing layers polanski s trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life letting it direct him he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes he finds himself gently pushed this way and that but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless this vague sort of wishy washy ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie but there are hints of it early in the film too making a play for the apartment of a woman one mademouiselle choule who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain he soon finds however that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door instead of taking a stand though trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution he becomes obsessed with choule imagining himself to be like her dressing like her etc as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity if anyone has ever doubted polanski s fearlessness as an artist they d be well advised to see this film his trademark black humor is prominently and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and god bless him he makes himself the butt of it it s a tour de force performance in one of the richest riskiest most gothic horror movies ever made that more people haven t seen it is a true crime 
__label__0 there are few uplifting things to say about this but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent we end up with movies like this lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take here she can only fail children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children although still pretty dumb the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes and as a family sports movie this is horrible the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car bash fest creating some tension if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part being able to leave the multiplex in your own car 
__label__1  once in the life is a very good movie however it s not good for everybody due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations the movie manages to represent in an anecdotic believable way the life in nyc neighborhoods where drug problems are important this depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue on video it s ok there is a little overplay sometimes but i think it fits quite well to the general orientation fishburne gave to the movie which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise notably in the time action management the characters even though not simple are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at impersonating them by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack b marsalis if you re not too prude you should enjoy seeing that movie once twice three times i rated the movie 9 10 
__label__1 i am a huge fan of simon pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh neither did how to lose friends and alienate people this movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off however he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous but in the end he ends up doing them the culture of life the movie is well toned with humor romance good acting and also a bit of a lap dance its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends 
__label__0 this was god awful the story was all over the place and more often than not i was confused because of horrible editing i felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough they were extremely superficial people with no dimension cheesy cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere the stripper chick was just a distraction even if she was decent looking i don t know what this was attempting to be but how shocked was i when they showed this trash on sundance i almost cancelled my subscription you d think a channel like that would show more quality films there are much much better gay and lesbian themed films out there the celluloid closet is an excellent documentary i thoroughly enjoyed wigstock the movie i m sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment but what i m trying to say is that this just wasn t worth it if you catch it on tv ok but otherwise don t bother there were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice sad i can count them on one hand otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well the lighting was way off in a lot of places i think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it i can t deny johnny rebel is pretty hot without the blond hair of course too bad his acting did nothing for me stick with real porn buddy 3 10

__label__1 following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week i d say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately especially the young couple with a baby having serious issues phenomenon is very familiar to me as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland the relationships and problems of people fragility of the marriage institution the drinking culture unemployment and the ascending money problem all are very well put without any subjectivity or exaggeration there are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound but as said above the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of real life and captivate the viewer i happen to think in a calm moment what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street well this is what is happening movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries but it particularly reflects finland as it is and pretty damn well one comment about the acting being the fan of finnish cinema i am i ve never seen any of these actors on any other movie but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall maybe not a masterpiece but a very good try by the entire crew i ll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast 7 5 10
__label__0 an offensively over the top action adventure first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it s release in the mid 80 s with right wing reaganism and virulent anti red feelings still not finished yet though the emergence of a certain mikhail gorbachev in the heart of the evil empire in moscow would soon render these types of films redundant even reagan himself eventually admitted this truism in that sense we can be most grateful to gorby not for his disarmament treaties with the us nor his policies of glasnost or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet union s backyard no it s the final diminution of foolish jingoistic bloated cold war adventures like this the first rambo film was hardly perfect though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline in this sequel any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped vietnamese and russian troops to rescue american pow s ten years after the conflict ended with the americans on the losing side perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box office success was to let many americans wallow in fantasy they may have lost the war but there was still unfinished business at hand and ludicrous comic strip heroics with a robot like hero killing virtually every red on sight with as much hardware as possible fulfilled such whimsically far fetched ideals this could have been entertaining on a superman spiderman level but sadly everything is played absolutely straight but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind the action scenes though technically adequate never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts namely our hero rambo is always unscathed aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there despite the tons of explosives grenades gunshots etc going around him in between the mayhem what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichés and banalities stallone who co wrote the script with james cameron a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english and merely comes out with moronic grunts almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles napier and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given and steven berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian kgb red army villain roles berkoff s overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing how come that sly managed to survive berkoff s electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red commie scumbags well credibility is never this film s strong point it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz at least that was meant to be a fantasy and an immortal classic it turned out to be this is only a classic of the most dismal and indeed offensive kind and as for sly s climactic speech rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people eh by the way in the same year he also made rocky iv rating 3 out of 10 
__label__1  a truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love describes this odd david lynch film this was especially odd because it wasn t the kind of film lynch had been putting out in the last 15 20 years those were dark and shocking films blue velvet wild at heart mulholland drive and this is the opposite i know it disappointed a lot of his fans others were delighted by it count me as one of the latter and i own all three of those dark films too this was another supposed true life story here detailing an elderly man s trip in a seated lawnmower from western iowa all the way to wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn t talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies well i guess that premise an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles still makes this an odd film of sorts so lynch stays in character with that richard farnsworth plays the title role he is the type of guy face wise voice wise low key personality wise that just about everyone likes the wrinkles on his face tell many a story it was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released the first 25 minutes of this film isn t much and not always pleasant as it shows the main character s adult and mentally challenged child sissy spacek and her tragic past but once alvin straight farnsworth begins his trip the story picks up i played this for several friends and they thought the film never picked up but i am more generous with it i think it s a hidden gem to them it was a sleeping pill i found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is not going to be a suspenseful lynch crime story it is slow and if that s okay with you you might like this charm enters the picture in some of people alvin meets along the way such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble henry cada as daniel riordan is a standout in that regard harry dean stanton gets third billing but that s a joke he s only in the final few minutes of the movie the iowa scenery is pleasant i lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil it s a nice state with nice people like this movie 
__label__0 i ve barely just made it through one episode crouch end the dialog was stilted and down right cringe worthy the acting was tragic eion bailey despite his best attempts to be dramatic remains mostly expressionless his eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment claire forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie the characters were cartoons each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random meandering plot cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story if i had to compare it s overall quality to something else i d put this episode of nightmares and dreamscapes on par with the nbc s hercules 
__label__0 i won t argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable as is january jones s performance but please check her out if you haven t already in the amc tv series mad men starting later this month she s excellent as is the entire cast i ll charitably assume she took on the taboo role strictly for the money and realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation don t know if that s the case but i now know for sure that she can act at first watching taboo i was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot no such luck hard to believe the director didn t suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw ironically her winning performance in mad men comes as a character who at least in her early appearances is very repressed reserved unsure of herself and rather colorless not unlike her taboo role but as the tv series progressed she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early 60 s whitebread mom role can t wait to see where they take her character in the 2nd season to sum up avoid taboo like leprosy but definitely check out mad men 
__label__0 this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a bad thing that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts all that s missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking where d you hear that or that can t possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless em the regular folks in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it s a condition shared by the movie s rock stars as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i ve enjoyed and i m sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor nash seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can t possibly believe the things he s being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever stand and fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they re not being patronizing nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn t mean much to them at all it s worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the 70s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one it s worth noting because that s symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly life or death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they re playing the catskills except maybe gil scott heron his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high schooler impressed with how controversial he s being only bruce springsteen s performance raises a pulse i ve never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely smokes no question part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general blandness and air of self satisfaction here it s no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rock n roll but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting i don t expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second cutaways to a back up singer s tonsils now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch rust never sleeps or the last waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians so really there s only two things to watch this movie for springsteen s stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter culture in decline 
__label__1 i wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on walter jack palance blackie certainly he looks like no one else of the time that skull like face flattened nose and elongated body even now he remains an unsettling presence and what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy new orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague blackie is loosing on the city i m just sorry he didn t have more scenes the movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue s black humor the widmark douglas interplay the un touristy locations the battles among officials all are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time even widmark s domestic scenes that put a woman bel geddes on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive director kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio fox product no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect widmark does a solid low key job as the public health officer but my money is on the one and only zero mostel was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy e g the enforcer 1950 that scene with mostel where palance argues with mostel s shrewish wife liswood is a gem of frantic subservience as mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist i wonder if it was the voluble kazan who named him but it s not only the professionals that add color the locals add both character and authenticity especially the two asian guys interviewed by the cops that whole scene has an improvised air as if kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot then too that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration and what about those flea bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest denny s anyway the movie is still a well staged riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of today s mega hits 
__label__0 a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski s an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier ask the dust was the first fante book i read and it remains one of my favorite novels the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of in the novel the protagonist is a virgin with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla how he settles for his first sexual experience with a wounded admirer and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real with no touching hollywood ending the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism sickness and death the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f ing crazy and their love never was and never would be the real thing no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock i can t believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong

__label__0 just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof kate capshaw does she still get work as his wife slight age difference and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer weird casting but the movie plays serious mindf with the audience don t read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers first of all i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence the coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl because he is black connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty he is approached by the convicted man s grandmother to defend him and re open the trial connery is stonewalled yawn by the small town officials and the good il boys club but finds that the case against blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him the beating was administered by a black cop who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting hannibal lecter like ed harris he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon he gets a re trial and blair is freed i think film over then suddenly it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist connery he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris now blair is on the loose again thanks to connery s deluded pc principles the final 30 min are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts yes you read that right in the everglades that was one weird film so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry truly depressing on every level the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too two thumbs down connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something 
__label__1 i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet i say potential we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas but i hope not for those that have not seen it see it without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the vulcan babe is hot too check out the decontamination scene i gave this a full 10 it blows away all the other series openers i hope this goes longer than 7 years 
__label__1 in ten words or less to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful except for the perhaps tacked on ending but i love happy endings anyway barbara stanwyck however as the platinum blonde gold digger is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is sexy and excellent 
__label__1 five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in hong kong film history director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms meng lo plays yet another bad ass he would go on to be in super ninjas kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled any chop socky fan can apperciate this but i still think it ain t as good as super ninjas also made by chang cheh but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best 
__label__1 one word can describe this movie and that is weird i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting well it was the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not very strange if you are a fan of animation science fiction you might want to check this out 
__label__1 some people have stated that as of the 11th season south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs but this could not be further from the truth while this episode does spoof the living dead series there is more it is a satire of how people treat the homeless characters say things like they re pretending to be just like us or they want to be human this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luck so yes it is still a satire and also a wonderful spoof what more could you want 
__label__0 this movie is horrible it rivals ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a 3 save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever 
__label__0 i really love the sexy action and sci fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress s that appeared in them they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn t matter if they could act remember candy the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn t nostalgic enough the story here has a european sci fi film called dragonfly being made and the director is fired so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker jeremy davies to complete the picture they re is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she s barely in it film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law barbarella gerard depardieu giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well i guess i m going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties if any are reading this make it as sexy as you can i ll be waiting 
__label__0 ugh another one of those fooled by the cover dvds i expected some kind of action at least with bears cats such on the cover i got nothing bad movie i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen no luck now the reason i gave this a 2 is because of the scenery otherwise it sucked the kid was terrible talking to himself although i suppose they couldn t just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and what a dumbass kicking a porcupine and he wouldn t be pulling those quills out that easily either they stick like fishhooks at least he fought the bear weakly a couple of times what was up with the flashback thing it made a bad movie even worse i wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce what else can i say well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something at least that would have been more exciting people don t waste your time on this one 
__label__0  how she moves springs to life only when its high energy talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera otherwise this stale strive suffer and succeed story is low on energy low on originality and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other likeminded films that have come before it rutina wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step dance competitions but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction as noted earlier the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting 
__label__0 this movie has not aged well maybe it s just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that we ve seen with the sopranos but i just viewed prizzi s honor for the first time on dvd alone the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but i have to say i was just appalled at the ending not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending i enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character also when was this move supposed to be set the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the world trade center towers completed in 1973 were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person somehow mid 1980s audiences found this film charming and funny mid eighties meet the late oughts only of you can live 
__label__1 this one and her pilgrim soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series there s something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned it s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling s version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite i remember i wasn t surprised by the korean movie il mare later remade into the lake house i think it s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film 
__label__0 there s so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just can t stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen here s a side you haven t heard yet elvis presley s movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i don t have to think when i watch them that means i don t have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy going rock n roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all in my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad it s good category now if you re like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate 1960 s camp experience it s so bad that it s almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can t possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end you re so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don t know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because it s so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it 1 out of 10 though once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic 
__label__1 ossessioneluchino visconti s debut film this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement well it says so right on the back of the box and is a sometimes penetrating sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux set in fascist italy an assortment of supporting characters including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without drifting phantasms longing for a soul although visconti s compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well developed the spider web of deceit is tenuous although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it the cosmic irony too didactic the illicit relationship strained with bathos all the same it s incisive and essential although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable 
__label__0 i ll start with what i liked i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everything i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene but that s about it i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way 3 stars for the songs :)
__label__0 this movie was worth five punches on my hurter card i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid 70 s i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it it sucked it was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid i ve ever seen i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome i offer you this if it was so awesome what was it s box office take end of discussion 
__label__1 but it s worth watching for boyer lorre and paxinou greene s entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to american shores as in this gun for hire or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit bacall fits that part here i kept waiting for her to whistle and bring bogie to life her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class englishwoman but listen to the dialogue no people don t talk that way except in books but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world one other positive note greene s range of characters were kept whole while mr mukerjee resembled more a brahamin at least his nationality was kept and his final conversation with paxinou is priceless 
__label__1  1 2 out of while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned it should be noted as it seems to reside in many quebecois native hearts however this was a movie as a child that i was a fervent admirer of keeping in mind now that it was made for children i rate it on a relative basis the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort and jostling back n forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons if i had children this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in as the snow fort wowed me when i was young and i think even children today would agree albeit with pixar and all the computer animation maybe i am out of date and just don t realize it in addition the movie s message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that for children and adults alike 
__label__1 having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village broadway area i couldn t wait to see it s final copy viewing this film at the cleveland premier last friday i haven t laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he s great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael jeter s as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie 
__label__1 the bourne ultimatum jason bourne matt damon in his best role ever the newest spy kid on the block brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia s latest program blackbriar to make super assassins like himself i was so psyched for this one that i watched it s predecessors yesterday and today identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak but still enjoyable link in the chain for the weakest plot and aside from a car chase which this film s chase easily tops slight lacking in action and suspense hoo boy does ultimatum have suspense even when you know bourne will escape the authorities and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept it s still brilliant watching him do it it s mind boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in transformers chalk it up to paul greengrass who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary even though he s filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe inspiring with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick a hardcover book i ll never look at those the same way again and an electric fan don t ask the music also helped generate much suspense and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail bite over the acting is good and the evolution of julia stiles character nicky put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity this longing of his for a real life could get boring and almost did in supremacy but just works better in ultimatum better script i am reminded of a scene in goldeneye the only good pierce brosnan bond film in which sean bean s character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he s killed bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers or at least made me consider the meaning of action without purpose life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources albeit resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything sidenote it s always bothered me that despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia interpol and the police nearly anywhere he goes that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports sunglasses maybe if you have a pulse and love action movies than bourne ultimatum is for you hell it s probably the best action film to come out this year of course you d be a fool to see it without watching the others first it kind of drags a touch near the end but i almost feel tempted to overlook that this is the first 3 movie this summer to at least match if not exceed the original and that is saying something a 
__label__1 then you must see this film to understand the reality having read the book ms duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder formerly labeled manic depression it is hard to believe that in this day and age people still critique others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists and this is unfortunate in this film the audience sees the pain and suffering ms duke had been through especially as a child many of us may remember her from the teenage patty duke show she was a household name in america by age 15 you learn of her exploitation by the ross well played by howard hesseman as she was growing up in the 1950 s the stigma was in full force however we see as she advances in her career yet the illness becomes worse she goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity even marries someone whom she divorces the next week and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication a recent survey released by nami national alliance on mental illness recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder it also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted to bp magazine winter 2006 if you watch this film you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not pull herself up by her bootstraps and get well until she was educated about her disorder and received proper treatment thank you ms duke for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice 
__label__1 rachel mcadams cillian murphy wes craven the dream team this is one of the best thrillers of 2005 a great plot a great twist a great eye candy this is one of wes craven s greatest movies apart from scream and a nightmare on elm street this could be the best the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple lisa reisert mcadams a struggling hotel manager boards a late red eye back to la little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper murphy they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa s hotel and what does this have to with lisa well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn t ripner will murder her father brian cox the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005 definitely worth the see 3 1 2 out of 4 stars
__label__0 ignoring if possible the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking which seems to be mandatory in australian government funded films the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance that s a far as it goes the rest is simply awful the plot s overburdened with wow symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere a gross example is the giant peach float obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory it was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free but nevertheless irrelevant prop the peach is given a cursory unexplained wash down at one stage but that s where it ends similarly the contrived black spot road sign where steph s parents were killed is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past but her escape to what she s had a pretty good deal where she was especially considering her visual disability and the unending loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian the guinness prize for corny melodrama however goes to the characterization of alan alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi national hiss hiss as a supervisor alan performs the boss villainous dirty work he implements redundancies until surprise surprise the whole plant is closed and alan himself is left as a pathetic unemployed failure no cliché free zones here mate not only this but alan also loses the seductive steph from the most unlikely relationship you d encounter if you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic don t ask about detail what s the significance of the shaving cream on steph s seductive leg why doesn t the hotel where the couple makes love eventually twig that someone s gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and among other pandemoniums the sheets are regularly soiled quite spectacularly on one occasion summing this movie up in one word avoid avoid avoid 
__label__1 don t waste time reading my review go out and see this astonishingly good episode which may very well be the best columbo ever written ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son in law to avenge his murder of her daughter columbo is his usual rumpled befuddled and far cleverer than he seems self and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk ironically this was not written by heralded creators levinson or link yet is possibly the densest most thoroughly original and twist laden columbo plot ever utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all 10 10 seek this one out on netflix 
__label__0 in a way corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them laugh les visiteurs has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about zemeckis s back to the future here comes the old france the middle age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor then comes the sequel nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of les visiteurs the first and it s no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money the general story begins after the end of les visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought explanation it s no use trying to get back the jewelry jacquouille has stolen don t you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode where do you think he found the money selling the jewelry and that s only one of many holes poiré tries to avoid and fails let s have a look at the characters montmirail doesn t change he s just a little more boring regarding frenegonde that s another story valérie lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her and poiré doesn t realize that a cast of humorists isn t enough to make a good comedy forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you ll see that there s enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times the main interest of this film is the landscapes a movie for youngsters let s say up to 13 years old 
__label__0 a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this film in fact what is the point of it the scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline the performances of the cast are questionable if not believable did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequel 
__label__1 there are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious political and societal means not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society all in the name of allah or god or some other ridiculous justification but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject the setting is the 2006 match between iran and bahrain to qualify for the world cup passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match the women who were caught played by sima mobarak shahi shayesteh irani ayda sadeqi golnaz farmani and mahnaz zabihi and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and most likely all muslim countries their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them both city and villagers and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules it is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it s women from the crude behavior of it s men rather than educating the male population they deny privilege and rights to the women seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in iran but jafar panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it 
__label__1 this is a really funny and sexy movie that is not just silly but has great acting it s the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater i saw it at the boston film festival and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the movie s more serious parts it s a unique movie about two doctors and i don t want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones plus the dialogue is great wood harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles if you get a chance to see it go you won t be disappointed it s worth seeing again wood harris deserves an award 
__label__1 although i bought the dvd when it first came out and have watched it several times i never wrote a review i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still sadly it seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow up i have to assume qt still controls the rights but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty with another tough female lead anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let down peter o donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers the tug of wills between modesty and miklos is very true to the source material and is tense suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn t have to have gore and explosions alexandra did a great job in playing how o donnell s character would have taken control of the situation i find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of batman and james bond after 2 dismal earlier efforts although not nearly as well known to the public this is really a reboot of the modesty character and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made 
__label__0 perhaps because i was so young innocent and brainwashed when i saw it this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me i haven t seen it since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now however i will say that it left an impression on me and most of my friends it did serve its purpose at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions i was particularly terrified of what the newly converted post rapture christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast i don t want to spoil the movie for those who haven t seen it so i will not mention details of the scenes but i can still picture them in my head and it s been 19 years 
__label__1 first off i hadn t seen the blob since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s fear of teenagers but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world but the blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don t believe them in fact there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy colored world and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him to sum up if you can take off your postmodern irony filter there s a lot more to love here than meets the eye 
__label__0 well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people it is patently awful nothing makes sense in this movie there is way too many subplots for a start josh hartnett s character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo harrison ford s character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigator s ex wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which ford s character calls from time to time nonsense i can t remember the characters names that s how forgettable this is so i ll refer to them as ford and hartnett then there s the dialogue which is brutal i mean cringe inducing stuff here throw in every cliché in the book having a heart to heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name the duo being investigated by internal affairs why hartnett confronting his dad s killer and you ve got one hell of a mess as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non existent 1 when ford s car is being repossessed how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked were they following him 2 when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene an earring is replicated on of the charred bodies there that was lucky 3 when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett centers himself with a yoga pose on the table instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him then inexplicably the two are released without answering any questions 4 during the car chase hartnett s car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again not a scratch 5 when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at 6 when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett s car ford is trying to close a real estate deal come on 7 the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label they might leave his label and it s a warning to keep his other groups loyal but hang on how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan 8 why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end there is no explication 9 and hartnett gets to use his acting to capture the bad guy in the end i could go on i really could anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that s all it is there s nothing else to it it s not supposed to be satirical or ironic it s just crap 
__label__0 how disney can you get preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson is disney trying to send a lesson to itself that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human whatever the psycho analysis this movie sucked the girls want a rich party for their rich lives but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant yes milk going to employ the workers they keep it afloat until daddy comes home and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb webcam in the cayman islands huh not worth my time ever again but it is better than howl s moving castle d 
__label__0 it s interesting at first a naive park ranger colin firth marries a pretty mysterious woman lisa zane he s only known for a short time they seem to be happy then she disappears without warning he searches for her and after a few dead ends stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past which may include criminal activity and then it seems the filmmakers didn t know what to do with the story the beginning while not as suspenseful as it sounds is at least watchable then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense and the ending is so lame so dull and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence you ll think the screenwriters didn t know what to do with it and got bored trying what a sorry waste of a good idea 
__label__0 don t get me wrong the movie is beautiful the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic however it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done bbc s planet earth was all of the above and more it was subtle it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death there was tragedy and triumph loss and gain it was balanced disney s edit of earth is none of this they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about they made it dramatic they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us they made predators evil they made walruses evil they showed every encounter as negative it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded but at the expense of the lesson of balance the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive i am all for preventing global warning but this was over the top political and environmental junk that s another thing i went to see it on the big screen but was disappointed in the picture quality it looked better on my tv at home if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture go out and buy rent or borrow the bbc s planet earth series it is better lessons better sound and if you have blu ray better picture quality 
__label__1 made in 1931 this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often we open on a quiet little french village scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens then we hear something that sounds like a party upon investigating the uproar two neighboring men are told the story of two men supposedly friends who picked two numbers for the lottery our star of the picture has his number and his friend his when he asks his friend would he share half of the dough should his ticket be the winning number his friend promptly says no in fact h e double hockey sticks no is the way he acts about it so when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost through no fault of his own he is frantic everyone is out for themselves looking for this ticket in something like a precursor to the great race even though this is all a flashback i was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all for me show me the money cash in the bank film watch le million today 
__label__1 in this installment of the series edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain during the later portion of george iii s rule this time blackadder s prospects are much poorer as instead of royalty he s a servant to the very very thick george iv the price regent unlike the historical accounts of george iv this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result blackadder s able to take advantage of him and scheme to his heart s content the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very very very different note you just have to see it to believe it other than that all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious the only reservation i have as always is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations 
__label__0 awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming crisp location photography but it s too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldn t make it back in time because really she was saddled with the wet in more ways than one husband and she had an idiot child as well why not run off with meeker but the nagging question remains what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didn t float stanwyck always impeccably professional does the best she could with the material but it s threadbare 
__label__1 i enjoyed it in general i m not a fan of comedies and comedians but i do like whoopi i m also partial to sci fi fantasy and the dinosaur craze i read for pleasure but when i m feeling over stressed or really mind dead i watch tv movies to escape theodore rex enabled me to do so that makes it a success in my eyes i didn t even walk away to do something else while it was running whether or not it was rated as good or not doesn t really matter to me and no i m not a juvenile nor am i a moron

__label__1 jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing it s like watching a no frills music video today the jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street i had never heard her sing before bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday that s a compliment folks their instrumental work is tops as well with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes this film is to be watched and treasured no great production values just a lot of good music 
__label__0 they re showing this on some off network it s well crap while it is not as bad as the b movies they show on the sci fi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly sub standard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they re wrapping things up before the credits not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they re playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time it s not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
