It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people. Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea.\"\n",

We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole \\\"navy talk\\\" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead.

The people are all equally dark, cold and mysterious and that's just not the way people are or at least behave. For Non-German audience it is probably easier to get into but the show is set in Germany in German language. And no one here talks that way, like an emotionless robot (maybe that's the way we are seen by the world but it's not true). So every dialogue of the show reminded me just how different and stylish it wants to be, completely forgetting human depth or even basic human feelings (when you begin to ask yourself if there is any character capable of loving, even if it's just their family members, you know there is something wrong).\"\n",

The acting is great, the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is awesome (reminds me of Klaus Schulze at times), and the story-line is mind-boggling.

The shots are random and unmotivated, even for a comedy. I love comedies and Andy Samberg, but the writing is so awful. I don't see how a writer could be happy showing this to anyone, and the producers must of been so eager for a script that they couldn't recognize how terrible it is. The editing and sound mixing look like they've been done by amateurs. Besides the few creative cinematic shots and the three or four decent lines of dialogue, there's absolutely nothing good about this film and anyone who things this is great must have a very low intellect and appreciation of good films.\"\n",
