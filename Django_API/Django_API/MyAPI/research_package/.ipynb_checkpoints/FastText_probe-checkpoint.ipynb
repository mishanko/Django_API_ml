It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people. Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea.\"\n",

    "review_6 = \"It was just OK which is reflected in my 6 star rating, which I think is generous. They made little effort at any sort of character development. Hanks has some sort of love interest that is hinted at, but that's it. I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole \\\"navy talk\\\" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead. I couldn't imagine a better resting place than the open sea. I was air force and not really sure what we did. Threw bodies out the back of a C130? That'd be cool with me.\"\n",
